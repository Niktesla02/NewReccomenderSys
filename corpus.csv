0,Second Thoughts: Come with old Khayyam ,NAVTEJ SARNA,2010-05-06,18:56:53 IST,"The other day, halfway through a virtual conversation, or chat, I found myself unable to recall a much loved rubai of Omar Khayyam. This lapse, unimaginable in one’s youth but part of the daily landscape now, soon had me searching the bookshelves. I was looking for my Omar Khayyam and unconsciously, I was looking for that coverless, disintegrating Jaico edition that I had bought in the mid-1970s for two or three rupees from the booksellers who used to shout “take a look, buy a book” in the corridors of Connaught Place. The book with the tempting sketches of the hedonist resting against a tree and drinking cups of heady wine from the hands of a sinuous saki under a full moon, sketches which, in a summer of artistic delusion, I copied on chart paper and hung all over my room. But that book was nowhere to be found; it has not survived the three dozen years and the dozen or so moves. Instead, I found three other Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, each an embodiment of pure physical beauty. The first, barely the size of a pocket dictionary, has a rich rust-brown cover depicting a medieval garden with intertwining branches, full-bodied roses, singing birds and fruits in the boughs. Each page featuring a single rubai, or quatrain in Persian, is framed like a carpet from the same land. The English version, with 102 rubais cramped into a few pages, is based on Edward Fitzgerald’s translation from the first of his five editions. This edition can be distinguished from the later ones by slight differences in some of the rubais. The most famous of these is: Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough,/A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou…….; in the third and later editions this becomes: A book of verses underneath the bough/A jug of wine, a loaf of bread – and thou…I found this little gem of a book in the bookshop in the gardens of Hafiz’s tomb in Shiraz, where newly-weds come to seek the blessings and a turbaned dervish with deep set eyes and a flowing beard walks around the chai-khanah. The second is a very slim 1955 production that I found tucked away in a second-hand bookstore bursting at the seams. The rubais, once again based on Fitzgerald’s first edition, are all inscribed on dull yellow pages and the remarkable accompanying miniature depictions of hedonistic abandon are in the same yellow and pastel pink. This edition satisfies itself with 75 quatrains and ends with the emblematic signature phrase Tamam Shud or “it is finished.” And the third has nothing miniature about it; it is a large, lush and generous coffee table book entitled The Wine of Nishapur harking to the capital of Khorasan, which once rivalled Cairo and Baghdad and where Khayyam was born in 1048, as well as buried in 1131. This book is based on the belief that in order to fully understand Khayyam, it is not enough to master the Persian language; one has to be Iranian and have “breathed the same air, felt the same spring breeze on his cheeks, enjoyed the same picnic in the meadow…”Using an all-Iranian team, it combines the English rendering of 72 rubais by Karim Emami and the skilful Persian calligraphy of Nasrollah Afje’i with the perceptive photography of the man who has put it all together - Shahrokh Golestan. The photographs are a non-literal, philosophical take on Khayyam- red sunshades of a side-walk café (each Nowruz hold tulip-fashion a bowl of wine), a long shadow of a passerby (whence is the entrance and whereto our exit?), the sun’s last rays on raindrops (the moon will wax and wane over and over again)… Incidentally, nobody quite knows how many rubais Khayyam actually wrote. In the oldest extant manuscript, copied 500 years ago in Shiraz and now held in the Bodleian Library, there are 158. In later versions, succeeding scribes added more until the total swelled to nearly 1200. Edward Fitzgerald culled out the essential ones and rendered them in a free English translation, or as he called it a “transmogrification,” in 1859. He did not pretend to be too faithful to the original, often combining more than one rubai to make a brilliant whole that reads as one poem and not as separate epigrammatic quatrains. Incidentally, there was an Indian connection: his colleague, Prof. Edward Cowell discovered a Persian manuscript of the rubaiyat in the Asiatic Society of Calcutta and sent it to him. The resulting book went almost unnoticed and was soon in the one-penny boxes on the streets until it found admirers in the poets Rosetti and Swinburne (followed by Hardy, Elliot and Conan-Doyle) and went on to become one of the most famous, essential and oft-quoted books for the next 100 years. In his lifetime, Omar Khayyam was known not as a poet but as a philosopher, mathematician and astronomer. It is difficult to believe that his most influential work was a treatise that demonstrated the problems of algebra in which he solved cubic equations through intersecting conic sections; if you don’t understand that, please join the club. He made far-reaching reforms to the Persian calendar, linking it to actual solar transit. He was in fact the precursor to non-Euclidian geometry and to a heliocentric view of the world. In addition, he wrote on mechanics, geography and jurisprudence.It is for this work that the man - who has hundreds of wine-houses named after him - is also commemorated in a lunar crater on the far side of the moon and in a minor planet - 3095 Omarkhayyam - discovered in 1980. One can only conclude that his scientific mind and philosophical bent questioned Divine providence and finding no answers to the perplexities that he encountered, he preferred to focus on the fleeting and sensual pleasures of the material world. Fitzgerald’s rendering of Khayyam’s rubaiyat has eclipsed the other achievements of this remarkable man, at least to the English speaking world, in a manner best expressed by Khayyam himself: 
Indeed the idols I have loved so long

Have done my credit in mens’ eye much wrong;

Have drowned my honour in a shallow cup

And sold my reputation for a song.

3,Staging a change,SANGEETA BAROOAH PISHAROTY,2010-05-06,17:10:30 IST,"Sitanath Lahkar has made his passion blossom. Photo: Anu Pushkarna
  Mathematics is his earning source, theatre his soul. Sitanath Lahkar, professor of mathematics at the prestigious Cotton College in Guwahati, has long been a student of theatre, an ardent advocate of the curative powers of arts, particularly theatre, in a society that is in constant flux. His group, Samahar Natya Goshti, which celebrated its silver jubilee last year, has a repertoire of about 50 plays, all scripted by Lahkar. “I act, direct and write plays. That way, I am a one-man theatre group,” he says in jest.In New Delhi on a private visit, Lahkar languidly reconstructs his initiation into theatre. “No one from my family did plays before me. In 1965, as a school student in Nalbari, I staged a one-act-play. It became a local sensation. I should say that was my starting point.” Having continued his interest in play-acting and play-writing for years, Lahkar came up with the idea of his own troupe in early 1984. “But it got its impetus after theatre activist Safdar Hashmi was killed in 1989. As a group that began with the slogan of theatre with a purpose, we took Safdar's murder as a serious blow to our goal,” he recollects. Soon after, Samahar started street theatre, not just in Guwahati but in remote villages across the North East. “Samahar has 19 street plays. We did about 350 shows then to tremendous response. We were the only group then to do street plays in the region,” he mentions.Lahkar brought his “Kahiyo Sandhi Das” to the 2003 edition of Bharat Rang Mahotsav in New Delhi. He says, “All our plays are about issues touching our society. This play is about surrendered terrorists, termed SULFA. In 1996, when many ULFA cadres surrendered to the Government, they became legalised terrorists. While they got all the Government privileges, they also continued with their armed extortions. It became a new problem in our society.”Among other interesting subjects his plays have dealt with are Assam's student agitation, the serial blasts in Assam, the State's notorious LoC financial scam, the Babri Masjid demolition, communalism, casteism and unemployment.Believes Lahkar, “That serious plays don't attract common people is an utter lie. I have done plays in the interiors, sometimes with just one tube light on, in both bitter cold and scorching summer. I have always got a full house.”In a village called Sokihali in Lower Assam some time ago, he says, “We staged a play in front of 9,000 people. The sound system didn't work for 45 minutes. People waited till it became all right. In yet another place near Nalbari, we performed the play ‘Matir Dheep' in front of 3,000 people with just Petromax lights.”To Lahkar also goes the credit of reviving the memory of Brajanath Sarma, considered the father of the popular mobile theatre in Assam. Sarma was also the first to introduce women actors to the stage. In his memory, every September since 2007, Samahar hosts the Brajanath Sarma Memorial Drama Festival, inviting theatre groups from across the North East and West Bengal. “We do it between September 12, his birth anniversary, and September 15, his death anniversary,” he adds.With a lot of interest, Lahkar informs us that Samahar now has a permanent address. “Finally, we have managed to have a concrete place for our rehearsals. We started off from a cowshed,” he says with a laugh. Paucity of actors, particularly due to lack of money in theatre, he adds, “is a serious problem.”“Most actors in my troupe work elsewhere to run their homes. Often they find it difficult to take out time for rehearsals. It has been a constant problem not just with my troupe but with most in the region. There is hardly any sponsor available. Rabindra Bhavan, the only big auditorium in Guwahati, charges Rs.10,000 for one shift, while we sell tickets to theatregoers for Rs.20 each. It is not easy for theatre groups to survive there,” he points out.Samahar's “Ma Nishada” found a place in the National School of Drama's Octave festival held in Goa last year but Lahkar sums up the conversation stating, “NSD should consider bringing out new plays of new groups from the region to a wider audience every year. But the same troupes keep getting invitations to Bharat Rang Mahotsav year after year.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Staging-a-change/article16298768.ece
4,In Ghalib's skin,DIWAN SINGH BAJELI,2010-05-06,16:49:22 IST,"“In recent years, we have seen several plays and a few serials on Mirza Ghalib. They have caricaturised a great poet by focusing on his relationship with courtesans and their coquetry, Ghalib's drinking and gambling habits interspersed with his popular ghazals. I was pained to see them and decided to project the real personality of the great poet in the context of his troubled personal life and the history and culture of his times. For five years, I studied works by Indian as well as foreign scholars on Ghalib and finally completed the project,” says Charan Das Sindhu, author of 36 plays. “Ghalib-e-Azam,” his latest offering, was premiered at Shri Ram Centre recently under the direction of Ravi Taneja, his son-in-law.
Creative vision
Endowed with a unique creative vision, he writes in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi with equal felicity. His Ghalib is a great poet and a great man who suffered one heartbreak after another and was betrayed by his close relatives. “The death of one child is too much of a shock that breaks one's heart. Ghalib lost seven children when they were in their infancy but he endured all this displaying great fortitude, sharing these deeply tragic moments with his dear wife Umaro Jaan,” says the playwright. “To add to his woes, he had to look after his mentally ill brother — who is said to have been killed by a British soldier during the 1857 revolt.”In “Ghalib-e-Azam,” Sidhu has dramatised three significant events in Ghalib's life — his struggle to get a family pension from his estate Loharu (Rajasthan), his pain at the untimely death of his children and the deep bond with his wife who silently suffered the loss, and his journey to Calcutta and stay in Banaras. Sidhu says he has incorporated into the thematic structure Ghalib's compassion and faith in man despite betrayals, his profound humanism and his contribution to India's tradition of composite culture.To convey the universal relevance of Ghalib's poetry and life, the playwright has devised a chorus which includes references from Charvak philosophy from the Rig Veda, lyrics from Bulle Shah, Kabir, Nanak, Amir Khusrau, Ravi Das and Tulsi Das. The chorus is aimed at reinforcing the humanistic philosophy of the poet. “I believe in Shajjad Zahir's assessment of Ghalib. He said that Ghalib was much, much ahead of his times and was a visionary and a genius to visualise the dawn of a new era which would ensure man freedom and the light of scientific knowledge. I have tried to dramatise all these aspects in a play that runs to two hours and 40 minutes.”A former professor of English at Hansraj College, Sidhu did his MA and Ph.D. from Madison, Wisconsin, in the U.S. and is passionately devoted to theatre. His 33 published plays in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi have been staged and some translated into EnglishA prolific writer, he was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2003 for his play “Bhagat Singh Shaheed: A Trilogy.” His plays could broadly be placed in three categories — plays of social protest, those that critique the educational system and those based on history.Sidhu never uses literary language in his plays. He comments, “I belong to the tradition of Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Munshi Prem Chand. I use the language spoken by the common man and try to capture its vigorous, vivid and effective expression.”What prompted Sidhu to write one play after another for nearly three decades is the encouragement and collaboration of his family. His wife Gyan Kaur played lead roles in most of his plays, his daughters acted too, and now his son-in-law directs and acts in them. In a way, his entire family is his repertory company.Sindhu's plays have evoked keen interest in the academic field. So far, 15 scholars in Punjabi have obtained their Ph. D. degrees on various aspects of Sidhu's works.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/In-Ghalibs-skin/article16298755.ece
5,‘Theatre is my life’,NEEHAR MISHRA,2010-05-06,16:45:21 IST,"Actor Anjan Srivastava. Photo: Mohammed Yousuf
  | Photo Credit: Mohammed_Yousuf He made his mark in theatre and on television when he successfully essayed the role of a typical common man in “Wagle ki Duniya”. With successful tele-serials and films in his kitty, veteran actor Anjan Srivastav is now all set to appear in a cameo in the SAB TV show “Maniben.com”. Here, he talks to us about his long acting career and his future projects.
Could you tell us something about your the character that you are playing on the show?
I play a retired colonel, who is fond of collecting antiques. He is a man of old values and a high temper. He has collected a scooter which belongs to Maniben. The episodes deal with how she tries to get the scooter back from Colonel.I think Smriti is a great actress, one of the best on television. I worked with her previously in “Viruddh”. I have worked before with Contiloe Productions in a few episodes of “Krishna Arjun” and with SAB in “Sahib Biwi Ke Ghulam”. So all three are well connected with me.
For a large part of your acting career, you kept your bank job. How did you manage?
I feel you should just go on doing work. I pursued my acting career and at the same time I did my bank work on the telephone. Fortunately, my chairman gave me all the necessary facilities. I also managed getting good publicity for the bank with my association with actors. I feel I am just doing what's written. And if you wish, you can manage anything.
You are soon to begin shooting for “Detective Wagle”, a sequel to your famous show ‘Wagle ki Duniya'. How is Wagle from “Wagle ki Duniya” different from Wagle in ‘Detective Wagle'?
Wagle is now retired and he wants to do something after that. His wife is still employed and is frustrated with his attitude. He wants to become a detective now and keeps reading detective books. One day he sees an advertisement in the paper about an actress' ring having been stolen. He goes to the police and offers to help find the ring. The police, of course, do not take him seriously because they don't think a retired clerk can be of much help. The show is about how Wagle becomes a detective and tries to solve the case.
Theatre, television, cinema films…Which is your favourite actor's medium?For me, it's theatre, because it has no technical bar. Every performance, every show in theatre has something new, because unlike film or television, it does not capture you in film. I feel that an actor's job is to create, understand and live a character, which is only truly possible in theatre. Theatre is my life. If it dies, so will I.
What are your future plans?I will soon start shooting for “Detective Wagle” and I also have Farah Khan's film “Tees Maar Khan”. I cannot do just any show. For me, the offer has to be up to the mark. Even when it comes to cinema, I like to do only quality films. I am always ready for Raj Kumar Santoshi and Kundan Shah. They are the ones who discovered me and made me what I am. So for them, I am always there. Other than that, I want to see my children well settled in their career.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/lsquoTheatre-is-my-lifersquo/article16298753.ece
6,Of the star-struck,P. ANIMA,2010-05-06,16:42:00 IST,"A scene from the play.
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr taramandal2 “Taramandal” leaves behind a clutch of endearing, enduring images. Amputated ambitions waft through the play, yet keep the mood light. Probably, that's the strength of “Taramandal”. Written and directed by Neel Chaudhuri, the play presented by Tadpole Repertory, recently took home The Hindu MetroPlus Playwright Award. Performed at Akshara Theatre this past week, “Taramandal” boasts some skilful performances, but its bane is its length.Taking off from Satyajit Ray's short story “Patol Babu, Filmstar,” “Taramandal” burgeons into many tales akin to Patol's fate. If Patol's persistent fascination for acting is smothered by a mere exclamation in a movie, he has many comrades in “Taramandal” — a production predominantly in English with a smattering of Bengali and Hindi. Patol's story runs as the linking thread, as many similar tales of ambition, creativity, heartbreak and disappointment unravel along the way. None of them bog you down by the weight of loss — the lines keep laughter close at hand.The play opens with Patol's dream turning into a nightmare — an actor/king robbed of his crown. The sentiment is of an aspirant reaching out to his/her aspiration, yet never finding it within grasp.
Creative disenchantment
“Taramandal” arrests creative disenchantment at different levels. For young Madhav it is not being part of the Beatles musical in school. Reba and Sanjeev thrive in picking up instances from life and enacting them. They merge the idea of the real and the imagined. Acting takes them to realms within themselves, hitherto unknown. So when Sanjeev leaves for Mumbai to dabble in acting, it is his creative chemistry with Reba that dies prematurely.Dushyant tells a familiar tale — of a theatre actor at heart steered to medicine to keep alive family tradition. “There was a genuine effort to convince me that we were the most advanced stage of the species. ‘Doctor man',” he announces to squeals of laughter.Lavanya, a wannabe actress, and Vicky the agent, give a convincing story of many aspiring actors in filmdom. Devika, the Omniphone model, never rises beyond the only contract she has.Amongst this profusion of stories, Patol lingers. He is sketched immaculately, but it is Andrew Hoffland who breathes life into him. He is superbly believable as someone who would listen to Mozart in the dark to fit into the character given to him. His starry gaze and his quiet equanimity even when he knows all he has to say is “Oh!” — all delicately bares Patol.The sets of a few portable boxes and planks work well in “Taramandal.” It evokes a quaint sense of the space, which anyway shifts rapidly. Actors work with military precision after each scene getting in the sets. At times residues and sets from the past scene lingers on giving a sense of the whole. The lights don't play truant either.But “Taramandal,” at close to two hours, suffers, as those part of it loved it too much to trim it. Silence is a potent weapon in a play; it does have a power that words often don't. But in “Taramandal”, silences have been pampered and stretched. Since all sub stories have a similar fate, editing out one, or pruning the tales wouldn't have tampered with the soul.

7,Return of 'Raktharakshas',Sangeeta,2010-05-06,16:17:41 IST,"A scene from the drama 'Raktarakshas'
  | Photo Credit: S.MAHINSHA Nothing seems to move the Malayali like nostalgia does. Song remixes and film remakes have had their due, and now its time for theatre re-runs.Pegging on the memories and emotions of a bygone era, Kalanilayam Drama Vision has re-opened its flagship production, ‘Raktharakshas.' The 30-year old play, directed by Kalanilayam's founder Krishnan Nair and written by Jagathy N. K. Achary, is currently running to full houses in Thiruvananthapuram.
Rooted storyline
The technical finesse and the rooted storyline plus the horror genre can be quoted as obvious reasons for the play's success. Besides there is its landmark invocatory song, ‘Salkaladevi than…,' which has attained a rather anthem-like status.The newer version of the play, which was re-designed to suit the ‘modern taste,' has been cut down to two hours and 40 minutes from the original four-hour duration. The soundtrack was reworked with advanced electronic systems and the scenes re-structured to incorporate dynamic visual effects.“I was aware that the nostalgia factor and the goodwill of the banner will bring in crowds. But Jagathy Sreekumar and I wanted to elevate the play into the contemporary cultural space; hence the efforts to makes changes in the aesthetics. We thus kept the basic storyline intact and re-worked on the external factors. And while incorporating the new additions, we saw to it that we did not go out of form,” says Anantha Padmanabhan, son of Kalanilayam Krishnan Nair.The drama company is currently managed jointly by Jagathy Sreekumar (son of Jagathy N. K. Achary) and Anantha Padmanabhan. The duo decided to revitalise the company in 2003. The original troupe was disbanded after the demise of Krishnan Nair.“We decided to go for a second run as we believed in theatre and its relevance in society. And the movement for us was not a tedious job, but a way of life,” asserts Ananthapadmanabhan, whose mother happens to be one of the oldest actors of Malayalam theatre.“My mother, Kodungallur Amminiyamma, had a close association with Kalanilayam, both as an actor and as the founder's support system. She had immense passion for acting. I remember her telling me about the physical strain she had while performing the play ‘Malabar Lahala.' She was nine months pregnant then. I have been fed and brought up on drama. The same goes for Sreekumar, I believe,” adds Anantha Padmanabhan, who is all set to helm the renaissance of Kalanilayam Drama Vision.The group, which has more than a hundred staff including actors, technicians and ground staff, swears by its manpower.“A play like ‘Raktharakshas' demands concentration, timing and consistency. The effects you see on stage are not computer generated. They are actually physically done by backstage hands. Without such talent and commitment, it wouldn't be possible for us to run the show,” he says.The cast of the ‘Raktharakshas' includes Kavitha in the lead, with Santosh, Sasi, Sukumaran, Thankachan and Sathyan in the supporting roles. The vibrant stage setting has been done by Jagannathan, a long term associate of Kalanilayam. The sound effects are by Jijo and the lighting by Ramchandran and Shijo.“Kalanilayam was once a wonderful treasure house of actors. Veterans such as Aravindaksha Menon were active members of the troupe. Their plays such as ‘Raktharakshas,' ‘Kayamkulam Kochunni,' ‘Elayidathu Rani,' ‘Taj Mahal' and so on banked heavily on actors. It would be great if this new troupe can groom and mould a new set of actors,” hopes R. S. Madhu, a theatre practitioner and a retired school headmaster.
Theatre in the mainstream
Kalanilayam's efforts in pushing theatre back into mainstream comes at the right juncture as the Malayali cultural space is more or less void with cinema entering a crisis and television nearing monotony. And theatre being the most vital form of self-expression, will find its way through in any cultural context.And the evidence? ‘Raktharakshas'; the play with its 30-year-old text and a very conventional stage form, has made it into the minds of the masses minds indicating the changing tastes and sensibilities. Also evident is the Malayali's open mindedness and receptivity towards any work of art done with seriousness and commitment.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Return-of-Raktharakshas/article16298745.ece
8,Endpaper: Tryst with the masters,PRADEEP SEBASTIAN,2010-05-06,19:09:34 IST,"Like everyone in the room I lusted after these books, but was too shy to caress or even touch them. They were beautiful, rare, uncommon. And very expensive. $500 for a book was cheap here. The average price of most of the books I was looking at was $15,000. Several were half a million. Like the fourth Shakespeare folio that beckoned from the window at the Peter Harrington booth. In the next booth was the other legendary antiquarian book seller from London, Bernard Quaritch. They were all here, 200 rare book dealers I had only heard or read about, from London, Paris, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Milan, New York, and San Francisco. They had brought with them the brightest copies of some of the rarest books in the world to show and sell at the 50th New York Antiquarian Book Fair.The fair, sponsored by the ABAA (Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America) is perhaps the most important rare book fair in the world. It takes place every year in April for four days at the Park Avenue Armory, a cavernous stone structure in the heart of Manhattan. For several years now the fair has been organised by Sanford L. Smith and Associates, ‘the foremost arts and antiques show management company'. I might have spent the rest of the fair just gawking at these books without touching them if it wasn't for Angel, a witty, erudite, vivacious young woman at the Bauman's Rare Books booth who simply threw open the closed glass shelves, encouraging me to handle them. She knew the provenance and bibliographical points of these editions intimately. She took out from the shelf a signed and inscribed copy of The Fountainhead, and handed it to me, noting that Ayn Rand had inscribed it to the architect who had helped her research the book. Price: $56,000.
Old friends
Soon, I was handling copies of first printings of books that I had once known only in text book form. In my hand, for instance, was a first edition, first issue of Keats' Endymion, 1818, Octavo, uncut, top edge gilt. A copy that possibly the poet himself may have once touched. A few minutes later, I was holding a signed, inscribed first edition of Forster's A Passage to India, Edward Arnold, 1924, Octavo, original half brown cloth, gray paper spine label. Oscar Wilde's Poems, 1892, signed. (Signed!). I put it back and picked up a copy of A Room of One's Own, Hogarth Press, 1929, limited issue. One of 492 copies signed by Virginia Woolf in her characteristic purple ink. Original cinnamon cloth. I exchanged that for a copy of The Wasteland, signed by Eliot.And just a little later, the book in my hand was the true first edition of Alice in Wonderland, the earliest known edition, preceding the first published London edition, 1866, beautifully rebound with 42 illustrations by John Tenniel. I realised, with a shiver, that I had just touched the very same copies that these authors had held in their hands. I stopped by at Imperial Fine Books to say hello to Bibi Mohammed, special for being one of the few South Asians in the antiquarian world and one of very few bookwomen in the trade. It was a particular treat to meet in person Allen and Patricia Ahearn of Quill and Brush, who put out the definitive book on modern collecting prices, and that renowned contemporary bookwoman, Priscilla Juvelis, specialising in Artists books.I was interested in modern first editions but there were so many dealers with so many bright copies of the high points of modern firsts, that they nearly became commonplace! Only at the New York fair! And most of the copies here were not only in mint condition, they were also signed. First printings of The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, The Hobbit, a whole run of Ian Fleming, Philip K. Dick, Pynchon, Wodehouse, all signed. Bright first issues of The Dharma Bums, Naked Lunch, Moby Dick, Dracula. Advance reading copies of the first Harry Potter book. Anywhere else, these copies would be considered hard to find, but here it was raining high points. At Biblioctopus you could browse through a complete set of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan, dust jackets intact and signed!I went looking for that holy grail of modern first editions: the true first edition of The Great Gatsby, in that scarcest of dust jackets. And found it, naturally, at Between the Covers Rare Books. It was nice to finally meet the folks at BTC, Tom Congalton and Dan Gregory, who put the book in my hands, and explained how this copy had all the points to make it the true first edition. The price? $175, 000. BTC also possessed one of the highlights of the fair: an inscribed first issue of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises in that very, very scarce dustjacket. I was also in search of my own personal holy grail among modern firsts: a signed first edition of The Catcher in the Rye, but no one seemed to possess the grail.However, Ken Lopez Bookseller, another legendary book dealer in modern firsts, sharing the booth with BTC, had, what was at least for me, the next best thing: the first state printing of Salinger's Raise High The Roofbeam Carpenters in the hard to find edition lacking the dedication page. Only 20 or so copies of this state are known to exist in the market. I opened it, saw it lacked the dedication myself, and handed it back, feeling very privileged. In fact, every moment at the fair was a privilege; a bibliographical shock. Peter Harrington had a Shakespeare folio, something I had only seen pictured in catalogues before. And no one seemed to mind when I cautiously took it out of the glass bookcase and carefully, very carefully, turned the pages.
Aesthetic surfeit
By the time I had done just one round of the booths, I had handled books that few people ever see, much less touch: a copy of Origin of Species that Darwin had held, a copy of the New Testament that Martin Luther had used, an illuminated Book of Hours from 1455, incunabula (early printed books before movable type), antique maps, a complete set of Winnie the Pooh, signed by A.A. Milne, original Pooh drawings of E.H. Shephard, the very scare privately printed copy of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit (80, 000 pounds), the very scarce first printing of Don Quixote, the Olympia editions of Lolita, first editions of Kierkegaard's Either/Or and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, signed sets of Kipling, Jane Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Flaubert, Sylvia Plath, and issues of the Strandmagazine in which the Sherlock Holmes stories had first appeared.It was enough to make any bibliophile swoon. I decided to leave before I actually fainted from so much aesthetic shock and ecstatic bookishness. But I was going to return of course, with two more days of the fair, I couldn't resist. As I walked out, I looked at what I had bought: several lavish and beautifully illustrated book catalogues. It was all I could afford at the New York Antiquarian Book Fair.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/pradeep_sebastian/Endpaper-Tryst-with-the-masters/article16123614.ece

Clement earned his place over Colombian Alejandro Falla 6-4, 6-3.Federer was quietly satisfied with removing the demons, which stalked him after his Rome loss.“This win was not always beautiful but it doesn’t matter. I’m sure my best tennis is not far away. I have a bit of a breather now and I’m looking forward to Friday.“I’m happy that I came through the first round, it was nice to win. Today was a matter of coming through tough situations. I played well when I was down 0-40 and serving for the first set.“There is always pressure in the first match, it doesn’t matter who it’s against.

11,People welcome verdict with firecrackers,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,23:29:37 IST,"Mumbai citizens burst firecrackers, distributed sweets and relived memories of the November 26, 2008 massacre as soon as they heard the order on Thursday of the Special Sessions Court sentencing Kasab to death by hanging. Crackers went off in South Mumbai in the predominantly Muslim areas of the city, and people carried placards welcoming the verdict. Various groups came out on the street with banners and posters, passing sweets around.At Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), where Kasab and Abu Ismail wreaked havoc, crackers were burst to welcome the verdict. People queued up to pay homage at the memorial to victims. Right from 10-year-old Devika Rotawan, who was a witness, to Kavita Karkare, wife of the killed police officer Hemant Karkare, families of victims and survivors have been demanding death for Kasab for that night of horror which claimed 166 lives.For Assistant Police Inspector Hemant Bowdhankar, this was the day he was waiting for ever since he helped in the capture of Kasab. Mr. Bowdhankar was part of the police team from D B Marg police station which stopped Kasab and Abu Ismail at Chowpatty as they drove up in a stolen silver Skoda on the night of November 26, and engaged them in a short gun battle.The Mumbai police will always remember the sacrifice of policeman Tukaram Ombale who fell to Kasab's bullets that night. The death sentence has vindicated somewhat his sacrifice, feel the policemen. Mr. Bowdhankar told TheHindu: “I was expecting the maximum punishment for Kasab. Everyone did a good job of giving evidence and the truth was what made the difference. We all welcome this judgment.”Another policeman, who was part of this team and who does not wish to be named, says that this is a judgment that should make all Indians proud. It was the result of teamwork of the Mumbai police, and the Indian judiciary showed the world how it could conduct a fair trial. This is a moment to feel proud of our judiciary as well, he said.However, Ms. Karkare, while welcoming the death sentence, was disappointed that two persons were acquitted in this case. Kasab should not be given an opportunity to go to the Supreme Court and his sentence should be executed immediately, she added.Vaishali Ombale, daughter of Tukaram Ombale, expressed fears that the punishment would be delayed. She, like many other families of victims, called for a speedy end to the whole thing.
“Fit punishment”
Vishnu Zende, the announcer at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) who repeatedly made announcements asking people to clear the station that night, was happy. “I saw what Kasab did that day at CST and this is a fit punishment. Nothing less would have done. We are all very happy to hear this verdict,” he said.The government too welcomed the death sentence for Kasab. Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal and State Home Minister R.R. Patil praised the judiciary and Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, and said there must be no delay in executing Kasab's death sentence.Mr. Chavan said the verdict reflected the public sentiment. The trial was fair and democratic and ended within a year. He complimented judge M.L. Tahaliyani and also senior police officials, Rakesh Maria, Deven Bharati and the Mumbai police for the way in which they handled this case.Mr. Patil said India was a soft target for terrorists and this judgment should send a strong signal to the world that terrorism would not be tolerated. Considering the gravity of charges against Kasab, that of waging war against India and murder, it could be nothing less than the death sentence. Given the brutality of the attack, the punishment seemed less, he said.Mr. Patil once again said that all those convicted who were in Pakistan must be brought to India and the world community must bring pressure on Pakistan to do so. Responding to newspaper reports that the State had no hangman, Mr. Patil said the government would find one.He said the government would appeal to the Centre to fast track the legal procedure so that there was no delay in executing the sentence. In regard to the acquittal of the two Indians in the case, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, Mr. Patil said the government would file an appeal against it in the High Court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/People-welcome-verdict-with-firecrackers/article13637475.ece

14,India among the worst 10 climate polluters: study,IANS,2010-05-06,10:39:52 IST,"A man rows his makeshift raft in the polluted Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad. File photo: AP.
  India figures among the world’s worst 10 countries causing environmental damage, according to a new study which lists Brazil as the most polluting country.The research led by professor Corey Bradshaw, of the University of Adelaide’s environment institute, has placed India at seventh position while ranking the US and China as the largest carbon producers after Brazil.The 10 countries with the worst global footprint were Brazil, the US, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru, it said.Countries were measured on a range of indicators, including fertiliser use, natural forest loss, habitat conservation, fisheries and other marine captures, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat.The study, published in the science journal PLoS ONE on Wednesday, found Australia’s carbon emissions, rate of species threat and natural forest loss were the greatest contributors to its ninth—place ranking, according to The Age.“If you’re clearing a lot of forests, you tend to also to overharvest in the ocean and use a lot of fertilizers,” Prof. Bradshaw said explaining the link between development and environmental damage.He said finding the US and China in the top 10 were not surprising, though he was surprised that a relatively poor country such as Brazil took out the top spot.“The wealthier you are, the more damage you do, on average,” he said. “It’s just a function of human nature. Growth is the be—all and end—all for all economies around the world, and if you’re not growing economically, you’re stagnant, and therefore that’s a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that’s unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Prof. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Prof. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Prf. Bradshaw said the better—ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven’t wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we’d consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/India-among-the-worst-10-climate-polluters-study/article16298674.ece
15,U.S. tightens no-fly rule after Shahzad’s near escape,PTI,2010-05-06,10:38:36 IST,"After Times Square bombing plot suspect Faisal Shahzad managed to pass through several layers of security at the New York airport to board a Dubai-bound flight, only to be stopped minutes before take off, the U.S. has tightened its no-fly rules for airlines.The new rules, enforced yesterday by the Transportation and Security Administration, came within two days of Shahzad’s fleeing attempt.The Pakistan-born U.S. national boarded a Emirates flight, even though his name was added to the no-fly list of the United States on Monday.Under the new regulation, airlines now have to check the government’s no-fly list within two hours, which was earlier 24 hours, after they are notified that a name has been added.“It’s being done because a review of the situation finds that an airline is required every 24 hours to check the no-fly list. The suspect’s name was entered a little after noon, I believe, on Monday, therefore, though on the no-fly list, the airline didn’t have to check necessarily at that point,” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said at his daily news briefing.“The new rules require that to happen at a two-hour interval if airlines are notified that somebody’s been added as a risk to the no-fly list,” he said, adding the reason there were redundancies in the system to ensure that there are many mechanisms that would allow one to prevent somebody from flying, which is what happened in this case.“The CBP (Custom and Border Patrol) takes a locked manifest, that’s required to be filed 30 minutes before a flight, with people that are on the plane. That was checked against that list and the individual was removed from the plane,” Gibbs said.Shahzad nearly escaped arrest with only around 20 minutes left for take-off and planes gates closed but the tide turned later - the gates were reopened and he was arrested.The Pakistani-American was placed on the expedited no-fly list Monday at 12:30 afternoon.Seven hours later at about 7:30 pm, he was able to purchase a one-way ticket to Pakistan all by cash. The flight was scheduled to leave at 11:45 pm.“In his case, the airline seemingly didn’t check the name, and the suspect was allowed to purchase a ticket and obtain a boarding pass,” a senior administration official told The Washington Post.“Under the new measure, the airline would be required to re-check the list within two hours of being notified of a special circumstance expedited no-fly name,” the official was said as quoting by the daily.However, Emirates Airlines in a statement said it “fully cooperated with and responded immediately to all local and federal authorities on all matters” related to the flight in question.The airlines also said it is fully compliant with all US passenger check-in procedures and works closely with the US government “to update security watch lists on a regular and timely basis.”Meanwhile, a group of Democratic Senators urged the US President Barack Obama to issue an executive order that all airlines would automatically have to alert the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) if a passenger seeks to buy an airline ticket with cash.Senators Benjamin L Cardin, Charles E Schumer and Mark Udall said the new policy would bolster airline security until the end of the year, when airlines’ responsibility for checking passenger manifests against the no-fly list is scheduled to shift entirely to the TSA.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/U.S.-tightens-no-fly-rule-after-Shahzadrsquos-near-escape/article16298678.ece

Do it in a phased manner. To say we don't have funds and we can't do it is not the answer. What could be a greater need than protecting human lives? You need Government of India funds and till then you can't set up shelters? How can the Chief Secretary say like this in an affidavit? Do you know how your State will be painted in the eyes of the world?”The Bench said: “I am sure the Chief Minister has not seen the affidavit. Otherwise, this type of affidavit will not be filed. The entire country is on one side and you are on the other. You file a better affidavit after it is vetted by the Chief Minister.”The Bench, in its brief order, lauded the steps taken by Andhra Pradesh and Delhi for formulating a comprehensive scheme for providing shelter to the homeless.

  | Photo Credit: Damian Dovarganes Google Monday snapped up a top Canadian startup which pioneered a 3D interface technology for Mac and Windows PCs.Called Canada's hottest software startup, Toronto-based BumpTop has been acquired by the search engine for reportedly between $30 and $45 million, according to reports. However, there were no details of the deal by the two sides.Set up just three years ago, BumpTop has pioneered touch-screen software that allows use of multiple fingers at a time on a multiple touch screen.Called ‘desktop workspace,’ the software allows users to organise pictures, documents and videos much more intuitively. Users can perform many functions with their fingers, including dragging of items into docks, and playing around with photos on desktop.Though Google has not specified how its will use this pioneering technology, it is certain that it will use touch-screen software in its smart phones based on its Android operating system.Since its Android operating system is basically geared for touch-screen technology, rather than keyboard technology, Google's mobile market strategy is aimed at taking on Apple's iPhone and iPad that use touch screen technology.The acquired Toronto company will no longer sell its software independently after May 7.In a statement on its website Monday, it said, “Today, we have a big announcement to make: we're excited to announce that we’ve been acquired by Google! This means that BumpTop (for both Windows and Mac) will no longer be available for sale. Additionally, no updates to the products are planned.”The acquisition of BumpTop is the fifth such deal by the Mountain View-based Google within a month as part of its strategy to take on Apple.Just last week, it had acquired Labpixies that develops social games for mobile services and Facebook.

The device was expected to be lowered down later on Thursday to the seabed some 5,000 feet below the surface to allow the crude spilling from the well to be pumped into a nearby tanker ship, according to energy giant BP.

Ahead of Apple's iPad coming on the block analysts predicted pain for Amazon.“We're quite comfortable having a diverse range of physical retailers, whereas most of the other players would like to have a less competitive space, because they'd like to dominate,'' said a Google official.Google confirmed to the BBC that Google Editions would not be affected by the firm's present legal troubles over trying to digitise millions of out-of-print books.“Plans for Google Editions will happen independent of whatever the settlement agreement is,'' said a Google's official.The search giant's efforts to create the world's biggest digital library have been mired in legal action for the last couple of years.Critics have long claimed Google's deal with U.S. publishers and authors would give them a monopoly over online book sales.Google said it would make “millions of books searchable via the web''A ruling on the issue is due soon. — © BBC News/Distributed by the New York Times Syndicate",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Google-enters-digital-book-war/article16298858.ece

This can be easily crossed especially in case the Kurdish parties, strong in northern Iraq, support the merger.Analysts say consolidation of these factions is a victory for Iran which is highly influential among the Shia formations in Iraq.The Iraqi National Movement or Iraqiyah, headed by former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, slammed the formation of the new Shia coalition as a move to isolate his party. The Iraqiyah party had won 91 seats, the highest among any single formation which contested the March 7 elections.Apart from achieving a simple majority, the Shia bloc has to cross two remaining hurdles. First, it has to agree on its choice of a new Prime Minister. Observers say that the chances of Mr. Maliki getting a second term are slim because of the stiff opposition to his name by the 40-seats strong group led by Shia cleric Moqtada Al Sadr. The former Prime Minister, Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, Adil Abdul Mahdi, currently Vice-President, and Baqir Jabr are the other heavyweight contenders for the post.Second, the Shia parties are debating the incorporation of the Iraqiyah formation, which has wide support among the large Sunni minority, in a new national unity government. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, headed by Ammar al-Hakim, which is part of the new Shia super-coalition, has been insisting on the inclusion of “other national forces” in the new government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Iraqs-major-Shia-blocs-to-merge/article16298855.ece

Mr. Haq also submitted Law Secretary Aqil Mirza's official response to the apex court.He said the Law Secretary had made it clear that the cases in Switzerland were over and there was no need for any communication to reopen them.The Law Secretary had also made it clear that the cases against Mr. Zardari cannot be reopened, Mr. Haq said. The Supreme Court bench expressed its dissatisfaction with the government's stand.Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk, a member of the bench, said the government seemed to be attaching no importance to the court's verdict striking down the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) issued by the former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf.The bench asked the Attorney-General to name the person who was impeding the implementation of the court's verdict so that the bench could take action against him.The Attorney-General replied that the government's intentions were honourable and proper procedures were being adopted to implement the verdict.On March 31, the chief of National Accountability Bureau (NAB), country's top anti-graft agency, had told a seven-member bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry that authorities had written letters to Swiss officials to reopen the corruption cases against Mr. Zardari.The NRO, which was issued by General Musharraf as part of a secret understanding with the former Premier, Benazir Bhutto, was struck down by the apex court last year.Tensions between Zardari's PPP-led government and Chief Justice Iftikhar M Chaudhry have increased since the apex court began pressuring authorities to implement its order to reopen graft cases against Mr. Zardari and his close aides.Senior PPP leaders have insisted that the President enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Zardaris-graft-cases-closed-court-told/article16298854.ece

  Millions of undecided voters held the fate of Britain's political leaders on Thursday as polling was held for the most closely-contested general election in a generation with opinion polls pointing to a hung Parliament while giving the Tories sufficient edge to be able to form a minority government.Tory chief David Cameron, accompanied by his heavily-pregnant wife Samantha, was the first of the three main party leaders to vote and the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg the last. His wife, Miriam, accompanied him to the polling station but was not able to vote because she is a Spanish national.On what could be his last day as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown looked remarkably cheerful as he briskly walked into the polling booth with his wife Sarah and warmly greeted journalists and party supporters gathered outside. After a gruelling campaign, all three leaders travelled to their constituencies to cast their votes.Mr. Brown ended his campaign with an emotional appeal to disenchanted Labour voters to “come home'', while his two rivals called for “change'' after 13 years of Labour rule with Mr. Cameron urging voters not to let “fear triumph over hope'' and Mr. Clegg saying people had an opportunity to ‘change Britain forever''.With as many as 40 per cent of voters said to be undecided all parties were able to claim that there was still everything to play for. The tension was, especially, palpable in the 100-odd key marginal seats where a swing of a few hundred votes could make the difference.Tories, in particular, invested heavily in Labour marginals, some held by leading Labour figures, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Ed Balls, Schools Secretary and one of Mr. Brown's close confidants.
Late surge
Labour claimed a late surge of support among women voters in marginal constituencies saying the election would be decided “around kitchen tables and in living rooms''. Lib Dems' hopes of snatching a number of marginal Labour and Tory seats appeared to fade after failing to sustain the momentum they had gained on the back of Mr. Clegg's barnstorming performance during the leaders' television debates.Polling would close at 10 p.m. (local time) and first results are expected around midnight though a clear picture is not likely to emerge until late Friday morning.No official figures for voter turnout were available at the time of going to the press.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/U.K.-elections-on-a-knife-edge/article16298851.ece

We have consistently shared our concerns with the US on supply of military equipments to Pakistan by it.“We have always drawn the U.S.’ attention and cautioned it about our past experience which shows that it has always been used against us.

Photo: AP.
  Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a tough test on Sunday, when almost a quarter of Germans go to the polls after this week’s decision to bail Greece out with billions of euros of government—backed loans.On May 9, voters in North Rhine—Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, will be asking how to fill the gaping holes in city budgets as they elect a new regional parliament — while Greece stands to benefit from Germany’s perceived generosity.The majority of Germans oppose the Greek bailout, of which Merkel has pledged the lion’s share, fuelled by a media campaign portraying Greeks as corrupt, lazy and undeserving of German aid.Eight months into Ms. Merkel’s second term, the vote is also a key hurdle for the coalition between her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP), whose popularity has plummeted during their time in office.North Rhine—Westphalia’s 13.5 million voters have frequently set the future course for German federal politics.If the state’s current CDU—FDP government is ousted on Sunday, it would cost Ms. Merkel her slender coalition majority in the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house of parliament representing the federal states, making it tougher to push through promised economic liberalization.Opinion polls show no clear favourites in North Rhine—Westphalia, traditionally a Social Democrat (SPD) stronghold, after an election campaign dominated by such issues as school reform and financial shortages.The reputation of state premier Juergen Ruettgers, of Ms. Merkel’s CDU, was tarnished by a funding scandal when it emerged earlier this year that a party official was offering private meetings with him in return for cash.His main challenger, the SPD’s Hannelore Kraft, is little—known beyond North Rhine—Westphalia, where the 48—year—old hopes to become the state’s first female premier after a rapid rise within her party.Greece’s request last month for a eurozone and International Monetary Fund bailout could not have come at a worse time for Ms. Merkel, who has been widely accused of trying to put off the unpopular decision until after the North Rhine—Westphalia election.The chancellor has since been at pains to convince voters that a Greek bailout was the best move for Germany. After cabinet gave the go—ahead on Monday, Ms. Merkel hurriedly convened a press conference and gave a series of television interviews.“A stable European currency has an incredibly high value,”the chancellor said, justifying the rescue package with the “emergency situation“that Greece found itself in.Asked on television whether she feared a voter backlash at the weekend, Ms. Merkel insisted the real question was whether the government had done everything to save the stability of the euro and protect German interests.“I think this question can be answered with a clear ‘yes’ — and I think the people know that,”the chancellor added.If Ms. Merkel does not receive the hoped—for backing at the polls, this could set a worrying signal, in a state seen as a bell—weather for German federal politics.In 2005, Ruettgers led the CDU back to power for the first time there in 39 years, forming a coalition with the FDP which was a forerunner of the coalition at federal level last year.According to opinion polls, the governing coalition is neck—and— neck with the alternative pairing of Social Democrats and Greens, who governed North Rhine—Westphalia until their national government fell out of favour with voters.However, neither the CDU—FDP nor SPD—Greens looks likely to win the necessary majority to govern. One alternative could be a CDU coalition with the Greens, testing the waters for a possible replication at federal level.Alternatively, the SPD and Greens could bring the radical Left Party into the fold — a move seen by many as a political taboo, due to the Left’s roots in the former East German communist state party.The SPD’s Kraft has repeatedly insisted that the Left Party is “neither able to form a coalition, nor to govern” — although they consistently poll above the five—per—cent hurdle required for parliamentary representation.Sunday will also be a vote of confidence for Ms. Merkel’s coalition partner, FDP leader Guido Westerwelle. His popularity has plummeted since he came into power, and the tax cuts at the core of the party’s manifesto are threatened by financial shortfalls.The state premier, Ruettgers, was the first prominent member of the government coalition to suggest that the Greek bailout could have =an additional knock—on effect on proposed tax cuts in Germany.On Thursday, the government publishes its detailed estimate of tax income, giving a clear picture of the country’s financial health.In North Rhine—Westphalia, where councils are struggling with huge debts, this is likely to fuel further questions ahead of Sunday’s election about the billions flowing to Greece.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lsquoGreece-bailout-casts-shadow-over-key-German-electionrsquo/article16298671.ece

Segun Adeniyi, chief press secretary to Yar’Adua, confirmed that the President died about 9 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Wednesday in Abuja.Mr. Yar’Adua, 58, had been suffering from a heart ailment since November, which necessitated his seeking treatment in Saudi Arabia and Vice President Goodluck Jonathan assuming office as acting president.A former governor of the northern state of Katsina, Mr. Yar’Adua was elected president in 2007 following controversial general elections.His term was dominated by speculations over his health, as he has suffered a chronic kidney condition for at least 10 years.In the last three years, Mr. Yar’Adua has twice been flown to Germany for emergency treatment and visited hospitals in Saudi Arabia.In February, Mr. Jonathan became acting president following Mr. Yar’Adua’s three-month absence as a result of pericarditis, an inflammation of the lining of the heart.Mr. Jonathan, 52, was elevated from vice-president on February 9 by the Nigerian National Assembly in Yar’Adua’s absence.Yar’Adua, 58, had not been seen in public since November, when he went to a Saudi hospital for treatment of the heart. He departed without invoking constitutional measures to temporarily hand over power, leaving Nigeria with a political and legal vacuum.After both chambers of the legislature voted to install Mr. Jonathan as acting president, Mr. Yar’Adua returned to Nigeria and reoccupied the presidential palace but remained out of sight.Mr. Yar’Adua was a Muslim from northern Nigeria, while Mr. Jonathan is a Christian from southern Nigeria.In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences for the death of Mr. Yar’Adua, in a White House statement.“We remember and honour President Yar’Adua’s profound personal decency and integrity, his deep commitment to public service, and his passionate belief in the vast potential and bright future of Nigeria’s 150 million people,” Mr. Obama said.He praised Mr. Yar’Adua’s work “to promote peace and stability in Africa through his support of Nigerian peacekeeping efforts as well as his strong criticism of undemocratic actions in the region. He was committed to creating lasting peace and prosperity within Nigeria’s own borders, and continuing that work will be an important part of honouring his legacy.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Nigerian-President-YarrsquoAdua-passes-away-after-long-illness/article16298747.ece

It also plans to have sub-categories for various users such as business users, foreigners and have posts State and region-wise.It all began with the DoP posting information about new schemes for users. It posted links to its website telling users how they could calculate postage tariffs or know pin codes of their respective areas. Then recently, the DoP launched SMS tracking facility for Speed Post shipments and told people how they could make use of it.Similarly, through Twitter, the DoP has already started an awareness campaign for India's biggest-ever stamp show that will be held in Delhi next February. It has also been sending messages to people who want to partner DoP in various projects or apply for some tender. Followers have also been making complaints and giving feedback about how to improve the functioning of the department.DoP's Twitter page is also proving to be a boon for those who pursue philately as a hobby, as it has been informing people about limited edition stamps that India Post issues from time to time. “Welcome to the amazing world of the great magician P.C.

  | Photo Credit: Pat Wellenbach It may look like a piece of gel but it’s a new nano-based telecom technology “enabler” that can make computers and the internet hundreds of times faster.The technology, that may be in use only five or 10 years in the future, is being designed by Koby Scheuer of Tel Aviv University's (TAU) School of Electrical Engineering.Mr. Scheuer has developed a new plastic-based technology for the nano-photonics market, which manufactures optical devices and components. His plastic-based “filter” is made from nanometre (a billionth of a metre) sized grooves embedded into the plastic.When used in fibre optics cable switches, this new device will make our communication devices smaller, more flexible and more powerful, he says.“Once Americans have a fibre optics cable coming into every home, all communication will go through it - telephone, cable TV, the Internet,” adds Mr. Scheuer.“But to avoid bottlenecks of information, we need to separate the information coming through into different channels. Our polymeric devices can do that in the optical domain - at a speed, quality and cost that the semi-conductor industry can't even imagine,” Mr. Scheuer says.In the next decade, fibre optic cables that now run from city to city will feed directly into every individual home. When that technology comes to light, the new plastic-based switches could revolutionise the way we communicate.“Right now, we could transmit all of the written text of the world though a single fibre in a fibre optics cable in just a few seconds,” says Mr. Scheuer.“But in order to handle these massive amounts of communication data, we need filters to make sense of the incoming information. Ours uses a plastic-based switch, replacing hard-to-fabricate and expensive semi-conductors.”Semi-conductors, grown on crystals in sterile labs and processed in special ovens, take days and sometimes months to manufacture. They are delicate and inflexible as well, Mr. Scheuer explains.“Our plastic polymer switches come in an easy-to-work-with liquid solution. Using a method called ‘tamping,’ almost any lab can make optical devices out of the silicon rubber mould we've developed.”His biggest hurdle, says Mr. Scheuer, is in convincing the communications industry that polymers are stable materials.“There is a lot of prejudice in this industry against plastics. But this approach could take us to a new level of communication,” the researcher says, according to a TAU release.He also notes that the process is not much different from the way that mass numbers of DVDs are produced in a factory - except Mr. Scheuer works on a nano, not a “giant” micro, scale.His device can also be used in the gyros of planes, ships and rockets; inserted into cell phones; and made a part of flexible virtual reality gloves so doctors could “operate” on computer networks over large distances.These findings were published in Optics Express.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/New-fibre-optics-technology-to-speed-up-internet/article16298792.ece

38,Nagin (1954),Vijay Lokapally,2010-05-06,17:05:26 IST,"It used to be one of the favourite pastimes of the summer vacations. The kids would wait for the snake charmer to arrive and play his mesmerising flute, gradually lifting the cover of his basket to unveil a lethal reptile, its hood greeting the motley gathering to a session of music and dance.As the flute's captivating notes came wafting through, the children would gather under the tree, the girls instantly transformed into intrepid ballerinas, the snake happily forgotten…The kids, swaying to the flute, held centre stage, and only when the reptile hissed angrily would the snake charmer dismiss the enthusiastic young group. The music, and not the snake, remained etched in memory.
Charming tune
It was only many summers later that one learnt the tune was not his original work. It came from a movie called “Nagin.” The tune, created by Hemant Kumar, became the theme for all snake charmers. The man playing the charming been (flute) in Hemant Da's orchestra was Kalyanji, who later joined hands with Anandji to form a highly successful team of composers. You could hear this immortal composition across the country.It is said that when “Nagin” was released, snake charmers entertained the crowd outside the cinema halls during the intermission. It is also said that some theatre owners would engage these snake charmers to keep an eye just in case the tune from inside the hall ‘attracted' a reptile in the neighbourhood.One had heard of a movie hall in Hyderabad being host to an unwelcome ‘guest' during the screening of “Nagin.”
Strength of music
Coming to the storyline, there is nothing exceptional about “Nagin”. Mala (Vyjayanthimala) and Sanatan (Pradeep Kumar) belong to warring tribes and fall in love when she is entranced by his been. The movie progresses on the strength of its music as the two lovers, confronting opposition in various forms, are separated before uniting in a climax that includes five songs in a row.The closing segment of the movie is shot in colour, but it is the black-and-white portion that stands out for Hemant Da's music and Vyjayanthimala's performance.The ethereal Vyjayanthimala, barely 18, illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty, moving around daintily from one song to the other; from the bewitching “Man Dole Mera Tan Dole” to the poignant “Mera Dil Ye Pukare Aaja…” Of course, the soul of the movie remains Lata Mangeshkar's voice and Hemant Da's unforgettable composition to some impeccable lyrics by Rajinder Krishan. Simply unmatched…There are only a few movies that can be counted for their musical score, and “Nagin” remains one of them. When Lata sings “Jadugar Sainyya Chhodo Mori Bainyya” and Vyjayanthimala responds with her dancing skills, the result is sheer magic on the screen. The close-up shots of Vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effort.“Nagin” was a precursor to her rise in Hindi cinema as an iconic actor, who combined her talents, performing and dancing, to rule the screen on her terms.There are a couple of nondescript numbers too, ironically sung by Lata, but tolerable compared to some mediocre stuff that symbolises music today.Hemant Da's contribution to the movie is monumental. He gets the best out of Lata and then lends his voice to an unforgettable duet “Arre Chhod De Sajaniya Chhod De Patang Meri Chhod De”, apart from the solos that have stood the test of time: “Tere Dwaar Khada Ek Jogi”; “Yaad Rakhna Pyaar Ki Nishani Gori Yaad Rakhna” and “Zindagi Ke Dene Wale Zindagi Ke Lene Wale…”The two biggest recall values of “Nagin” are Vyjayanthimala and Hemant Da. The director is Nandlal Jashwantlal; there is a cameo by I.S. Johar; the villain is Jeevan and the hero is Pradeep Kumar; it was a huge hit and fittingly fetched Hemant Da the Filmfare Award. In small towns, it was common to see a man guarding snake baskets outside the theatre screening “Nagin”, for the charmers would all be inside. A pity the snake charmer has vanished in these times, but the charm of “Nagin” has only grown….",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Nagin-1954/article16298764.ece
39,Obsession with marriage,ANUJ KUMAR,2010-05-06,16:58:35 IST,"Director Gurinder Chadha
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr gurinder new Most of the times we find Hindi film heroines are presented as the epitome of beauty. Gurinder Chadha tinkers with this deep-rooted stereotype, which has social ramifications, in “It's A Wonderful Afterlife”, a Chadha comedy releasing this Friday. If the title gives a backhand compliment to Frank Capra's classic, Chadha says the form flirts with the Ealing comedies, the lightly satirical films which depicted British society in the post World War II period. “I have also put an element of ghost. Horror-comedies are common in Britain, but Indian audience have not experienced the genre. Also, in British films we hardly find British Indian characters. I felt the need for both, and we have a ‘masala' film, which has comedy, ghosts, tragedy and reincarnation with a social comment underneath,” says Chadha, who established herself as the voice of the Diaspora with films like “Bhaji On The Beach” and “Bend It Like Beckham”.
Indian obsession
At the heart of the story is the Indian obsession with marriage dealt with in a light-hearted fashion. “Mrs. Sethi is a typical Punjabi woman that we see on the road but hardly ever try to delve into the story of such fat dames. She has a well-rounded daughter, who is not beautiful in the traditional sense. Frustrated after her repeated attempts to get her married, Sethi kills the people who refused her. Interestingly, the ghosts of four such people help her out in finding a groom for her daughter in return for reincarnation.” She says the thought of reincarnation by doing a good deed lends a moral fibre to the film and therein lies the link with Capra's “It's A Beautiful Life”.Chadha assures us she hasn't fallen for the typical solutions that the girl loses weight in the second half and turns into a swan. “Here the character Roopi is ultimately accepted as she is…only her dress sense changes a bit. The filmmakers need to understand that we have a lot of well-rounded women around and they make perfect brides and mothers. In India you will find such ladies in almost every household. The filmy representation is responsible for creating unnecessary pressure on girls to be skinny leading to an unhealthy lifestyle.”Shabana Azmi plays Mrs. Sethi and Chadha says the actress didn't read the script before accepting the offer. “Like many, I also had a serious image of her in my mind but when I met her with Javed Akhtar during the shooting of ‘Bride and Prejudice', I saw the lighter side of her. There I made up my mind to offer her a central role in one of my films. Mrs. Sethi is a complex character. It is not one of those roles where she had to look inside. On one hand it is over the top, as she is interacting with ghosts, which only she could see, all the time, and on the other, there is a tragic underpinning to her character. Only she could have made it look authentic. Those who have seen the film in Britain have called it an Indian Bridget Jones.”Chadha says this time it was different for Shabana, known for her intense preparation for a role. “She didn't know my kind of humour. It was only when she landed in London that she got an idea. I made her watch some Ealing comedies and then she got the hang of things. She observed the gait, walk and accent of Punjabi women in South Hall and incorporated it so well into the character that when curious people trooped in on the sets looking for Shabanaji, they were unable to identify her.”The film also marks Chadha's association with an Indian production house, Studio 18. There is a growing acceptance for her kind of cinema where culture is used as a tool to transcend boundaries. “Coming from a mixed parentage, growing up in London and married to a Japanese American, I understand the problems of the Diaspora better than many others. British people might not identify with the Indian obsession with marriage, but Italians, South Africans and Chinese would. This has happened with most of my films. People have been able to identify with the characters despite cultural barriers on the surface.” Chadha says during her growing up years she missed Asian characters on television and films. “So when I got an opportunity, I attempted to make them mainstream.” Now when she has succeeded, she wants to have fun with it.
Hindi version
The Hindi version of the film is called “Hai Marjawaan”, but if the past is a parameter, the chances don't look too bright as the dubbed version of “Bride And Prejudice” didn't find many takers. “‘Bride And Prejudice' was not essentially made for a Hindi film audience. It was a way to introduce American audiences to Bollywood song and dance and it achieved that goal. I have seen young American girls still dancing to songs of the film in Bollywood night parties. “Hai Marjawaan” is very much my film. It has much more to appeal to the Indian audience, as apart from the theme the comic lines and gags have an Indian touch.”Chadha is now working on a children's film set in Kerala with lots of elephants around. “I believe kids' films have lost their innocence. These days I find them a lot more knowing. Perhaps producers want to reach out to the entire family. The kids of today are much more exposed to the media and perhaps they get the inherent meaning, but do they need to? I want to make it just for kids. Then there is a film on the Indian Freedom Movement from a British Indian perspective.” Is she ready to rub some Indians the wrong way? “Well, every good film does that. Otherwise filmmaking will become a very bland process. It is still early days, but the film in a way represents my life. My grandparents suffered while shifting from India and I have carried that pain somewhere inside.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Obsession-with-marriage/article16299076.ece

  | Photo Credit: 07dfr antaheen The unsung hill State of Nagaland with its recently concluded Indian Panorama Film Festival is all set to become the precursor of things to come. Emboldened with the success of the first ever film festival in Nagaland, the Directorate of Film Festivals is ready to take the concept to other remote States, including those not traditionally known for either their film industry or hosting such fetes. States like Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, not quite known for their cinema, are likely to host similar events later this year.Speaking to The Hindu at the conclusion of the Nagaland fest, S.M. Khan, director, DFF, said, “We want to take the Indian Panorama Film Festival and also National Award-winning films to all parts of the country. We want people who do not have access to quality cinema to have a firsthand experience of acclaimed films in different Indian languages. For the first time we are also going to screen National Award-winning films in various State capitals. Earlier such films could be seen only in Delhi.”
Local content
After Kohima, the next festival is coming up in Shimla from May 28. Like the North East venture, it too shall have around 15 offerings with a mix of feature and non-features films. “In Shimla, we also plan to screen a Punjabi film, if possible. In fact, wherever we host the festival, we will make sure that local sentiment is respected and at least some of the films are in either the local language or they have content that local people can identify with,” Khan said.Unlike Kohima where stars were conspicuous by their absence, Shimla will keep its date with them during the three-day fest. Rahul Bose, Divya Dutta, Abhishek Pathak and Sivan are likely to attend. Among the films to be screened are “Haat: The Weekly Bazaar”, “Harishchandrachi Factory”, “Boond”, “Keshu” and “Antaheen” — the last one having already been shown in Kohima.After Shimla, the film caravan shall roll into Bhopal in July this year. Meanwhile, plans are afoot to take the festival down South, beginning with a three-day venture in Kerala's capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The summer of many challenges and cine feast continues with another possible edition in either Hyderabad or Chennai.“This is probably for the first time in its history that DFF is hosting film festivals across the country. We don't want that the cinema viewing experience should be available to only a handful in metropolises. We want to make it a universal phenomenon. That is why even beyond the Panorama festivals, we are all geared up to have retrospectives of Kamal Haasan and Ang Lee in July this year.” Incidentally, Kamal Haasan was scheduled to have a retrospective in Goa last year. It could not be held during IFFI as it was felt he deserved more than concurrent shows with other luminaries.All the Panorama festivals will conclude well before the International Film Festival of India kisses the coastal State of Goa in November this year.The show goes on.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/The-show-moves-on%E2%80%A6/article16298761.ece
41,Hero of the common man,Saraswathy Nagarajan,2010-05-06,16:30:17 IST,"Film Director Sathyan Anthikkad. Photo: C. Ratheesh Kumar
  | Photo Credit: C.RATHEESH KUMAR Sathyan Anthikkad continues the saga of the common man with his film ‘Katha Thudarunu,' which reaches theatres today. Scripted and directed by Sathyan, the film narrates the story of a single mother (Vidyalakshmi) who refuses to let circumstances crush her spirit or her sense of adventure. Common sense and sense of humour – the hallmark of every Sathyan film – is evident in this film as well. For the veteran director believes that if one is endowed with the two, one cannot be down in the dumps for too long. And who should know the secret of success better than this director who is celebrating his golden jubilee as a filmmaker with his ‘Katha Thudarunnu.'
Gift for comedy
Right from his first directorial venture, ‘Kurukkante Kalyanam,' Sathyan's heroes and heroines are people next door. Unerringly, he tapped the gift for comedy in actors such as Sukumaran, Nedumudi Venu, Mammotty and Mohanlal to eulogise the common man and his world of joys and sorrows. Over the years, he has gifted viewers with some of the most memorable heroes and heroines in Malayalam cinema.“All of them are my favourites,” says Sathyan with a smile. “But,” he adds, “among them it is undoubtedly Balagopalan of ‘T. P. Balagopalan MA' and Kochu Tressia of ‘Manasinakkare.' Balagopalan is very dear to me. All my other characters, I feel, are his cousins and friends. Preman (played by Jayaram), my hero in ‘Katha Thudurunnu,' could be his younger brother,” says Sathyan.Looking back at his eventful filmography, Sathyan says what he treasures during his stint in Mollywood are certain priceless moments that came his way on account of his work in cinema. “I cherish the fact that I was able to work with such a fine actor as Mohanlal. There were moments during the filming when he blurred the line between reel and real life. One moment, he could be laughing and joking but the moment he stands before the camera, within seconds, he becomes the character,” says Sathyan.A trifle sentimentally, he says he treasures the fact that he could hear, work and see playback singer K.J. Yesudas sing. “That is not something filmmakers of tomorrow would be able to say,” says Sathyan, also an evocative lyricist whose songs have been sung by Yesudas.Another golden moment he holds close to his heart happened while they were recording the songs of ‘Rasanthantram.' “Much before I entered tinsel town, Ilayaraja was someone I idolised a great deal. The fact that I am able to work with him is something precious to me. While the recording for ‘Rasathantram' was going on, Kamal Hassan's ‘Vettaiyadu Vilayadu' was being shot in the vicinity. During a break in the shoot Kamal would join Ilayaraja in the room that he used for composing. I told Kamal that my heroine's name was Kanmani in the film as I was inspired by his song ‘Kanmani Anbodu Kadhalan' in ‘Guna.' Immediately, Kamal hummed the lines of the Ilayaraja song sung by Kamal himself in the film. Ilayaraja played it on the harmonium and Kamal sang along. I value such moments more than awards and hits,” says Sathyan.Not that he is a stranger to hits and awards. Many of his films (especially the ones written by Sreenivasan and Lohitadas) have become classics in Malayalam cinema, while the much quoted dialogues have become film lore and a part of the vocabulary of Malayalis. He remembers with a smile how during the discussions for ‘Sandesham,' Sreenivasan had assured him: ‘I don't know if the film will be a hit or not. But it will certainly have the best of dialogues.'“Kerala was going through a period of political vacuum and that is when we began discussions on the film. Both Sreenivasan and I knew we had a good subject but we were unsure how it would work out on the screen. Finally it was Lohitadas who gave us the confidence to go ahead.” But when both Lohitadas and Sreenivasan became engrossed in their own works, Sathyan began writing his own scripts. “Fortunately, writing has never been a new domain for me. But I still discuss my scripts with Sreenivasan and other friends. For instance, in ‘Katha….' there is a twist to the story that was advised by Sreenivasan. Similarly, it was Lohitadas who advised me to make Narain's character a bank manager in ‘Bhagyadevta,'” says Sathyan.However, he avers that it is essential for a filmmaker to have his ear to the ground to catch the rumblings of change that shapes a society in transition. The veteran feels that many of today's films seem to have lost that lifeline to reality, which is one of the most important reasons for the problems plaguing Malayalam cinema. “I make one film and watch films for the rest of the year to understand what is happening around us. I must be one of the few people who must have watched the most number of Malayalam films that were released last year,” says Sathyan, who continues to live in the village (Anthikkad) that he has put on the map of cinema.Perhaps that is how Sathyan gives us those perfect snapshots of life in the suburbs, complete with three-dimensional characters who live their roles on the screen. “I am one of them,” says Sathyan. “I make a film when I have something to say.”With ‘Katha Thudarunnu' the raconteur unveils another facet of life in Kerala.

  | Photo Credit: special arrangement A modest but elegant house near Muttom in Thodupuzha, with waterfront views and greenery all around, makes for a rich frame for director Shaji Aziz's ‘Oridathoru Postman.' The film stars Kunchacko Boban, Innocent, Sarath Kumar, Kalabhavan Mani and Meera Nandan in the lead roles.“It's a serious A genuine story filled with humour, romance and sentiments,” says Shaji Aziz, who has earlier directed ‘Shakespeare MA (Malayalam)' with Shyju Anthikkad.“The story centres around the escapades of a father and son who live in this house. The father, Gangadharan (Innocent), is a postman in the village but not a very punctual one at that. He often fails to deliver letters and money orders on time and that is a cause of concern for all.“His long-suffering son, Reghunandanan (Kunchacko Boban), on the other hand, is a hardworking youth who teaches at a Public Service Commission examination coaching centre. He hopes to make it big but most of the money he earns from his salary, real estate and other businesses is barely enough to settle his father's bungles,” says the director.
Twist to the tale
“Reghunandanan often helps his father to deliver letters and comes across some letters that were left behind. He finds that the letters were addressed to one Yasin Mubarak and he decides to find him. The story takes a different turn once Raghunandanan sets off to find the addressee,” adds K. Gireesh Kumar, who has written the screenplay and dialogues of the film.Tamil actor Sarath Kumar, who has found great acceptance in Malayalam after his fine portrayal of Edachena Kunkan in the epic ‘Pazhassi Raja,' plays Yasin, a wildlife photographer. “Yasin is also an environmentalist. In fact, the sequences, which were shot earlier, had him requesting the villagers to keep their surroundings free from plastic waste, tobacco and so on. Presently we are shooting the scene where Yasin comes to meet Gangadharan,” says Sarath Kumar, while getting ready to face the camera.Meera Nandan plays Usha, a student at the coaching centre, who is in love with Reghunandanan, while Suraj Venjarammood, Salim Kumar and Jaffer Idukki, play “characters we would hope to come across in our villages” according to Gireesh Kumar.
Playing a cop
Kalabhavan Mani plays a cop, who despite talking and behaving in a comic way, is brilliant at his job and has a great track record.“The character is quite interesting and he presents himself initially in a comical way. I have really missed doing comedy for I love such roles. These days, though, I haven't had much opportunity to do such roles,” says Kalabhavan Mani.‘Oridathoru Postman' is being produced under the banner of Nila Creations.

43,My first break: Pyarelal,Rana Siddiqui Zaman,2010-05-06,15:58:10 IST,"Music Director Pyarelal
  
How it happened
Being from a musically driven family, I started arranging music at the age of 16. By 17, I became a composer. My father Pandit Ram Prasad Sharma, a trumpeter, taught me music and made me learn violin at the age of 12 from a Goan violinist. A famous director those days, who also gave a break to Kalyanji-Anandji was known to us. Once, I hesitatingly said to him, “You gave a chance to Kalyanji, give me one too.”He smiled and the next thing I knew was that I was to play the violin in the famous film “Haqeeqat” for which Madan Mohan composed music.The song was “Mein Ye Soch Uske Ghar Se Utha Tha.” He was so pleased with my performance that he came running and hugged me after the recording.
How it felt
At 17, it was thrilling and served as a great morale booster. In no time, he offered me “Parasmani”. That was in 1963. I couldn't believe my luck. Babubhai Mistry was a name to reckon with. No one would question his integrity. I and Laxmikant started working on the film. The film didn't do well but the music was a hit. It brought us close to known music directors like Naushad and Ravi and film producers like Tarachand Barjatya.
How life changed
The music of “Parasmani”, especially the song “Roshan Tumhi Se Duniya”, paved the way for us. The very next year director Satyen Bose gave us “Dosti”. It was Tarachandji's Rajshri Productions film. The film had new and young actors but its music was super hit. It got us our first FIlmfare Award in 1964. The most thrilling experience was that with “Dosti”, films like “Sangam” (music by Shankar-Jaikishan) and “Woh Kaun Thi” (Madan Mohan) were also nominated for the Filmfare Award.The award may have brought us fame, but unfortunately, it also created jealousy among our peers. Some of them canvassed against us and we stopped getting films. But we still got films from those who believed in us. Again from 1977 to 1980, we got the Filmfare Award consecutively for four years for “Amar Akbar Anthony” (1977), “Satyam Shivam Sundaram” (1978), “Sargam” (1979) and “Karz” (1980). In Ameen Sayani's “Binaca Geet Mala” our songs were regularly played among the top hits. Lata Mangeshkar made a great contribution to our success. She used to record 10 songs a month for other music directors, but for us she even sang 16 songs a month. Till date, I go to seek her advice in any music-related matter.Today, I miss Laxmikant, (he passed away in 1988) but I didn't stop making music. I have won friends like Jitendra, Dharmendra , Shashi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan in the film industry. Though I feel music has become quite technology-driven today, I always tell my students never to stop the use of acoustic instruments like flute, violin and sitar, for they are the basic ones. Today, there is even less poetry in songs. Dard-e-dil has become dard-e-disco. I and Laxmi did one good thing: We didn't take all films that came our way. We picked and chose even at the cost of sitting at home, unlike Shankar-Jaikishan. I still have lots of symphonies for kids that I wrote long ago, apart from western symphonies. I have few films today but I am happy that I haven't compromised with my kind of music.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/My-first-break-Pyarelal/article16298771.ece

And doing a negative role is a sure way of avoiding comparisons with my brother, because he’s never played villain,” he smiles.The young man has no problem admitting that he approached director Rasu Madhuravan for a chance to work with him. “I liked his ‘Maayaandi Kudumbathaar’ and called him up for an appointment. ‘I’ll get in touch with you myself,’ he said, and I thought it was another of those usual responses directors come up with.”But true to his word, Madhuravan contacted Vikranth and gave him ‘Goripalayam.’ “‘The film has 15 important characters and though yours has a negative slant, the scope it offers will be worthwhile,’ he told me. I make a late entry in the film but my character will make an impact,” he states with confidence. Those who have watched the film already have told him, “For the first time you don’t remind us of Vijay.” And wife Manasa who has been pulling his leg about his earlier roles, said, “You look nice in ‘Goripalayam.’” Vikranth and Manasa have known each other for long, and got married quite recently.Madhuravan has been so impressed with Vikranth’s show in ‘Goripalayam’ that he has booked him for his first production, ‘Vavvaal,’ to be directed by Bharatiraaja’s associate, So.Arulraj. Vikranth will also be working in Madhuravan’s next directorial venture.Criticisms about his earlier performances have singed the young actor. “I’ve been pained by comments,” he says. A debut film could make or irrevocably mar a hero’s career. ‘Karka Kasadara,’ his maiden attempt with Lakshmi Rai, wasn’t quite a judicious choice. “When I watched myself on screen I knew I had to start from scratch,” he concedes.Then came ‘Ninaithu Ninaithu Parthaen,’ again a non-starter. “But it had talented names Manikandan, Madhu Ambat, Joshua Sridhar …” defends Vikranth. Neither did ‘Nenjathai Killadhae’ in which he had ‘Ammuvaagiya Naan’ Bharathi as his pair work. “Directed by Agathiyan of ‘Kaadhal Kottai’ it is a film which I had pinned my hopes on,” he says.What did brother Vijay have to say about his performances? “He watched ‘Karka Kasadara’ and complimented me for my dances and stunts. ‘Work hard, talk little, turn a deaf ear to sycophancy and you’ll secure a safe niche in five years time,’ he advised. We meet often and discuss a lot of subjects but somehow, films haven’t been one of them.”Making it as a cricketer was Vikranth’s aim when in school and college. “In school Dinesh Karthik was my classmate and Badani my senior. Cricket, not acting, was the reigning passion then,” he says. Even today actors Arya, Jeeva, Ramesh, Ramana and Vikranth play regularly and participate in tournaments. The college team didn’t welcome the aspiring cricketer with open arms. Put off by the treatment meted out to him Vikranth gave up the game and began to concentrate on cinema.Like Vijay, Vikranth too began as a child actor. And again like Vijay who initially did ‘Senthoorapaandi’ with Vijayakanth to bolster up his career, Vikranth worked with the captain (Vijayakanth) in ‘Engal Aasan.’Getting back to ‘Goripalayam’ Vikranth says, Michael Rayappan, who is producing the film after the successful ‘Nadodigal,’ is immensely happy with the output. “He told Madhuravan, ‘You’ve done your job well. So my responsibility of taking it to the audience becomes greater now.’ For his part, Vikranth is keeping his fingers crossed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Trying-out-a-new-turf/article16298713.ece
45,Messiah off the mark,MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:23:14 IST,"ON USUAL LINES: Sura
  Adamantly adhering to the formula of a do-gooder’s one-man expedition against corruption, Vijay shows that he doesn’t intend to swerve even slightly from the path which he has trod on, in film after film. With ‘Sura’ (U) the capable crowd-puller follows the commercial pattern for the nth time in his career.Sura (Vijay) is the uncrowned prince of the fishermen’s colony, Yaazh Nagar. He offers succour to the people in his area and is looked upon as their saviour. Life goes on smoothly, till, of course, a Minister (Dev Gill) becomes too avaricious and all of a sudden wants to acquire the land on which the fishermen live.Vijay looks smarter than he did in his other recent films, his charming smile is intact, his poker-faced comedy has you in splits most of the time and his danger-courting stunts highlight his agility. Only when he overdoes things a little (like in the scene in court) does his performance lose appeal. So, if despite Vijay ‘Sura’ fails to sustain your interest it is the predictable story and the sagging screenplay that are to be blamed.Writer-director S.P. Raajakumar scores with his witty dialogue, though the fishermen’s gibberish about the greatness of the hero makes you want to scream. With MGR’s ‘Padagotti’ as the base Raajakumar has tried weaving a ‘modern’ yarn in a fishing settlement.A wealthy heroine falling for a poor fisherman is so outdated a premise that you don’t even find it funny anymore. The incongruity in the love affair between Sura (Vijay) and Purnima (Tamannaah) irritates.Vadivelu’s role of Umbrella is enjoyable whenever it melds with the main narration. Otherwise the track is just a time-wasting exercise.And what a let-down Tamannaah is, especially after her appealing chirpiness and pleasing screen presence in ‘Kandaen Kaadhalai’ and ‘Paiyya!’Ekambaram, the ace cameraman, who exquisitely captured the high seas that formed the backdrop of the story of ‘Iyarkkai,’ is in his elements once again in ‘Sura.’Zest marks Mani Sharma’s peppy numbers, and the pallavi of the opening song, ‘Vetri Kodi’ that portrays Vijay as a Messiah, is striking.A patient viewer can put up with a second love song, even when it hampers the flow of events. But by the time the lovers take off on their third duet he is down and out!Shooting an action sequence in the midst of a fleet of cars is fine, but why were two earth movers going this way and that like dinosaurs, in the background? Only the art director can explain the purpose!That it is his 50th film hasn’t come in his way of opting for the beaten track – so what if it is the half century mark and a milestone for an achiever, Vijay seems to ask.Predictable lines may have worked for one or two yesteryear heroes till the very end, but with changing tastes it is time Vijay begins to chalk out a different course. It isn’t dearth of talent, only an erroneous choice of roles. Come on Vijay, you can do it!",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Messiah-off-the-mark/article16298847.ece

  | Photo Credit: g mail R
aavanan is almost ready and for Vikram it's another dream come true. “You know, I used to think one film each with Mani Ratnam and Shankar and I wouldn't mind retiring in that blaze of glory,” smiles Vikram. Always a picture of effervescence, mention Ratnam and his Raavanan (
Raavan in Hindi), and Vikram's energy level revs up further! He plays solid roles in both the Hindi and Tamil versions of the film — Raavanan is being dubbed in Telugu too. “Audiences in Andhra are bound to be floored by the subject,” Vikram's words ooze confidence.Interestingly, he isn't replicating the Tamil role in Hindi. “Here I'm Veera and in Hindi, Dev,” he smiles and on a serious note adds, “I hear that it's the first time in the world that an actor simultaneously plays two diametrically different roles in two languages of the same film.”
First straight Hindi film

Raavan isn't just Vikram's first project with Ratnam. It is also his first straight Hindi film. That he is being launched by the same reputed maker whom he yearned to work with sometime ago is a bonus! “You said it. Though Aparajith (
Anniyan dubbed in Hindi) didn't do too well, it's been telecast over 17 times so far. Yet Raavan is my first Hindi film,” he explains.Ratnam popped the question to Vikram just when they were about to begin shooting for Raavanan. “I think you can pull it off. Why not give it a shot?” he suggested. “Are you sure,” was Vikram's pithy response. Being in the habit of working on his physique and make-up to suit every part he portrays Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously. But locations were very remote and sets may not last for more than a month, he was told.So what did he do? “I've played little tricks with my body language and expressions and they should work,” he smiles cryptically. “I'm like a bull in one version — tough, rugged and a man who lives for the moment. In the other, my character is poetic, philosophical, fun loving… just about everything.”After the Hindi audio launch in Mumbai, the attention he got from the girls in particular was surprising. “I mean, after all these years…” he laughs gaily.Has he tried out a new look for Hindi? “Surely not the clean shaven look. I don't intend to look like other heroes. I've plumped for a close hair-cut and moustache. In Hindi my presence has been kept under wraps as of now. I'm the proverbial dark horse,” he chortles.Not many know that Vikram had earlier screen-tested for Mani Ratnam's Bombay. “But the wait has been worth it. Over the years, I've evolved as an actor. I feel in Raavan Mani has transcended his earlier achievements. The films should hit the bull's eye.”Working with Ratnam has been an engaging experience for Vikram. “He's open to your inputs. Raavanan And his energy is unbelievable. After a day's work, we would rehearse the scenes to be shot the next morning, costumes et al, before we dispersed. He would mull over them all night and be ready with the changes he wants.” ”Vikram can't stop talking about the films' locations. “We've shot entirely in India and you can't but say ‘Wow! We didn't know such beautiful places exist here.' We've gone to the unexplored plateaus of the Malshej Ghats, beyond Pune, and to the mist-covered Orccha near Jhansi where we saw clouds just sitting down on the roads through which we walked. Sameer Chanda's sets have blended so well with the milieu that you can't differentiate between the natural landscapes and those created.”They've also shot in the remote areas of Kolkata and the rarely-visited terrains on the other side of Chalakudi. “Manikandan and Santhosh Sivan have captured them so beautifully on camera,” comments Vikram.
Big ride to scenic spots
The unit was put up in an ashram of sorts on the hills, from where everyday they travelled for about an hour by car, then geared up for a 30-minute jeep ride after which they trekked another 15 minutes to reach the scenic spots!“AB (Abhishek Bachchan) and I have given our interpretations of the roles. But Raavan is more an AB film,” says Vikram. And about working with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, he simply says, “It was nice.”Now that his aspirations have been realised, what more could he want? “I've recorded a song for G.V. Prakash for Madrasapattinam along with MSV. And I'm waiting for a chance to sing for A.R. Rahman. I love his Raavanan compositions, especially ‘Veera' and ‘Usirae Pogudhae.' Also I want to turn director one day… so there's a lot more left to be done,” he guffaws.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/lsquoRaavananrsquo-a-re-incarnation/article16299040.ece
47,This joke's on you,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:57:33 IST,"The Sajids (producer Nadiadwala and director Khan) virtually declared war on film critics by setting a historic precedent. They not just refused to have a press screening for reviewers but also went on record giving reasons for their decision — nature of the film's genre, effect of premature criticism on its business, advent of Twitter fuelling word-of-mouth bad reviews, etc.Once you watch Housefull, you realise that's what any smart filmmaker would do. No sarcasm there. Seriously, Housefull is an inspired escapist, borderline plagiarised, no-holds-barred, silly slapstick comedy that does not even pretend to have a plot, let alone logic or plausibility.Many of the jokes are forced in, the filmmaker trying to milk the ridiculousness of situational comedy for as many laughs as possible per minute even if it means letting characters slap each other for no reason at all.While critics revel in taking on films like these and more so, given the public display of arrogance, reviewers seem to have ridiculed the film for all the wrong reasons. Housefull has got plenty of flak for being a crude, sexist, offensive comedy. Like that's a bad thing.Though comedies such as American Pie, Dumb and Dumber, Road Trip and The Hangover have been celebrated as cult classics, the genre still remains in the domain of low-brow entertainment and filmmakers attempting it here are the favourite whipping boys of critics. Most of it has to do with plagiarised plots, situations and even lines, though the makers in some cases have gone ahead and acquired the rights to remake the film (while continuing to take credit for Story, Screenplay and Dialogues).
Housefull is a classic case study of factors plaguing comedy in India, despite the emergence of Judd Apatow's unapologetically offensive films as a legitimate sub-genre.So if these overtly sexist films are accepted and embraced by men and even women of late at an International level, why can't we laugh when Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh decide to do a Ben Stiller gag?Here's why. Originality factors apart, these adaptations are just not funny enough. While Housefull provides a considerable number of laughs in the second half, there are also a considerable number of jokes that fall flat all through the film.Within the film's first few minutes, we learn that Akshay Kumar plays a loser who brings bad luck to all around him and hence, is employed by a Casino that wants to make sure all their clients lose their money. If you are wondering how the Casino remains unaffected by his bad luck, you ought to get out of that movie hall when you still can. This is not your kind of film.The loser then decides to stay at his best buddy's place in London only to get married to the wrong girl (who does a Heartbreak Kid on him during their honeymoon in Italy) and falls in love with another girl (while Forgetting his Sarah Marshall) and in the second half of the film, needs to Meet The Parents… Or the Brother in this case, who is the same suspicious brother borrowed from Right Bed, Wrong Husband (last adapted in Ajay Devgn's All The Best). The makers also find time to recycle gay jokes from Kal Ho Na Ho and Dostana.Yes, the guys are cool and the women are totally hot when they are prancing around in bikinis. But with barely an original bone in its skeletal story outline, Housefull at best works in bits and starts as a series of inspired gags — many forced and a few spontaneous. Hate it as much as you want but you will find it impossible to stifle a laugh.Watch it only if you are forgiving and don't mind junk food for the thoughtless.

48,Reason to cheer,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:55:43 IST,"Trust good old Clint Eastwood to craft a film that transcends the spirit of sport with its political layering without compromising on the integrity of a riveting sports film or the reputation of a celebrated leader of a nation while focussing on one of the lesser-known aspects of his personality.Mandela's interest in the game was not just a political move but a “human calculation,” as the newly elected President (Morgan Freeman lends a lot of grace and dignity to Mandela) insists, quite early on.The docudrama begins with Mandela's first day on the job as the new President. “He can win an election but can he run a country,” asks the front page of a daily as he goes for his early morning walk, with just two security guards for company.Eastwood loses no time at all to introduce us to the security risks, and the sub-plot with his security aides keeps the drama alive (the moment with the plane over the stadium is a heart-stopper) when the sport portions of the film are yet to take off.Though based on the book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation, the filmmaker takes some cinematic licence to replace Mandela's source of inspiration. Apparently, Mandela in reality had given the rugby captain Pienaar an extract from Theodore Roosevelt's speech that inspired him and not the poem Invictus written by William Ernest Henley.
Invictus is the story of a President who decides to channel the country's passion for sport as a unifying force to blur racial differences by deciding to back the dominantly white Springboks team when the rest of the Sports Ministry is baying for the blood of the players and stepping up the pressure to change the name of the team.But it's also the story of the other leader, the rugby captain Pienaar (Matt Damon's on a roll — The Green Zone and now, Invictus) who has to motivate the team and back the lone-black player in the team and see the team through its rough patch and strive for the kind of glory they hadn't even imagined.Eastwood's genius lies in making us see how the challenges both these leaders face were not too different and the solutions weren't too different either.Between Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, the actors have oodles of charisma to charm the audience and they turn in a sincere, natural portrayal, backed with some crisp writing (Anthony Peckham).It helps that Eastwood resists the urge to hero-worship the President and treats him like an ordinary dutiful old man, who despite his superhuman faith in humanity, is a vulnerable workaholic with a miserable domestic life.This sort of sensitivity and balance is what makes Eastwood the master filmmaker that he is and that's exactly what makes Invictus transcend the sport film genre and keeps us hooked till the very end despite the predictability of the format.A truly inspiring and uplifting sports film guaranteed to make you feel good.
Genre: Drama
Director: Clint Eastwood
Cast: Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, Tony Kgoroge
Storyline: Two leaders, Nelson Mandela and Pienaar, the captain of his rugby team, need to inspire a country and the team by setting an example and leading from the front.

Kutti Pisasu' starts off with ‘Amman' specialist Ramya Krishnan reprising the role of yet another village protector, this time as Kenathadi Kali. Once her prowess is established through two sequences, including one where screen scorcher Nasser is reduced to a pale shadow of himself, it's time to move on to 200 years later.Priya (Keethika), a precocious child, the daughter of Ramjhi and Sangeetha, gyrates to adult steps and draws like a dream, coming up with a visual of an ancient yellow car. Soon, she is possessed by the spirit of a girl called Savithri (a terribly out-of-sorts-and-shape Kaveri — whatever happened to the cute actor?).Cut to flashback mode, and the stories of Savithri, her brother, Karuppu (Ganja Karuppu) and their adored yellow car (washed only with warm water, mind you!). Savithri is cheated by her fiancé Nanjappan (Riyaz Khan), and given as sacrifice by his sorcerer friend Mandiramoorthy. Her brother also dies in the process of saving her. His spirit is locked in the yellow car, till Kenathadi Kali frees him to avenge his sister's death. Two of Nanjappan's friends are killed by the possessed child — one in the harbour and another in the circus ring — and, he's next in line. Enter a miniature villian (Mandiramoorthy's guru) mouthing “Jakkamma” ever so often, and the stage is set for a lopsided fight, not-so special effects and all.Finally, evil is vanquished, but not before you are forced to sit through some more songs where your heart bleeds for the child artiste, who seems to have little else to do other than look startled, angry and roll her eyes, all this in the midst of bad lip-sync.Ramjhi and Sangeetha have little to do except perform pujas, make thayir saadham, and cry about their daughter's fate. And, Delhi Ganesh plays the grandfather who loves ftv. Ouch!There's little to say in terms of story or production value. Strange, considering director Rama. Narayanan is a veteran in children's and godly movies, even if they are terribly over-the-top! As for the music, Deva's brief seems to have been to come up with such high-decibel dabbankuthu that even the Transformers-look-alike dances. He succeeds.Now, the only question is how this can be called a fun film for the kids to go to this summer! There's gore, the sacrifice scene leaves you retching and the dialogues are written with least sensitivity.

The big move
Director Vijaya Varman's Biriyani, an emotional drama of the plight of a young domestic help, has won teenage actor Poo Myli, the ‘Best Actress' award at the Short Film Festival of Los Angeles. The film, based on Subhalakshmi Narayanan's short story, and with music by Mohan Narayanan, has been Varman's stepping stone into films. He now directs a full-length Tamil film, Ninaivodu Vilayadu, starring Master Mahendran and Nandana. The music is by Swar Mogi, while Varman has written the story, screenplay and dialogues.”
Recreating a hit
Twenty-seven years ago, Thyagarajan acted with Sarita, Silk Smita and Jayamalini in the huge hit Malayoor Mambattiyan, which was remade in Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Now, he has cast his son Prashanth in the new version of the film, titled Mambattiyan, with Meera Jasmine and Mumaith Khan for company.Will the new film re-create the magic of the original? With Prakash Raj and Vadivelu in key roles, the theme should work with present-day audiences, we think.
Getting real
Tiruvannamalai's 10-day Brahmotsavam, where more than 15 lakh devotees throng the town, forms a major part of the A.G. Raja-produced , Ivar. Directed by N. Priyan, the film was initially meant to be Raja's directorial venture. “Since I was introducing four new actors as the main leads, I felt that someone as talented as Priyan should also be given a chance to prove his talent. And, he has done a wonderful job,” says Raja.The film revolves around four youngsters who are interested only in the present. Since the film focusses on the men, the songs feature male voices too. Also, there are no choreographed dances or ‘contrived' fight sequences, says the producer. “There's a dance, but an impromptu one that happens in a TASMAC bar,” he adds.
Novel attempt
Director Keera's Pacchai Engira Kaathu is the story of 27-year-old Pacchai Ramkumar, narrated from the point of view of seven individuals. Based on a real-life incident, Keera's movie is about the life of youth who blindly support politicians and parties. Newcomer Vasagar plays the hero, while another new face Devathai plays his love interest. Says Keera: “The story is narrated in flashback mode by four persons at the time of the hero's unlikely death. As the film progresses, two more persons join the narration, including the heroine's sister. Finally, I, the director, complete the story.”

he svelte Shilpa Shetty judged the first season of ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa', the second season of ‘Bigg Boss' on Colors and will now be judging the second season of the war-of-the-genders dance competition, ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' on Star Plus. The actor on judging celebrities and why television works for her.
You have only two films — “The Man” and “Desire” lined up. Are you gradually bidding goodbye to films?
Sunny Deol's “The Man” has been stalled. I shot for “Desire” six months ago, but there is still some work left. I really wanted to take a break… I have been working continuously for the last 18 years. I have so much happening that I just do not have the time.
Meanwhile, it seems you have taken a liking to television — after ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa' and ‘Bigg Boss', it is ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha now.
Television works well for me because it does not take too much of my time, the audience sees me and I enjoy the chance to say my bit in front of people. So I always try to do something different on TV every year. ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance show and is obviously different from ‘Bigg Boss' in which I was a host. And though I have been a judge before, this is a new format.
But there doesn't seem to be any significant difference in the show's format — it will be the same girls versus boys competition.
The difference would be us — the new set of judges. The show is being aired on Star Plus and so more money has been spent on the production, packaging, costumes this time around.
Being a dancer yourself, do you get impatient or irritated when untrained celebrities perform badly on a platform such as likethis?
‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance-oriented show and I know a bit of dance, so my job is a little easy. All the participating celebrities are good dancers — we have sifted out the bad ones.
Does the at fact that you will be judging ‘TV celebrities' make it difficult for you to criticise them?
All the participants know that they will be judged; and that we are here to judge them. We are not here to pinpoint who is a bad dancer and who is better. We are here to see who performs better on a particular day.
Will the jury be biased towards the girls because it consists of two women — Vaibhavi Merchant and you — while Arshad Warsi is the only mansole male?
As judges, we have to forget the gender we belong to and have an unbiased opinion. I will try my best to do that.
Is there any particular dance form which you are still not confident about?
I'm not very good with locking and popping. I'm so glad it has come in recently; and not in my time (
laughs). I don't think my body is meant for that kind of dance form; my arms are very long. I just love the way these new kids do this dance. I'm amazed by the talent we have in our country. I'm a Bharatnatyam dancer but for “Desire” I had to learn Odissi and it was difficult, inspite of being a dancer.
Who are your favourite dancers from the industry?
I think Rishi Kapoor was a phenomenal dancer. He never missed a single beat. See his songs. I'm sure the choreographer never ever told him to do the step a particular way. He was superb … what synchronisation!
We saw husband Raj Kundra by your side throughout the IPL. Any chances of him making an appearance on this show?
Star Plus cannot afford him. They still do not have that kind of money.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Reality-bytes/article16298702.ece

  The master story teller is back to making a socio-romantic musical entertainer after a gap of five years. Veteran filmmaker K. Raghavendra Rao is making his 105th celluloid statement, Jhummandhinaadham with a theme that largely harps on our rich traditional music and heritage, according to producer Lakshmi Prasanna. Starring her brother Manoj Kumar Manchu and debutante Tapsi in the lead with her father Mohan Babu playing a pivotal character.At the Ramoji Film City, the atmosphere is one of celebration. A celebration showcasing unity and patriotism, capsuled into a song written by Chandra Bose and composed by Maragatha Mani Keeravani. Raghavendra Rao usually does the preliminary designing of the song sequence, making the job of the choreographer easy.Choreographer Suchitra Chandra Bose in consultation with the master craftsman is guiding the actors to perform that includes apart from the lead pair and Mohan Babu, Suman, Brahmanandam, M.S. Narayana, Pragathi, Aishwarya and others.
Desamante Matham kadhu… the song is played on the nagara and lensman S. Gopala Reddy captures the emotions of the actors. Desamante Manushuloy the song continues as the next block is taken for filming. It reminds you of the song, Punyabhoomi Naa Desam Namo Namaami from Major Chandrakanth in which the legendary N.T. Rama Rao played the title role. Keeravani is at his best one more time, you agree as you listen to the song.“It is a musical story with nine songs,” informs Lakshmi Prasanna. “A lot of research has gone into the making of these songs and the story. We are forgetting our traditional songs. How many of us know today that once during marriage ceremonies, songs recalling the family tree and roots of the bride/bridegroom are sung as the marriage parties reach each other's house. It is like nostalgia to the older generation and introduction of our rich traditional heritage to the young audience.”A wide variety of musical bonanza- from folk, lullaby, devotional, patriotic to fusion music awaits the discerning cine goers. “There is a competition song filmed on dad (Mohan Babu) and Manoj on the lines of the one that was shot on Nagesh and dad in Allari Mogudu,” says Lakshmi Prasanna.The camera now focuses on Manoj and Mohan Babu as they place their steps to Keeravani's tune. “This is the first time dad is playing a full length role in a Manoj film,” says the happy producer. “This movie presents Manoj in a different light, as a soft looking guy. In looks and acting it is a complete makeover from his earlier movies,” says the proud sister. Manoj has that certain ease in his acting be it in action, comedy or emoting.The conversation shifts to Tapsi, the newcomer to Telugu cinema. “ She plays a girl from the U.S. who is on a research work on Telugu traditions, music and culture.

53,Bale Piaa!,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:30:05 IST,"Very few actors here come without strings attached. Especially, the watchful eye of mom or dad on the sets. Piaa Bajpai of Goa fame is one of those rare actors who does it all by herself.As her film Bale Pandiya, directed by Siddharth Chandrashekar, readies for release (the audio launch happened recently), Piaa talks about her journey that began here with the Khosla Ka Ghosla remake, Poi Solla Porom, and continues with the K.V. Anand film Ko, to be out in August.
How it started
But, her journey to showbiz started five years ago when the girl from Uttar Pradesh left home for Delhi after doing a diploma in computer science.“I wanted to prove to my parents that I could live by myself. Giving tuitions was good business in Delhi back then. You could make up to Rs. 1,500 a kid. So if you took tuition for seven to eight kids, you could make good money. I also worked as a receptionist.“After a year, I got tired of going to office, coming back and doing nothing else. For a year, I had not taken money from my parents. Then, they grew confident about me, and I shifted to Mumbai,” she recalls.
Dubbing for serials
Piaa started dubbing for TV serials. “Since I was from U.P., my Hindi was good. I could make Rs. 250 - Rs. 300 doing just one session. Then, I started getting offers only for dubbing. When you want to see yourself on screen, but are dubbing instead for someone else, it's very depressing. So, I decided to stop dubbing, and started doing print ads, then commercials and music videos.”The auditions led to a commercial directed by Priyadarshan. “I was very apprehensive about working in the South because I didn't know anyone here. But, when Priyadarshan Sir asks you if you want to audition for a Tamil film, how can you not do it? I lied to him that Tamil wouldn't be a problem,” she laughs.“They auditioned me in English and Hindi and the Tamil audition came much later.”Now that she has shot for a few Tamil films (
Poi Solla Porom, Aegan, Goa, Bale Pandiya and Ko), Piaa understands the language better. “I write my lines in English-Hindi and memorise them, and the director tells me how to emote.”“In Bale Pandiya, I play a happy girl living with her grandfather. She falls in love with a boy who thinks he's a loser. We shot for three to four months. It's a good role,” she says, narrating an anecdote about how she fought sea-sickness with cans of tamarind. “We were shooting on a yacht, and I wasn't used to the sea.”Shooting by the beaches and partying in Goa for Venkat Prabhu's Goa, and now sailing. What a difficult life for an actor!“It's not like that. You have to shoot when you are not well. Sometimes, in the hot sun… you have to sing, dance, smile, not be tense, or look tired. No matter what's going on in your mind, it should not show on your face. It gets tough for me sometimes, because, when I am upset, it shows on my face.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Bale-Piaa/article11639885.ece
54,My First Break: Dhyana,S.R. Ashok Kumar,2010-05-06,14:25:54 IST,"I learnt Bharatanatyam at a tender age. When I finished my masters in Bio-technology, I got a chance to act in a film by popular director Logidas. Unfortunately, it did not materialise. So when Meera Kathiravan, his associate, asked me to act in his film, I didn't evince much interest. Moreover, it was not the role of the heroine. But the director succeeded in convincing me and the film was Aval Peyar Thamizharasi.It was exciting to see myself on the screen. I watched the film in a theatre in Tenkasi where I had been on a holiday. To my surprise, people recognised me and some even came forward to talk to me. They wished that I should appear on screen more often.After my debut, people recognise me wherever I go. Except that nothing much has changed. Acting is a passion for me. I would like to do more powerful roles and make a mark in the industry. I did not do any other film for nearly a year as I was waiting for a good break. Virunthali is a good film produced by Rajesh Gopinath for Gopika International and directed by Whaterman. This is my second film and I am awaiting its release — I am sure it will be a box office success.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/My-First-Break-Dhyana/article16298693.ece

Akshay plays monkey!
With hi-definition technology being the order of the day, Housefull producer Nadiadwala Grandson has tied up with Hungama Digital Media and launched a digital promotion campaign for the multi-starrer. An online game application has been devised on the Akshay-monkey slapping episode from the film. The player can choose to be either the ape or Akshay and the objective of the game is to slap the other person harder.When we asked Akshay to make a choice, he jested, “I'd rather be a monkey as his reflexes are stronger.” When it was Deepika's turn to answer, she spontaneously replied, “I'd always be Akshay because I could never hit him.”
No Ranbir for now
There has been much talk in tinseltown about Ranbir-Deepika's on-off relationship, not just onscreen but off screen as well. Last seen together in Bachna Ae Haseeno, there was a buzz about Deepika signing her next film opposite the young Kapoor.When queried about it at an event, she curtly said, “When I sign, I'll let you know.”
Humour to the rescue
Sajid Khan, director of Housefull, is making a tall claim. He brags that Akshay's comic timing in his film will remind the audience of the peerless comedy king, Kishore Kumar, especially in his scenes with Riteish.The proof of the pudding lies in the eating. And Akshay amply provided the proof when he bailed Sajid out. Some time back, Manoj Kumar was miffed with Sajid and had said that flinging mud at others only makes the person who is flinging the mud, dirty. At the Housefull event, a contrived Sajid responded to Manoj's comment with, “Manoj Kumar is a veteran and I will never make fun of him. If he thinks I am mud, then so be it.”Akshay instantly quipped, “After all, a lotus can grow only in mud,” and made an otherwise sheepish Sajid grin from ear to ear.
Archana's role
Ask Badmaash Company director what his wife Archana Puran Singh's contribution to his film was and the hunky Punjabi actor-turned-director says: “When I took a break for this film, she became the husband as well as the wife. She took care of the finances which took most of the burden off my head. Finances are something that can kill a man; and this was why I couldn't become a director earlier. I was trying to fulfil my duties as breadwinner, husband and father. Finally, when I decided I needed to do something for myself and live my dream for once, she said ‘Go fulfil your dream'. I'm very fortunate I have a wife like her.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Mumbai-Express/article16298688.ece

58,Blast from the past - Bhooloka Rambai (1940),RANDOR GUY,2010-05-06,14:11:29 IST,"A SUCCESS STORY: Bhooloka Rambai
  
K.L.V. Vasantha, T.K. Shanmugham, T.R. Mahalingam, T.S. Balaiah, N.S. Krishnan, T.A. Mathuram and Kumari Rukmini
K.L.V. Vasantha was one of the popular heroines of early Tamil cinema. Slim and attractive, she could also sing well. She made her debut in Sri Kanda Leela (1938), a Premier Cinetone, Coimbatore production, directed by noted filmmaker H.S. Mehta, and written by well-known writer L. Nanjappa Chettiar, one of the directors of the production company and studio.Vasantha hit big time in 1939 when she played the title role in Rambayin Kaathal, directed by noted filmmaker B.N. Rao. Critics remarked that the celestial beauty of Lord Indra's court, Rambha, would have looked like Vasantha!Following the success of Rambayin Kaathal, Vasantha was cast in Bhooloka Rambai. A folktale with many twists and turns, it's about a prince (Shanmugham) falling in love with Bhooloka Rambha (Vasantha), their secret marriage, getting a child to be sacrificed, and later saved by Divine Grace… His friend (Mahalingam) travels with him; they meet birds that talk and predict their future. Again directed by Rao, the film was produced by M. Somasundaram (Jupiter Somu) and M.D. Viswanathan under the banner of Salem Shanmugha Films and Vijaya Maruthi Pictures at Central Studios, Coimbatore. During the making of the film, the producers ran into financial problems and work halted for sometime. Around this time, the later day Indian movie mogul S.S. Vasan had just entered as a distributor with his Gemini Pictures Circuit (GPC) and was looking for movies for distribution. He called on Rao at Coimbatore and asked him whether he could complete the film in time for Deepavali if he funded the project. He also told him he was in the process of acquiring a studio in Madras, and promised Rao that he would be the director of his first production. Vasan who never went back on his word engaged Rao for the first Gemini Studios production Madanakamarajan (1941) which somewhat interestingly had much common ground in Bhooloka Rambai (both were written by well-known writer and playwright B.S. Ramaiah.)
Bhooloka Rambai proved a success and Vasantha's popularity grew by a few more notches. Besides being cast as the heroine in Madanakamarajan, Vasan cast her as ‘Chandralekha' in his mammoth movie. However, for many reasons, Vasantha opted out, and T. R. Rajakumari came on board to create movie history.In those days, Tamil films were screened all over South India without any dubbing or subtitles, and people watched them with interest. To give them an indication of the storyline, producers invariably had an English title for each of the Tamil film. For example, Gumasthavin Penn had the title, Clerk's Daughter!For the same reason, the name of this film in English was given in posters as Bhooloka Rambha and not ‘Rambai' as in Tamil. B.N. Rao told this writer years later that the name of the celestial dancer was Rambha and not Rambai!As usual, the N. S. Krishnan-T.A. Mathuram pair took care of the comedy and sang a couple of duets in their own inimitable style.
Remembered for: the interesting storyline, gripping on-screen narration, the impressive presence and performance of Vasantha, and the comedy of Krishnan-Mathuram.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Blast-from-the-past-Bhooloka-Rambai-1940/article16298691.ece

  Director Hari has reasons to cheer, as his impending Suriya-starrer Singam will have its audio launched on May 11. Taut screenplay and climactic surprises will be the crowd-pulling factor of the film and the film is set to create waves, he said.The film also marks the 10th project of the director and 25th film for Suriya. The director said the second half would stir considerable curiosity among the audience and has all the ingredients of a racy entertainer.Suriya dons the role of a police officer in the film, pairing up with Anoushka. Hari has a signature style of setting his films in lush countryside and this film will be no different. The story is based in Thoothukudi and nearby villages, with some portions shot around Chennai. Suriya has got a makeover and would sport a new look as a police officer, with a stylish moustache. “His film Kaakha Kaakha is still quite popular with Tamil audience. It was tricky for me to pull out Suriya off that image. I created this character as a personality that is a contrast to the role of ‘Anbuchelvan',” he told The Hindu recently.The film will have a lot of action sequences and a good amount of hilarity, with Vivek handling the comedy track. Hari promises that the movie will have logical sequences and everyday issues are narrated in cinematic language. The director does not brook comparisons with filmmakers scripting off-beat movies. “They are doing an excellent job and taking Tamil cinema to the next step. But the industry also needs some dose of commercial element. I have no intentions to attempt such different storylines. Commercial movies are my forte.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Hari-hopeful-of-Singams-roaring-success/article16303871.ece

  With prices of essential commodities cooling a tad on arrival of rabi crops, food inflation softened further to 16.04 per cent for the week ended April 24 from 16.61 per cent in the previous week.Even as the general expectation is that a normal monsoon, if as projected by the India Meteorological Department comes true, would help in easing food prices further, fuel inflation held steady at 12.69 per cent owing to higher prices following the hike in duties on petrol and diesel.Significantly, despite persistent demands by the Opposition earlier this week for rolling back the hike in fuel prices, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee held firm and expressed his inability to do so owing to the fragile fiscal situation.The gradual decline in food inflation for the second week in a row has raised hopes of some moderation in the overall inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for April from the March level of 9.9 per cent. The headline WPI inflation data for April is expected to be released next week.According to Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu, the headline inflation is likely to soften to 6-7 per cent in the coming months. “I expect the overall WPI to come down to 6-7 per cent in the next three months,” he said.However, despite the declining trend in recent weeks, food inflation has remained above 15 per cent since November last year. Keeping this mind, the United Nations' organisation ESCAP has expressed concern over the food price spiral even as it projected a cool-down during the year.During the week, inflation eased on account of lower prices of fish, wheat, fruits and vegetables which declined by one per cent each. However, the prices of tea went up by 13 per cent while gram, maize and eggs were also dearer by one per cent each.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Food-inflation-softens/article16298862.ece

  As board examinations slowly fade into memory and students prepare for their results, the season of obtaining application forms for various courses has begun.Most government and self-financing institutions have started issuing application forms for admission into professional as well as arts and science courses. But, with intense competition pushing students to have multiple backup options, application fee collected along with the forms seems to have become a revenue-generating option for colleges, say parents and students.G. Abdul Haseeb, a parent, says “Some professional colleges give 15-page application forms with pictures of the college library and canteen printed on glossy paper. As a result, they charge exorbitant amount as application fee.”He says that it especially affects students in the 60-to-75 percentile category who might want to keep options open and end up applying to many colleges. “Some kind of regulation is needed and a uniform application fee regime must be brought in.”K.Ramnath, awaiting his class XII results, says “My parents wanted me to apply to many courses. I have already spent more than Rs.2,000 on application forms. I will also be applying for law and a couple of bachelors programmes.”Students also say that if one applies for two or more courses in some colleges, a separate fee has to be paid each time. The application cost of popular courses such as B.Sc Visual Communication is twice that of a B.Com course in the same college.S.Narasimhan, principal, DG Vaishnav College, which is an aided institution, says that irrespective of the number of courses in a college, there must be only one application form. “Students can give their course preference in a single form. Government guidelines also clearly state that colleges must give out applications only after the Class XII results are announced. Students have to be given the chance to make an informed choice.” Higher Education Secretary, K. Ganesan, said that there was no reason for one college to have multiple forms. “Instructions will be issued to all colleges in this regard immediately.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/lsquoApplication-form-season-on/article16298633.ece
65,No words to explain the exceptional depravity: Judge,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,23:58:57 IST,"The “brutality” of offences committed by Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab, the “depravity” of his mind and his “voluntary” act of becoming a terrorist as per the prosecution's case formed the basis for awarding the death sentence to the lone surviving attacker of 26/11.The special sessions court in its reasoning for the sentence stated: “There is no evidence of mental or emotional disturbance. On the contrary, he [Kasab] appeared to be mentally prepared. The court has taken note that this man [Kasab] voluntarily went to the office of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. No leader took him there. He along with his friend Muzaffar went from place to place without being accompanied by anybody [from Lashkar]. He [Kasab] offered to become a mujahid. He was prepared to face all kinds of training. He refused the option of returning to his relatives' place and preferred to [remain at the training camp]. There is no chance of reformation or rehabilitation of such a person. The way he has committed the offence gives the court no scope for considering his reformation or rehabilitation.”The court rejected the defence argument of moral justification for Kasab's crimes as it found it to be “frivolous.” It also rejected defence lawyer K.P. Pawar's contention that his client was acting under duress and domination of the Lashkar bosses.“Where is the duress,” the court asked. “He and Muzaffar knocked on the door of the Lashkar office. He has shown no duress or domination. Instead, the delay in the attack [upset] him. He was anxious to attack India. He asked the wanted accused [of Lashkar] why there was a delay.”The criterion of young age was rejected by the court in the light of “the aggravating factors as argued by Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam on behalf of the State.”“The murders were committed after previous planning. Not only was there previous planning, but meticulous and systematic planning with all the modern equipment available. All possible precautions were taken to see to it that the attack was a success. The court has accepted Mr. Nikam's argument,” judge M.L. Tahaliyani said.In agreement with the prosecution's argument of unimaginable brutality, the court noted, “[The memory of] brutality was writ large on the faces of the witnesses. When you read the evidence of witnesses at CST [Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus], see the photographs of [photographer] Sebastian D'Souza, I don't think any words are required to describe the brutality. Some witnesses were not even ready to be police witnesses although having seen the incident, and some were not ready to come to court although their statement had been recorded by the police.”Commenting on the incident, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “There are no words to explain the exceptional depravity seen in the initial stages of commission of offence. When he fired indiscriminately, it was without any regard; children and women were killed.”The court also took into consideration that police officers and public servants were “assaulted, injured and killed” by Kasab and his associates.Having listed the observations, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “It is difficult for me to prepare a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The balance is totally in favour of the prosecution.”The court took into account the observations made by the Supreme Court in Bacchan Singh vs. State of Punjab, 1980. However, it noted that the nature of crimes committed by Kasab and the other attackers were not in the sight of the apex court. “The facts of this case are very different. The circumstances are so aggravating that it is impossible to mitigate any of the circumstances.”The judge also drew upon the principles of jurisprudence by jurist Salmond: “To enjoy an effective system of law we have to impose a penalty which [befits] the crime committed by the accused.” Referring to the case of Ankush Maruti vs. State of Maharashtra, he said, “Undue sympathy to give less penalty will do more harm to the justice system.” With reference to the case of Dhananjay Chatterjee alias Dhana vs. State of West Bengal, the court observed the rights of people at large need also to be considered along with the rights of the convict.Mr. Nikam expressed his happiness for the verdict before the media. “Today we have been successful in giving justice to the victims of 26/11 and the departed souls. I also feel relieved on being discharged from Arthur Road jail. We did not fall for the foul games Kasab was trying to play. I think the Crime Branch officers, they deserve all the praise.”Kasab's lawyer on the other hand said he was satisfied with the work he had done. “It was very difficult for me to defend; the evidence was voluminous. I did my job successfully and the court appreciated my efforts. The way I placed my case was the most important thing for me. I could find many good points. It's the court's jurisdiction whether to accept or reject the arguments. I am satisfied with my endeavours,” he said.The court sentenced Kasab to life imprisonment for offences committed under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 307 (attempt to murder), 307 read with 109 (abetment) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 364 (kidnapping or abducting), 121 A (conspiracy to wage war), 122 (collecting arms with the intention of waging war), and Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/No-words-to-explain-the-exceptional-depravity-Judge/article16298877.ece

67,Kasab sentenced to death,Rahi Gaikwad,2010-05-06,23:08:13 IST,"Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab “shall be hanged by neck till he is dead.”Pronouncing these words, the Special Sessions Court here on Thursday sentenced to death the lone surviving gunman of the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.Kasab was given the death penalty on five counts: murder, abetment to murder, waging war, criminal conspiracy and committing terrorist acts.He was also awarded life imprisonment on five counts: attempt to murder in furtherance of a common intention, kidnapping and abducting in order to murder, conspiracy to wage war, collecting arms with the intention of waging war and causing explosion thus endangering life and property.‘
Aapko char offences ke liye sazaye maut di jaati hai. [You have been sentenced to death for four offences],' Judge M.L. Tahaliyani told Kasab after he read out the order.“You have been given the death penalty for murdering Indian citizens, police officers, conspiring with Lashkar leaders and committing terrorist acts. The court has said while giving the judgment that you shall be hanged unto death,” Mr. Tahaliyani told Kasab. While the sentence was being read out, Kasab sat still, his face sunk deep in the cup of his palm. He listlessly waved when asked by the court to give an opinion on his sentencing. Anxiety drew him to ask for water and he had to be taken out of court. “
Shukriya saab [Thank you, sir],” was all the 26/11 convict could say on his way out of the courtroom.The court wholly accepted the prosecution's arguments for awarding the death sentence, noting that the “aggravating circumstances” fully outweighed the “mitigating circumstances.” It found that the defence could not make out a case for the lesser punishment of life.“In my opinion, the circumstances demand that death penalty be imposed in this case. The court has no option but to impose death sentence. This man has lost the right of getting humanitarian treatment,” the court observed.The court also referred to the Kandahar hijack incident triggered by the presence of the accused in the custody of the Government of India. Mr. Tahaliyani noted, “By keeping such a person alive there would always be a danger hanging over the government. He is a constant danger. He is a menace to society. He has no right to live.”The Indian Penal Code Sections under which Kasab has been given death penalty are: 302 (murder), 302 read with 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war), 302 read with 34 (common intention) and 302 read with 109 (abetment) read with 120 B.In addition, he has been given death for the offence punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. For the other offences, he was awarded rigorous imprisonment, simple imprisonment and imposed with fines.Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told reporters that a confirmation of the death penalty from the Bombay High Court was awaited.

  Setting the ball rolling for the resumption of dialogue with Islamabad, Minister for External Affairs S.M. Krishna on Thursday announced that he would speak to his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi soon after the end of the Parliament session on Friday.Mr. Krishna is expected to discuss the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Qureshi as well as between the two Foreign Secretaries. These interactions were agreed upon by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani in Thimphu last week to address the trust deficit between the two countries. Subsequently the two Foreign Ministers agreed to get in touch after the end of the ongoing Parliament session.Replying to clarifications in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Mr. Krishna was positive about the prospects of the two countries normalising their relations in the light of free and frank discussions between the two Prime Ministers.“An ideal situation has come about in transforming our relations. The mood, ambience, tone and tenor of the Pakistan Prime Minister were indeed encouraging and the Indian Prime Minister put across our core concern about terrorism.“I am sure in the light of these discussions by the Prime Minsters we are in the right direction in trying to create trust and harmony. I am sure that ultimately the whole region will stand to benefit from the thaw with Pakistan,'' he said.The Foreign Minister said the first steps towards reducing the distrust quotient by holding talks between the principals of the Foreign Ministries were being taken following Pakistan's assurance of “adequately'' meeting Indian concerns on terrorism.A meeting between the Foreign Secretaries in February this year was intended to send the message to the people of Pakistan that India believes in “open door, open communication policy.''Terming the beheading of a Sikh in Pakistan as “heinous and inhuman,'' the Minister pointed to the unequivocal condemnation by its President Asif Ali Zardari and his assurance of providing adequate security in keeping with his declaration of Pakistan being a pluralistic nation.Mr. Krishna said India was involved in reconstruction work in Afghanistan at the request of its government. “It behoves India that whenever such an invitation comes we should go there and do our humble bit…India is not militarily involved and our volunteers have gone there to help Afghanistan to be self-reliant and self-confident. No doubt there are elements not disposed to be happy with cordial India-Afghan relations. We have lost valiant men but let me assure you that our involvement is going to continue and not going to be deterred by such attacks,'' he declared.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Krishna-sets-ball-rolling-on-dialogue/article16298954.ece

Anyone who volunteers for the job can do it. Even if there is no hangman to be found, any police officer from the rank of a constable can also do it if he volunteers,” a Tihar Jail official said.Legally, the government can appoint a hangman either for short-term or as a permanent appointee.“If there is such a problem, it is only temporary. The government can either appoint someone on a short-term basis or permanently. Moreover, any jail official can also do the job if he wishes,” G. Venkatesh Rao, senior Supreme Court lawyer, who was also involved in the Indira Gandhi Assassination case said.It was in 1989 that Satwant and Kehar Singh, convicted in Indira Gandhi Assassination case, were hanged to death.The latest case of execution was of Dhananjay Chatterjee who got the death penalty for murder.Chatterjee was kept at the Alipore Jail for 14 years before his mercy plea was rejected by former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and he was hanged to death on August 14, 2004.He was executed by the 87-year-old hangman Nata Mullick in West Bengal. Mullick, whose father Shibal Mullick was a hangman in the British colonial days, died in December 2009.Major jails across India face an acute shortage of trained hangmen.Only men are employed for this job and the candidate has to be above 5 feet 4 inches tall.Other than the morbid nature of the job, the meagre salary also acts as a deterrent.

  Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday said conviction of Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab proved that the present laws were adequate to deal with the menace of terror.

They have broad support of all sections...Let's try these acts. If necessary, we can always revisit them.”Mr. Chidamabaram said while he respected the BJP's views, a large section of society, particularly minorities and SCs/STs, rejected these ideas as they feared their misuse against them.Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said though Kasab's conviction was a landmark event, he was disappointed because there were several other accused in the case living in Pakistan and the U.S., from where not much cooperation was forthcoming.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Conviction-came-without-anti-terror-law-Chidambaram/article16298874.ece

  On May 9, when people across the country will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, Kolkata-based St. Xavier's School and College will join in the celebrations for its former student, whose association with the institution, though brief, was close to the poet's heart.Though the Nobel laureate strongly disliked the system of institutionalised education — resulting in his being home-tutored for most of his academic years — he studied at the school for almost two years; perhaps his longest stint as a student in any school during his lifetime, and penned down his memories of the period on several occasions.Organised by the Alumnorum Societas and the St. Xavier's College (Cal) Alumni Association, the celebrations will be marked by a recitation of Tagore's ‘Sesher Kobita' (Last Poem) by actor Soumitra Chatterjee and Dhritiman Chatterji in the presence of several noteworthy alumni of the institution.The programme will also coincide with the school's celebration of its 150th year of existence.Tagore was admitted to the fifth standard in 1875, at the age of 14, along with his elder brother Somendranath Tagore and nephew Satyaprasad Gangopadhyay. The St. Xavier's was the fourth and last school he attended before his father decided to home-tutor him.In one of his accounts, Tagore wrote about his disinterest in school education. “I could understand that my value in the civilised society is going down. But I can never connect myself with a school that shuts out life and natural beauty and conjures up frightening images of a prison or hospital,” he had said.His experience at the St. Xavier's School, according to him, was relatively happier. Though most teachers appeared to him as “mere teaching machines,” he was fond of a Jesuit priest, named Father Alphonsus De Peneranda, who had come from Spain and was appointed a part-time teacher.Tagore reminisced in one of his accounts that while most students in Father Peneranda's class were inattentive due to his lack of fluency in English, the poet felt a deep sense of empathy and respect for his teacher.Historians researching Tagore have found out from school records and accounts of his classmates that the school's annual calendar misspelt the poet's name twice as ‘Nobindronath Tagore,' that he failed in the fifth standard, that his roll number was 36, and that he came to school in a horse-drawn carriage.While Tagore left the school in 1877, he came back to his alma mater in 1931 to preside over a function organised by the teachers and students to collect funds for people affected by the devastating floods in Bengal that year.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Tagores-school-to-celebrate-his-150th-birth-anniversary/article16299038.ece

Panchal said.The bench, however, said improvements can be made in the working of the scheme.The bench said the mere allegations that the funds are prone to be misused cannot be a ground for scrapping the scheme.It said that both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have standing committees to monitor the scheme and there are various levels of accountability for its implementation.The apex court said that the scheme has benefited the local area development by way of providing water, electricity, infrastructure, library and sports facilities.It rejected the contention of the opponents of the scheme that it gives an unfair advantage to the sitting MPs against their political rivals.The bench said there is no reason to believe that the MPLADS cannot be implemented and monitored by the district authorities. The scheme is for the public interest and public purpose.The court said it was satisfied that under the scheme, there is no violation of separation of power.Interpreting Articles 282 of the Constitution, the bench said that Parliament validly holds power to disburse funds for the scheme.The scheme had come under judicial scrutiny after a sting operation in 2005 showed some MPs allegedly demanding money from contractors to award work for projects under MPLAD scheme. The expose had led to the expulsion of members from both Houses of Parliament.The MPLAD scheme had been in the news in 2006 due to allegations that trusts run by the then Election Commissioner Navin Chawla’s family got funds from the scheme.A three—judge bench on July 12, 2006 had referred the matter to a five—judge Constitution Bench observing that important questions of law needed to be settled.The scheme was first challenged in 1999 by Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party Chief Bhim Singh and an NGO, Common Cause, alleging that in the absence of any guidelines, the funds allocated under the scheme were misused by MPs.Later, petitions were also filed in various high courts and on the Centre’s intervention all the petitions were transferred to the apex court.Attorney General G E Vahanvati, who was then Solicitor General, had submitted that MPLAD Scheme is also a welfare measure implemented with the assistance of the local authorities like other schemes Jawahar Rozgar Yojna, Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme and Integrated Child Development Scheme.The funds under the MPLAD (Member of Parliament Local Area Development) Scheme were directly released by the Centre to the district authorities and it did not go directly in the hands of the MP, he had submitted.The Centre had defended the scheme, saying that it had the authority of law to release money under it as funds were withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India by passing the Appropriation Bill.The opponents of the scheme had alleged it was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution (Right to Equality) as it gave arbitrary powers to an MP without there being proper checks and balances, monitoring and accountability regarding the money being spent under it.NGO Lok Sevak Sangh had contended that the scheme gives an unfair advantage to serving MPs over their rival candidates in elections.The NGO had said the powers exercised or enjoyed by the MPs by virtue of MPLAD scheme results in discrimination between various sections of society in allocation of work.It was argued that though there is a provision in the guidelines that an MP who does not want to use his funds may withdraw from the scheme, it has not been done by any of them.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/SC-upholds-Constitutional-validity-of-MPLAD-scheme/article16298679.ece
83,’26/11 Mumbai attacks help New York police to be better prepared’,PTI,2010-05-06,09:32:30 IST,"New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. File photo: AP.
  The New York Police Department (NYPD), learning lessons from the 26/11 Mumbai attack, has taken necessary steps to prevent any such type of terror attempt, a top US cop said today.“As part of our comprehensive response to what happened in Mumbai, we’ve held tactical drills and tabletop exercises with officers from our Special Operations Division based on that scenario,” New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in his testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.Mr. Kelly had testified before the same committee last year about the NYPD’s response to Mumbai—like terror assault in 2008, which claimed 183 lives.“As you may recall, that attack was carried out by small teams of operatives using AK—56 assault rifles. By sustaining the operation for hours, they maximised the casualties,” he said.NYPD has trained “more than 250 additional officers” in the use of heavy weapons to “supplement” the work of emergency service officers in a crisis.“We’ve also decided to use the instructors in our Firearms and Tactics Unit as another reserve force,” he said, adding that all of its police recruits would now receive basic instruction in three types of heavy weapons.“We’ve taken these and other measures because we believe an attack involving active shooters is always a possibility.Likewise, we must also guard against terrorists armed with homemade bombs, whether a car bomb like the one we saw in Times Square or stashed inside backpacks for a suicide mission like the one planned for last September in New York subways,” Mr. Kelly said.The officer noted that the department’s subway bag search programme is designed to counter terror threats like the 2005 London bombings.Mr. Kelly rued that their undercover operations showed the “ease” with which terrorists can purchase explosive ingredients such as chlorine and ammonium nitrate in the US.“These efforts are part of a robust counter—terrorism programme we built from the ground up in 2002, when we realised that in addition to our focus on crime fighting, the police department needed to build the intelligence collection analysis and infrastructure protection capabilities to defend New York City from another terrorist attack,” Mr. Kelly said.The NYPD had also established the nation’s first municipal counter—terrorism bureau and structured a intelligence division.“We recruited the best that the federal government had to offer to head those two operations,” he said.Similarly, the department had created a new civilian intelligence programme to support field commanders, who have tapped the “incredible” logistic diversity of the police department, with timely information and analysis.“We assigned native speakers of languages such as Urdu, Arabic and Pashtu to counter—terrorism duties. We strengthened our patrol of key infrastructure in the city, including bridges, tunnels and a host of landmarks and other sensitive locations,” Mr. Kelly said while listing out the measures taken after the Mumbai terrorist attack.A team of officials were sent to Mumbai to have first hand information of the terrorist operations there in November—December 2008.“We forged collaborative relationships with the private sector with law enforcement organisations up and down the East Coast and with federal agencies, especially the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security,” Mr. Kelly added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rsquo2611-Mumbai-attacks-help-New-York-police-to-be-better-preparedrsquo/article16298672.ece
84,"In public interest, Centre keen on intervening in MCI",Aarti Dhar,2010-05-06,02:03:56 IST,"The Centre is contemplating bringing in an ordinance to amend the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 empowering the government to intervene in the event of MCI members, including the president and the vice-president, being unable to perform and on grounds of misconduct.The ordinance seeks to fix the term — to a maximum of two – of the president and the vice-president and give the Union Health Ministry powers to make arrangements in the event the office of president falling vacant in unforeseen situations as it has arisen now. The functioning of the Medical Council of India has come to a virtual standstill following the arrest of its president, Ketan Desai, on corruption charges.These amendments are expected to incorporate major changes suggested by the Ministry in the amendment Bill, tabled in 2005, which were turned down by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health.Sources in the Ministry told The Hindu it was keen that the government be able to intervene in the MCI in the “larger public interest” as did the Human Resource Development Ministry in the case of the All-India Council for Technical Education and the University Grants Commission under Section 20 (1) of the AICTE and the UGC Acts though these were nominated bodies. The MCI is an elected body with no such provision for intervention by the Centre. A provision for intervention was turned down by the Standing Committee on the ground that it would seriously jeopardise the independent working of the MCI and decision making of its president and vice-president.
Final decision
The proposed amendments to the MCI Act — if and as approved by Parliament — will continue until the government takes a final decision on whether medical education should come under the purview of the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) under the HRD Ministry or the National Council for Human Resource in Health being pushed by the Health Ministry.Meanwhile, the NCHER has invited a Health Ministry representative for its final meeting later this week. This is the first time the Ministry has been invited for deliberations, though the Medical Council of India, the Dental Council of India, the Nursing Council and several other regulatory bodies in the field of health have made representations before the Commission.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/In-public-interest-Centre-keen-on-intervening-in-MCI/article16298638.ece

  In a snub to the Manipur government that has banned his visit, National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) leader T. Muivah on Wednesday arrived on the State's frontiers. From there, he is set to embark on a journey to his birthplace, where prohibitory orders have been issued and security heightened to avoid tribal unrest.Mr. Muivah reached Viswema village, near the Nagaland-Manipur border, on his way home to the Somdal village in Ukhrul district.Escorted by members of the Naga civil society, Mr. Muivah left the NSCN-IM headquarters, Camp Hebron, near Dimapur at noon after a brief prayer and arrived here to a warm welcome at the check gate on the National Highway 39. He was then escorted to the Viswema village, 25 km south of this town.Mr. Muivah was to stay overnight at Viswema, from where he had planned to go to Somdal on Thursday, said the Naga Hoho leaders, who are coordinating Mr. Muivah's entourage.The Nagaland police have provided Mr. Muivah with a bullet-proof vehicle, while security forces have been deployed on the national highway, a senior police officer said.At least 50 vehicles, mostly occupied by members of Naga non-governmental organisations, including women, escorted Mr. Muivah to Viswema.In a hurriedly convened press briefing at the NSCN-IM headquarters on Tuesday night, Mr. Muivah said he would go ahead with his planned visit to his village, which he said was agreed upon by the Centre.“I must go there and no force can stop me. My parents died waiting to meet their son.”He said he failed to understand why Manipur was objecting to his visit, adding: “The opposition to my visit came as a surprise...the visit is for peace, to meet family and friends and not to disturb anyone...We will not claim anything which belongs to the Meiteis [an ethnic group of Manipur], let them have theirs, we will only have what is rightfully ours.”The Manipur government has stepped up security and clamped prohibitory orders on the other side of the Mao inter-State gate to thwart the entry of the Naga leader.The NSCN-IM, one of the oldest and powerful rebel groups in the northeast, has been demanding a ‘greater Nagaland,' which it proposed be formed by merging the Naga-populated areas of adjoining States. The demand has been rejected by Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram is understood to have asked Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh to ensure that Mr. Muivah's visit is safe, following a request by Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Muivah-says-no-force-can-stop-him/article16298632.ece
86,‘Recognise right to worship Ram Lalla',J. Venkatesan,2010-05-06,01:40:03 IST,"The right to worship Ram Lalla at the disputed site at Ayodhya must be recognised by court. For, this place has been believed to be the birth place of Lord Ram by millions of Hindus for several centuries, senior counsel Ravi Shankar Prasad argued in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court.A Full Bench comprising Justices S.U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D.V. Sharma is hearing final arguments in the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. In the suits pending since 1989 Muslims sought a declaration that the area in dispute be declared a Babri mosque.After the completion of arguments on behalf of the plaintiffs in March, senior Supreme Court lawyer Prasad, representing the interest of Hindu worshippers, who claim as of right worship of the deity of Ram Lalla at Ram Janmasthan at Ayodhya, commenced his arguments on May 3.Mr. Prasad argued that in Hindu ethos and Hindu customary law, duly sanctified for the last thousands of years, “the concept of deity is a very distinguishing feature unlike in other religions. This deity is the manifestation of the Supreme Being which is eternal, permanent and omnipresent. The temple is the home of the god and the idol is a manifestation of the Supreme Being.”Quoting scriptures, he said: “The Hindus' concept of deity can also be shapeless and formless as they worship both Vayu and Agni. Even a log of wood or a piece of stone or the Sangam at Prayag, where — it has been believed by people for generations — a dip in the trinity of three rivers washes one of all sins, has also been exalted to the status of a deity. The Hindu concept is that a deity does not die nor is it subject to decay, and if an idol is stolen or is damaged or is defiled, a new idol installed [at the same place] acquires the antiquity of the old.”Counsel said: “The Ram Janmasthan fully answers the description of a deity held in reverence by the Hindus for the last thousands of years.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lsquoRecognise-right-to-worship-Ram-Lalla/article16298620.ece

  | Photo Credit: Sushanta Patronobish Announcing the induction of West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC) working president Subrata Mukherjee into the Trinamool Congress here on Wednesday, party chief Mamata Banerjee indirectly accused the State Congress of “conspiring” with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to break up the alliance between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress in the State.“The people's grand alliance has struggled against the tyranny of the CPI(M) for the past 33 years. Whichever party might conspire with and support the CPI(M), it is useless since the latter has lost all power…these agents of the CPI(M) will eventually realise that the real power rests with the people's grand alliance as those who flee from a battlefield are never respected,” Ms. Banerjee said.The Trinamool chief was speaking at a press conference where Mr. Mukherjee formally announced his decision to quit the Congress and join the Trinamool.Pointing out that her party is a “part and parcel” of the coalition government at the Centre and is committed to the alliance, she claimed that it had always tried to maintain the alliance and had worked hard accordingly.Exuding confidence about her party's prospects in the upcoming civic polls, Ms. Banerjee asserted that Mr. Mukherjee's decision to rejoin the Trinamool was “necessary for history, for change, for the State and its people” and appointed him the party's senior vice-president.Echoing Ms. Banerjee's words, Mr. Mukherjee said he had of late started doubting the Congress' intention of maintaining the alliance and felt “useless” in the party. “The truth is that it was a deliberate attempt to break the alliance. The CPI(M) has a major role behind it ,” he added.After functioning as Mayor of Kolkata under the Trinamool banner, Mr. Mukherjee had left the party and joined the Congress five years ago following differences of opinion with Ms. Banerjee.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Trinamool-committed-to-alliance-Mamata/article16298660.ece

89,Criminals may benefit but citizens' rights should be protected: Court,J. Venkatesan,2010-05-06,00:08:26 IST,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would be failing in its duty if it permitted any citizen to be forcibly subjected to narco-analysis, brain mapping and polygraph tests in violation of his privacy. Notwithstanding the fact that its judgment would benefit hardened criminals who had no regard for societal values, the court had a constitutional right to protect the rights of citizens.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said: “One of the main functions of constitutionally prescribed rights is to safeguard the interests of citizens in their interactions with the government. As guardians of these rights, we will be failing in our duty if we permit any citizen to be forcibly subjected to these tests.”
Unjustified intrusion
Irrespective of the need to expedite investigations in sensitive cases, no person, who was a victim of an offence, could be compelled to undergo any of these tests. Such forcible administration would be an unjustified intrusion into mental privacy and could lead to further stigma for the victim.“It must be borne in mind that in constitutional adjudication our concerns are not confined to the facts at hand but extend to the implications of our decision for the whole population as well as future generations.”The Bench said: “Forcing an individual to undergo any of these techniques violates the standard of ‘substantive due process' which is required for restraining personal liberty. Such a violation will occur irrespective of whether these techniques are forcibly administered during the course of an investigation or for any other purpose since the test results could also expose a person to adverse consequences of a non-penal nature.”
Inhuman treatment
On the contention that these techniques could be read into the statute within the ambit of ‘medical examination' in the Criminal Procedure Code, the Bench said such an expansive interpretation was not feasible. “It would also amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with regard to the language of evolving international human rights norms. Furthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered from these techniques comes into conflict with the right to a fair trial. Invocations of a compelling public interest cannot justify the dilution of constitutional rights such as the right against self-incrimination.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that a person could make an incriminating statement on being threatened with the prospective administration of any of these techniques. Conversely, a person who has been forcibly subjected to these techniques could be confronted with the results in a subsequent interrogation, thereby eliciting incriminating statements. While the scheme of criminal procedure as well as evidence law mandates interference with physical privacy through statutory provisions that enable arrest, detention, search and seizure, among others, the same cannot be the basis for compelling a person ‘to impart personal knowledge about a relevant fact'.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that an individual may give his/her consent to undergo the said tests on account of threats, false promises or deception by the investigators. For example, a person may be convinced to give his/her consent after being promised that this would lead to early release from custody or dropping of charges. However, after the administration of the tests the investigators may renege on such promises. In such a case, the relevant inquiry is not confined to the apparent voluntariness of the act of undergoing the tests, but also includes an examination of the totality of circumstances. The questionable scientific reliability of these techniques comes into conflict with the standard of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt' which is an essential feature of criminal law.”
“Only an aid”
The former CBI Director, R.K. Raghavan, welcoming the judgment, said: “These tests are a dubious tool in the hands of the investigator. It [test] has been more romanticised than the real benefit in the investigation. Within my knowledge, it has not served any useful purpose in any major investigation. It is only an aid.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Criminals-may-benefit-but-citizens-rights-should-be-protected-Court/article16298615.ece
90,All radioactive sources of varsity irradiator accounted for: AERB,R. Ramachandran,2010-05-06,00:04:22 IST,"The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) has identified and accounted for all the cobalt-60 radioactive sources originally present in the gamma cell irradiator of the Chemistry Department of Delhi University.Stating this in a pres release here on Wednesday, the AERB said that the sources would continue to remain in the safe custody of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).It would be recalled that the irradiator, supplied by the Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) in 1968, had been in disuse since 1985 and was auctioned away to scrap dealers on February 26. This had found its way to the metal scrap market of Mayapuri in West Delhi. Without realising that there was a radioactive source in the scrap, two Mayapuri shops where the scrap had finally landed dismantled the equipment and cut open the irradiator into several pieces. This resulted in the people directly involved in the operation and handling the pieces to high doses of radiation. This caused severe radiation poisoning of seven people engaged in the scrap metal business one of whom has since died. The other six continue to battle for life – one at Apollo Hospitals and the rest at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.Following a complete survey of the market, officials of the AERB and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) stated that they located 11 radioactive sources in all — eight from one shop, two from another and one from an individual who was in its possession. Given the badly mangled state of the irradiator and its pieces, it was not clear then whether the 11 sources were all separate sources or were pieces of a single source. These radioactive materials were moved from Mayapuri in mid-April to the Narora Atomic Power Station (NAPS) in U. P.Detailed inspections of the materials recovered were carried out by the AERB officials at NAPS on May 3 and 4 following which the statement was issued. The statement clarifies that all the pieces originated from this single Delhi University gamma irradiator's Co-60 source. This also makes it clear that reports appearing in the media about ‘missing radioactive pencils' and the ‘source trail leading to Rewari (in Haryana)' were incorrect.According to S. K. Malhotra of the DAE, the reconstruction was made possible by the details of the original device that was supplied to the university in 1968, which the AERB managed to obtain from the AECL. Apparently the AECL responded to the query with great efficiency and supplied the details of the sale 42 years ago within a couple of hours. Mr. Malhotra also confirmed the initial activity of the source was over 3,000 curies (Ci). After 42 years, or 8 half-life periods of Co-60, the activity would have dropped by a factor of 2 to the power of 8, or 256, only. (One curie stands for 37 billion radioactive decays/sec.)According to the details provided by the AECL, the source chamber had provision for 54 pencils of Co-60 of which only 16 were occupied at the time of supply based on the requirements specified by the user. Each cylindrical pencil is made of 7 ‘slugs' or pieces of Co-60, each measuring about 2.5 cm x 0.6 cm stacked together and all the pencils constitute a unit that can be placed around any material to be irradiated with gamma rays. The AERB claimed that they were able to account for all the 112 slugs of the 16-pencil Co-60 source unit.In a related development, the Delhi University teachers' Association (DUTA) has demanded an impartial enquiry by the President of India, who is the Visitor of the university, into the callous disposal of the Co-60 source to scrap dealers. In particular, the DUTA has called for a enquiry into the constitution by the vice-chancellor of the committee that authorised its disposal and into the inexplicable silence on the part of the university authorities for as long as 20 days when the Delhi police and the AERB were groping in darkness to hunt down the origin of the radioactive material. “In this context, the speedy work by the Delhi Police in tracking down the origin to the Chemistry Department of Delhi University needs to be commended, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/All-radioactive-sources-of-varsity-irradiator-accounted-for-AERB/article16298577.ece

Chandy died in 1997 and their mother, Princy, in 2000. At the time Bency was 5 years old and Benson, 3. They then came under the care of their maternal grandparents. Their grandfather Geevarghese passed away in 2006.The siblings were one of the best publicised cases of HIV-positive children being denied access to school. The issue had attracted the attention of even the international media. Attempts by the grandparents to get them admitted in several schools were denied mainly because parents of other students threatened to withdraw their children from the schools if the siblings were allowed to study there.This compelled Geevarghese to undertake a fast in Thiruvananthapuram in 2003, which in turn resulted in the then Chief Minister A.K. Antony, calling a high-level meeting to solve the issue. Initially, a private tutor was appointed at their home and exams were also written separately.Later, as the constant campaign on AIDS awareness began producing results, the siblings were given admission to one of the schools that earlier denied them admission. Bency and Benson were presently studying at the Adichanalur Panchayat High School with other children. Bency was in Class 9 and had been promoted to Class 10.In September 2003, during an interaction with the siblings in Thiruvananthapuram, the then Union Minster for Health and Family Welfare, Sushma Swaraj, hugged them in public in an attempt to dispel myths and the stigma attached to the condition. On that occasion, Ms. Swaraj announced the public-sector Hindustan Latex would meet the educational expenses of the siblings for five years. Benson and Bency also had a meeting with former President of India A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Bency-passes-away/article16298837.ece
97,Muthalamada ‘mango city' goes hi-tech,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,19:51:55 IST,"Muthalamada in Chittur taluk, known as the ‘Mango city' of the State for its early mango harvest and large-scale export, is going hi-tech in sorting, grading, ripening, packing and export of mangoes.The first modern facility for mango processing and export in the State — Chittur Agro Park — began functioning in Muthalamada last week with technical support from the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bangalore.The Horticulture Mission Kerala has recognised it as a model unit for process and export of mangoes. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has provided financial assistance to set up the Rs. 50-lakh Agro Park. Mango growers can bring their product here and get them sorted, graded, ripened and packed for export or to send it to cities like Mumbai and Delhi for a good price.The Agro Park employs ethylene-based ripening , which is recognised internationally as a safe method for ripening fruits. The Park has ripening and pre-cooling chambers. This mangoes can be kept for three weeks without damage, said Becker Palliparambil, exporter of mangoes to the Gulf countries and the persons behind the new Agro Park.He said four tonnes of mangoes can be ripened at a time. The park will function round the clock during the season to benefit the farmers of Muthalamada and other places.Mango growers here had been using a lot of chemical pesticides to kill fruit flies, which rupture the outer skin of the fruit to lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the pulp of the ripe fruit. Deputy Director of Agriculture Department (Horticulture Mission) Jose Varghese says these insects can be effectively controlled by the new methods used in the Agro Park.At present, calcium carbide is widely used for ripening mango. In this case, the acetylene gas liberated is highly carcinogenic. This has to be strictly avoided. To get more orders and good prices in national and international markets, mango should be organically cultivated and ripened, he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Muthalamada-lsquomango-city-goes-hi-tech/article16298828.ece

They suspect Mr. Nair to have entered into a suicide pact with his daughter. The duo could have fed Devanjana with food laced with poison, possibly a pesticide, before consuming the lethal substance themselves. Mr. Nair's bedridden wife was in the house at the time.The police said Lakshmi had lost her job in the Gulf where she was employed as a nurse for sometime.

99,100 injured in Kinaloor violence,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,19:48:20 IST,"About 100 people including policemen were injured in a pitched battle between the police and local people at Kinaloor, 24 km from here, on Thursday after several hundred protestors prevented a team of revenue officials from conducting a feasibility survey for a proposed four-lane road to the KSIDC industrial park located on the Kinaloor industrial park.The protestors had blocked the load leading to the estate with large boulders and timber logs in the morning when the officials, led by Revenue Divisional Officer K.P. Remadevi, arrived for the survey. Soon a pitched battle broke out between the protestors and the police and women constables were seen dragging women and children from the frontline of the blockade.The police resorted to a lathicharge to cow down the protestors and they responded by hurling stones at the police. Several protestors including women and at least one child were injured in the lathicharge. Several policemen sustained injuries in stone-throwing. The police used a grenade and teargas to disperse the crowd. They chased the protestors into nearby houses.The residents in the area have been questioning the rationale of laying a four-lane road to the park ever since a Malaysian government agency that had proposed a satellite city at Kinaloor withdrew from the project in September 2008. Also, there are rumours of a ‘land mafia' having purchased large swathes of land at Kinaloor in view of the Malaysian project.The police allegedly damaged a car and a motorbike owned by a persons after he refused to cooperate with policemen searching for fleeing protestors. His daughter told presspersons that the policemen used expletives and behaved in a menacing manner.Thamarassery Deputy Superintendent of Police Kuberan Namboodiri was among those who suffered major injuries. Among the 55 persons who came to the Community Health Centre at Balussery for treatment, 44 were police personnel.A protestor who sustained injuries on his back and left leg said several persons injured in the lathicharge did not seek treatment in hospital for fear of police persecution.The survey resumed after the police managed to disperse the protestors.Meanwhile, a tense situation gripped the area outside the estate when Communist Party of India (Marxist) activists and the protestors regrouped there. This time, the police preferred to watch the situation from a safe distance.The CPI(M) workers alleged that the protest and violence were orchestrated by outside elements. They said the policemen were provoked into lathicharging after the protestors sprayed a solution of cow dung on them.The protestors said they had only convened a Jana Jagrata Samiti on the occasion. “We blocked the team that came for the survey three times earlier. There were policemen then too, but no violence happened. This time, policemen were sent with orders to use force against us,” alleged a protestor.District leaders of the Congress, Indian Union Muslim League, Bharatiya Janata Party and the Solidarity Youth Movement soon arrived at the scene. The situation eased following Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan's orders to stop the survey. The Chief Minister directed the District Collector to submit a report on the incident. This was welcomed by the protestors, who took out a march later.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/100-injured-in-Kinaloor-violence/article16298826.ece

  | Photo Credit: S_K_MOHAN The ongoing agitation by the local residents against a toddy shop at South Bazar here and the counter-protests by toddy tappers reached a flashpoint on Thursday. Irate toddy tappers, led by their union leaders, stormed into the venue of the agitation, destroyed the thatched structure erected by the agitators and opened the toddy shop that had remained closed for over 40 days.The toddy tappers reached the venue in a procession around 11.15 a.m. demanding that the shop, employing 30 toddy tappers, be allowed to function. Police personnel, outnumbered by the toddy tappers, were pushed aside and they remained mute witnesses to what followed.As the toddy tappers gave vent to their wrath, local residents at the venue ran to the safety of a nearby house. The workers then opened the toddy shop and measured the toddy brought there. The incident occurred after Sarvodaya Mandalam leader Thayat Balan inaugurated the fast by a resident expressing solidarity with the agitation.
Some injured
The agitators alleged that four women were injured in the assault by the toddy tappers. The union leaders claimed that a toddy tapper was also injured. A policeman also suffered injuries in the melee.The agitation began on March 23 when a group of local people came out against the shifting of the toddy shop from an old rented building to a new building, hardly 10 metres away, purchased by the co-operative society running the toddy shop. All efforts for a settlement came to naught as the agitators insisted that the toddy shop, which has been in the area for 42 years, will not be allowed in the locality.
Question of livelihood
The toppy tappers' union leaders said that the workers were just asserting their right to do their job. They claimed that the agitators refused to attend meetings to discuss alternatives. The workers could not be afford to be onlookers when they were denied their right to livelihood, they added.Kerala Madya Nirodhana Samiti activist T.P.R. Nath, who was at the venue of the agitation when the workers went berserk, said the agitators would discuss with supporting organisations the future course of action.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Toddy-tappers-agitators-clash/article16298825.ece

  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised to refer to an expert panel Kerala's plea for conferring ‘classical' status to Malayalam.The Prime Minister, who gave a patient hearing to the delegation led by Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy, Culture Minister M.A. Baby and poets O. N. V. Kurup, Sugathakumari and K. Satchidanandan, said while Kerala appeared to have a strong case, it was for experts to decide on the State's plea.“The Prime Minister gave us a warm welcome and patiently listened to our arguments. We are hopeful that this initiative by the Culture Minister and the State government would produce a positive outcome,” O.N.V. Kurup told The Hindu here on Thursday evening.“This is a very significant initiative by the Culture Minister which was long overdue. We look forward to some change. We will also continue to strive for securing classical language status for Malayalam,” added Sugathakumari.A language is accorded classical status if it is at least 1,000 years old, has a rich a literature and an independent literary tradition. Malayalam is the only South Indian language that has not been accorded classical status.“We are not asking for any relaxation in the criteria because we are confident that Malayalam does fulfil all the criteria. What we ask for is patient consideration of our arguments which, we are confident, no independent minded panel would be able to reject,” said O.N.V. Kurup.
Submits memorandum
In the memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister, the delegation pointed out that Malayalam had developed sufficiently much earlier than 12th century.Malayalam, the memorandum said, is as ancient as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada as it belonged to the Proto Dravidian family of languages. It was the language of the ancient ‘Chera' Kingdom, which underwent gradual transition like its sister languages, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu. For long, the word ‘Tamil' was a synonym for the word language. ‘In fact this served as a misty curtain to hide the antiquity of Malayalam Language,' the memorandum said and added that it was significant that Malayalam versions and commentaries of Sanskrit works were mentioned as ‘Tamil Kuttu' (Tamil book), an important example being the Malayalam annotation of the famous Sanskrit Lexicon, ‘Amarakosham' which was mentioned as ‘Amaram Tamill Kuttu'.The first available work in Malayalam, ‘Ramacharitham,' was proof of a rich heritage of poetic culture. Further, the present Malayalam script ‘Granthalipi' can be found in ancient Kerala writings from as far back as 9th century AD, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Panel-to-go-into-Keralas-appeal/article16298933.ece
102,State takes up NH issue with Manmohan,J. Balaji,2010-05-06,02:48:12 IST,"Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan led an all-party State delegation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh here on Wednesday and urged him to reduce the requirement for right of way (RoW) for National Highway (NH) development projects in the State to 30 metres from the proposed 45 metres.The delegation opposed the implementation of the projects in the State on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis as this would lead to collection of toll. The delegation wanted the Centre to invest in the NH projects directly. It sought adequate rehabilitation and resettlement packages for the evictees. They pointed out that in many stretches land was being acquired only on one side of the road and not in equal measures on either side. A width of 45 metres was too heavy a demand in a densely populated State like Kerala (with a population density of 819 per sq km). Moreover, religious institutions and historical monuments needed to be protected.Later, the Chief Minister told journalists that the Prime Minister had agreed to consider the request. He said that over 15 lakh people would get affected if the highways were expanded to 45 metres. There were lots of agitations and police actions which made the government to rethink on the subject after an all-party meet.Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy said the Congress, in principle, was not against the BOT package for NH 47 and NH 17. But the Centre had initially agreed to expand the highways with its own funds, he said.The delegates also urged the Centre to move the Supreme Court to get the stay given by the Karnataka High Court on night traffic on NH 67 and NH 212 connecting Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, vacated.Regarding the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, the delegates told the Prime Minister that though Kerala was committed to adopting the national pattern, it required some time. The Centre should extend funding to the State under the project without insisting on a change in the age of entry to school immediately. “As a transition management measure, the State may be allowed to convert Class I as pre-primary and the Centre may finance the expenses involved,” they said promising that in due course the age of entry would be changed to six.On the Kochi Metro project, the delegation sought early Central clearance with the participation of the Centre with the requisite external funding. They want this to be implemented on the Delhi metro formula and pointed out that the Centre need to spend only Rs.450 crore on the Kochi project.Among others, Ministers C. Divakaran, N.K. Premachandran, Jose Thettayil, Kadannappaly Ramachandran, K.P. Rajendran, M. Vijayakumar, and M.A. Baby, MPs M.I. Shanavas (Congress), Jose K. Mani (Kerala Congress-M) and E.T.

103,Luck by chance,Nita Sathyendran,2010-05-06,16:02:09 IST,"Deal or No Deal
  | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT I
n the few months since it has been on air, Surya TV's game show ‘Deal or No Deal' appears to have come up trumps for its exciting format, suspense factor, remarkable participants, glamorous models (who hold the cases with the money) and of course most of all, its affable host – actor Mukesh. ‘Deal or No Deal,' which recently completed 50 episodes and which airs on the weekends at 19.30, hinges on the decision-making ability of the contestants. The contestants have to figure out whether to call the deal offered by the banker or override the deal and continue playing for possible higher stakes. Mukesh, who is revelling in his second avatar as a game show host after his stint in ‘Kodeeswaran,' talks about the show to Friday Review. Excerpts from an interview…
Different formats of ‘Deal or No Deal' are aired in over 73 countries and perhaps in as many languages. What is different about the Malayalam version?
Apart from me, you mean? (Laughs). Just kidding. Actually, it is the participants who make the show the success that it is.They are simply superb. They are people with fascinating stories of life. They come from all walks of life – from fisher folk to teachers to scientists and what not, but what makes each of them so special is that they don't come here for the money or fame. Instead they come here to change their lives, change perspectives. For them winning money is secondary.
Change their lives, perspectives?
Well, for instance, in an episode there was a woman from Neyyatinkara who came on the show with her infant son with the hope that her missing/estranged husband would see the bubbly youngster and then want to come back home to them. Then again there was an 18-year-old who came on the show to request me to tell his father, a stonemason, that he (the father) should not spend his entire savings on alcohol.Likewise myriad such stories. The more I host the show the more I realise that it is all about human relationships.
What is your biggest challenge as the anchor?
Since there is a lot of one-to-one interaction between the contestants and myself, I have to constantly think on my feet. There is no script and you can never know what the contestants will ask/say. That's where my experience in mimicry, theatre, films and with life itself comes in handy.
How different is this stint as an anchor?
Being the host of ‘Kodeeswaran' gave me the confidence that I can do this one too. This time around, though, it is much more physically and mentally taxing.In ‘Kodeeswaran' I was comfortably ensconced in a chair asking predetermined questions and only crack a joke or two in between. Here I have to stand throughout the show and help contestants make their decisions on whether to deal or not to deal.
How do you help contestants make their decisions on something that appears to have more to do with luck than logic?
Actually luck only comes in the initial phase of the game. Once you go ahead its all about making the right decision at the right time. Of course, it is up to the contestant to deal or not to deal but I can be their support system and explain the pros and cons.

Thambidurai (AIADMK) said the Bill was brought with a political motive to accommodate some persons as it was sure that the AIADMK was going to capture power in Tamil Nadu in 2011 Assembly poll.He said the Council was a symbol of British legacy and its revival was a retrograde step.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Parliament-nod-for-Council-Bill/article16298959.ece

  Responding to a request from Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the Centre has allotted an additional 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice and 65,000 tonnes of wheat to the State.Replying to Peter Alphonse (Congress), Mr. Karunanidhi informed the Assembly on Thursday that he had made the request in the morning in New Delhi. “By the time I returned to Chennai in the evening, the order for the allotment had already reached Chennai.”Earlier, Food Minister E.V. Velu said the State normally received 2.96 lakh tonnes of rice from the Centre each month. Of this just over 65,000 tonnes was meant for distribution to Anthyodaya Anna Yojana families. This rice was supplied to Tamil Nadu at Rs.3 a kg. Another 1.04 lakh tonnes was given at Rs.5.65 a kg for Below Poverty Line families.For the remaining, the State paid Rs.8.35 a kg, which was the open market rate for rice supplied by the Centre (for 1.26 lakh tonnes). This was for above poverty line families. But, the intake had gone up, possibly because of the Re.1 a kg scheme of the government.The demand now stood at 3.17 lakh tonnes a month, he said, and added that this meant a significant deficit, which totalled to over 2.3 lakh tonnes per annum. The Centre had now allocated 2.5 lakh tonnes.Answering a question, Transport Minister K.N. Nehru said that the government was inclined to reduce the educational qualification for drivers from Class 10 to Class 8.

Directive to HCC
It has directed the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) to assess the value and feasibility of retaining the Bharath Insurance building. “As far as possible the building must be saved.The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and the Chennai Corporation, with the consultation of the HCC, shall issue directions for the protection of the building,” the judges said.The Bharath Insurance building, situated on Anna Salai, is an example of Indo-Saracenic architecture.Work on the construction of the building began in 1894 and it was inaugurated in 1897 as Kardyl Building, headquarters of ‘W.E.Smith & Co Ltd.'In 1934, it was sold to Bharath Insurance by Spencer's. Later, when life insurance was nationalised, the building and the company were taken over by the LIC.In 1998, the LIC initiated a process of eviction of tenants in the building on the grounds that it was unsafe for occupation due to its dilapidated condition.The HCC has been asked to recommend to the government steps to notify buildings listed by it as heritage buildings and within three months, cause notices to be issued to the concerned, especially the private owners, in respect of buildings listed by the Justice E.Padmanabhan committee so that there is no threat of demolition of destruction or alteration to such buildings.The Bench has asked the State government to issue rules to prevent persons from undertaking any repair, even in the name of renovation of heritage buildings without seeking the necessary approval of the HCC.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Restraint-on-demolition-of-heritage-building/article16298583.ece

The quantum of the judgement is to be pronounced on May 12.The carnage took place on the afternoon of July 11, 1996, when upper-caste landowners of the Ranvir Sena (a private militia of the landlords) stormed Bathani Tola in Bhojpur’s Sahar block and ruthlessly hacked 21 Dalits to death.The slain included women, teenage girls and babies less than 10 months old.An FIR was lodged against 33 people the day after the massacre. In all, the Bhojpur police framed charges against 63 persons in October 1996.The case was committed to the court of the Sessions judge on January 24, 1998, with charges being framed against 62 accused (one person had died by that time) on March 24, 2000.However, after the Central Bihar caste massacres violently concluded with the Mianpur carnage, the case against Brahmeshwar has been getting progressively murkier, with the police repeatedly failing to bring charges against the Mukhiya.Listed as an “absconder” by the Sahar police since 1996, no FIR, quite inexplicably, has ever been registered by the police against Brahmeshwar till date.The Mukhiya continues to be a non-FIR accused even after he was nabbed from Patna’s Exhibition road on August 29, 2002.While the government dithers on Brahmeshwar’s case fearing an upper-caste backlash this crucial election year, highly sceptical ponderings which surfaced soon after the Bathe verdict, are slowly turning into a cruel certainty in what is being constituted as “an open cover-up” on part of the government in Bhojpur judicial circles.“It is hard to fathom as to what is preventing the police and the government in bringing to book this criminal, who has been lodged in Ara jail since 2002,” said Special Public Prosecutor Mr. Rambabu Prasad, speaking to The Hindu from Ara. “This clearly shows that both the police and the government are not interested in ensuring that justice is meted out.”When questioned, the SP Bhojpur told this correspondent that Brahmeshwar did not stand trial as “certain court proceedings initiated against him were yet to be completed.”With the police’s failure to produce the “Butcher of Bathani Tola” in the Patna Sessions Court on April 7, a disturbing aspect of the case has been the repeated feigning of “confusion” on its part as to the status of Brahmeshwar’s investigation.The police has also conveniently the blamed the prosecution for failing to serve them notice regarding Brahmeshwar’s location.An absurd pretext, given that practically everyone in Bihar knows the Mukhiya to be safely ensconced in Ara jail for the last 8 years and counting.Meanwhile, Mr. Prasad said that he has filed a petition in the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Ara on April 19, urging the case against Brahmeshwar to be committed to the Sessions court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Prime-accused-absconding-23-convicted-in-Bathani-Tola-massacre-case/article16298833.ece
113,Jaipur hospital conducts successful bariatric surgery,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,20:03:21 IST,"Doctors at Fortis Escorts Hospital here have performed the first single-incision bariatric surgery in north India to treat a 31-year-old woman for obesity. The surgery for weight loss left only one scar and also treated the patient's related disorders such as acidity, insomnia, snoring and high cholesterol.Ajay Sharma, gastro-intestinal surgeon, said here on Thursday that the new laparoscopic surgery reduces the risks of infection, speeds up healing and helps reduce post-operative pain. The specialised surgical procedure was conducted here this past week for the first time in any northern State.A few attempts made for the single-incision surgery in Delhi had earlier failed. Dr. Sharma said the surgical technique required surgeons to learn specialised skills to perform the operation through a solitary incision against four or more in the traditional surgery, in which each incision has the potential to become infected and cause pain.Dr. Sharma said the woman patient weighed 98 kg and her body mass index (BMI) was 41 against 27 for a normal person. She did not get any relief from the regular yoga, diet control and fat loss medicines consumed for quite some time.Doctors at the hospital conducted tests such as sonography, liver function, thyroid and hormone profiles on the woman and concluded that her obesity could be controlled by bariatric surgery. A single 2.5-mm incision was made in the abdomen during the operation and the patient fully recovered within three days without any stitch marks or scars.Besides the removal of fat in the minimally invasive surgery, a portion of the stomach was detached to decrease the food intake and reduce the release of hormones responsible for deposition of fat. Dr. Sharma said the woman lost seven kg within 12 days and resumed her daily routine.The single-incision surgery was earlier performed at Fortis Escorts Hospital for gallbladder, appendix and hernia. Dr. Sharma said more weight loss surgeries though single-incision had been planned during this month after the first successful bariatric operation.Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gradually gaining ground in several other areas of medicine as well. For the obese people, the procedure leads to long-term loss of weight, recovery from diabetes, improvement in cardiovascular risk factors and a reduction in mortality.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Jaipur-hospital-conducts-successful-bariatric-surgery/article16298832.ece
114,INLD accuses Hooda Govt. of trying to influence voters,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,20:02:14 IST,"Even as 1,371 nomination papers were filed till Wednesday for the general municipal elections in Haryana due on May 20, the Indian National Lok Dal on Thursday condemned the “brazen manner'' in which the Haryana Government was “trying to influence the voters''.INLD spokesperson K.C. Bangar said the party had urged the State Election Commissioner Dharam Vir to “intervene and uphold the Model Code of Conduct to ensure free and fair elections''.Dr. Bangar alleged that the State Government was “posting certain officials owing allegiance to the ruling party in key positions''. The INLD had drawn the attention of the election office to the fact that with the notification for holding the municipal elections on May 20 issued on April 26, the Code of Conduct had become immediately effective. Therefore no transfer of officials should have been made after the notification without the approval of the Election Commission.However, the Government had transferred O.P. Sheoran, Deputy Commissioner of Palwal, to Hisar as Deputy Commissioner. Dr. Bangar said this “transfer became even more critical in view of the fact that only a few days earlier Mr. Sheoran had been transferred from Hisar to Palwal. The latest transfer orders after the notification of the elections are obviously motivated with the intention of favouring the ruling party and also vitiating the peaceful atmosphere of Hisar''.He charged that in the past too the Bhupinder Singh Hooda regime had been misusing government funds to further the interests of the ruling party. This practice of using government machinery and funds continued unabated in view of the municipal elections. He accused the State Public Relations Department of “releasing advertisements to various magazines and journals with the intention of winning support during the polls''.The INLD has urged the State Election Commissioner to seek a report on all the advertisements that had been released by the Public Relations Department after the elections were notified and urged him to stop such release of funds immediately.The party has also brought to the notice of the State Election Commissioner a public notice published in a newspaper on May 5 informing the public that the Transport Department would issue 1,714 new permits and launch 860 new routes.The spokesman said this was a serious violation of the model code .The Election Commission has also been apprised of enrolment of bogus voters in Kurukshetra and Faridabad and action has been sought against the Deputy Commissioners/ Municipal Commissioners as the case may be.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/INLD-accuses-Hooda-Govt.-of-trying-to-influence-voters/article16298831.ece

116,Dantewada operation was ‘thoughtlessly’ planned: Chidambaram,PTI,2010-05-06,15:44:54 IST,"Home Minister P. Chidambaram has said the Dantewada operation, in which 76 CRPF personnel were massacred by Maoists last month, was planned “thoughtlessly” by top officials of the force there.“I was heartbroken after Dantewada (where 76 personnel were killed on April 6). I did not lose my nerve. I have no fear of Naxalites. One IG, two DIGs and an SP, thoughtlessly without planning, sent 76 troops for recce,” Mr. Chidambaram said, addressing students at a seminar in the Jawaharlal Nehru University, here on Wednesday nightHe said the setback meant that the country was confronting an adversary who is organised in strength.Later talking about developmental issues, Mr. Chidambaram said, “Dantewada has a police station which has only two policemen. When a policeman does not want to go there, how can you expect a teacher or a BDO to go there.”The Minister said that extreme ideology can be propagated in India. “Speech and propagation is free in a democracy but when they take up arms, the conflict arises.”He said there was no confusion about the aim of the Naxals. “The aim is seizure of political power with armed struggle. That is acceptable under certain conditions. Countries under colonialism took this path. Even India saw armed struggle to overthrow British.“There are situations when you are agitated or frustrated. I represent a backward constituency. Development has just started pouring in. If everybody has a justified right to take up arms, what will happen to the country?”He said the debate regarding whether development or police action should take place first in naxal-affected areas is “metaphysical.”“In West Midnapore, police action is needed first. In Gadchiroli, the district has been secured by security forces. Orissa is in a mixed stage, we have progressed in Jharkhand. It is a chicken and egg argument.“Maoists know development is a threat to them, so they demolish schools, 71 schools were blown up in 2009, they mine roads and blow up bridges. Villagers are killed in the name of being informers.... So to say Maoists are pro-development is a very naive argument,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Dantewada-operation-was-lsquothoughtlesslyrsquo-planned-Chidambaram/article16298795.ece

Thakur said that separate police teams had been deployed at rail stations and bus stands as security measures were intensified in the wake of the shutdown.Railway sources further said that all long distance trains will be escorted by pilot trains while directives had been issued to limit the speed of express and mail trains to 75 Km/hr.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/Maoists-damage-rail-tracks-burn-buses-in-north-Bihar/article16298830.ece

122,Super Eight: England beat Pakistan by six wickets,S. Dinakar,2010-05-06,22:50:17 IST,"England's Kevin Pietersen, left, is congratulated by teammate Tim Bresnan after he took the catch to dismiss Pakistan's batsman Umar Akmal during their Twenty20 Cricket World Cup match in Bridgetown on Thursday.
  Kevin Pietersen is light on his feet and heavy with his strokes. He waltzed at the crease here on Thursday with shots that were both graceful and inventive.The smooth-stroker was unbeaten with a 52-ball 73 as England won the first Super Eights duel of the ICC World Twenty20 by six wickets with three deliveries to spare.Chasing 148 after inserting Pakistan, England, guided by Pietersen's brilliance, managed to nail a potentially hazardous chase on a lively pitch. The innings was well-paced; only two runs were required in the final over.Earlier, paceman Stuart Broad and left-arm spinner Michael Yardy impressed as Pakistan was pegged back when poised for a surge. England, however, was let off the hook by Pakistan's sloppy catching.Saeed Ajmal grassed a regulation offering at mid-on after appearing to have the ball in control to reprieve opener Craig Kieswetter (on zero) off paceman Abdul Razzaq. Then, Ajmal put down Michael Lumb (on 23), left-arm speedster Mohammed Aamer being the bowler to suffer.And Razzaq failed to latch on to a return catch when Pietersen was on 21. It proved a costly lapse.After Kieswetter and the more fluent Lumb had powered England to a strong start - the openers put on 44 in 5.4 overs - Pietersen took charge.Crucially, he forced the Pakistani bowlers to alter their length. He danced down the track to convert the length to drive, loft, flick and glance both the pacemen and the spinners.He won the crucial duel against leg-spinner Shahid Afridi; the on-the-walk strike over cover reflected his urge to dominate. The manner in which Pietersen, using his feet, clipped Afridi displayed his balance and timing.Indeed, Pietersen was at his fluent best. The lofted six over long off - against the spin - off off-spinner Ajmal was high on the scale of difficulty.Paul Collingwood batted smartly, rotating the strike. England lost its skipper and Eoin Morgan towards the end but then Pietersen had inflicted too much damage for his side to be in any trouble.Earlier, Pakistan started in an emphatic manner with Kamran Akmal pulling the first ball of the match - from left-armer Ryan Sidebottom - over the ropes.The dangerous Akmal dazzled briefly before Broad, extracting good bounce from the pitch, consumed the batsman on the hook. Meanwhile, the left-handed Salman Butt, drove, sliced and flicked to the delight of the Pakistani supporters. Off-spinner Graeme Swann, a quality bowler, deceived Butt in the flight to terminate a promising innings.Yardy, quicker through the air with his left-arm spin, took out Mohammed Hafeez with a change of pace.Off the very next ball – it was the 11th over of the innings – Afridi set out for a non-existent single to cover only to be sent back by Umar Akmal. The Pakistan captain could not regain his crease. England had struck a body blow.Umar Akmal, a naturally free-stroking batsman, produced a few sparkling shots but Pakistan continued to lose wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq fell to an attempted reverse sweep off Yardy. And Umar fell to a sensational catch from Pietersen at deep mid-wicket when he attempted to muscle a short ball from Sidebottom. Pietersen, running with his back to the ball, anticipated to perfection.It was his afternoon at the Kensington Oval. Pietersen was rightly adjudged Man of the Match.

Brief Scores:

Pakistan: 147 for nine in 20 overs (Salman Butt 34, Umar Akmal 30; Michael Yardy 2/19, Stuart Broad 2/25, Ryan Sidebottom 2/28).England: 148 for four in 19.3 overs (Kevin Pietersen 70 not out, Michael Lumb 25, Craig Kieswetter 25; Saeed Ajmal 2/15).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Super-Eight-England-beat-Pakistan-by-six-wickets/article16299035.ece
123,"India, Australia set for Super Eights showdown",S. Dinakar,2010-05-06,20:38:19 IST,"A confident India face a stern test when they square up against Australia in their first Super Eights clash in the World Twenty20.
  The ball flew around at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday. There was good carry for the pacemen and the bounce assisted the spin bowlers too.This suggests strong back-footed players who can unleash the horizontal bat shots and those with hands that can harness the pace on the ball could be among the runs at the famous Kensington Oval.The venue that oozes character - cricket is very much in the air in these parts - will be the stage for the crucial Super Eights clash between India and Australia on Friday.The cricketers will not be short of inspiration. The immortal Garfield Sobers enclosure stands sentinel over the ground. It will be a big game for both sides. The side, which loses the first match will, in all probability, be under tremendous pressure to win its next two encounters.Much could hinge on how the Indian top-order fares against the Australian pace battery. If Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes can be prevented from making the early inroads, India can win.Tait and Nannes form the quickest new ball combination in the competition. This is a pair of contrasts that blends well. Tait, the high velocity slinger, complements Nannes, the sharp and skiddy left-armer.Will the influential Mitchell Johnson recovers in time from an elbow injury to his non-bowling right arm. If Johnson does not play, Ryan Harris, deceptively quick, will retain his place.The Aussie gameplan will be simple - use the short-pitched deliveries to disrupt the footwork of the Indian batsmen.Tait and Nannes are likely to rely on short-pitched stuff - while only one bouncer per over is allowed, the paceman can bowl any number of deliveries that forces the batsmen to fend off rib-cage – and push the men facing them to the back-foot.They can then strike with searing yorkers. This is a ploy that has worked against India in the past. Once the Aussies score early, then the spinners, including leggie Steven Smith, could be able to bowl under less stress.In a morning match – the game starts at 9.30 a.m. local time – toss will be a factor. The side that bowls first – there will be some moisture on the surface – could starts with an advantage.Openers Gautam Gambhir and Murali Vijay, a left-right pair, face a daunting task. However, the fact that both of them can play the cut and the pull might enable them to counter-attack. Yes, the Indian batsmen will have to disrupt the length of the Aussie pacemen.The in-form Suresh Raina and his ability vis a vis the short-pitched stuff will be under the scanner. He has to remove the question mark against his name when it comes to a particular form of attack. He occupies the vital No. 3 slot.Yuvraj Singh can meet fire with fire, respond with furious hooks and pulls. The mercurial left-hander appears to be getting his confidence back.India has depth in its ranks with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni capable of orchestrating remarkable turnarounds. Yusuf Pathan can strike the ball hard and long too but he could be probed with a barrage of short-pitched deliveries.Australia, though, lacks a specialist fifth bowler. The Indians would be looking at an opportunity here. The Indian bowlers will be in with a definite chance on this surface.Australia has firepower in its batting but then its top and middle-order came apart against Bangladesh before the cool and calculative Michael Hussey came up with a worthy innings under adverse circumstances.For India, left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan should be back in the attack and the bounce will enhance his cut off the wicket. Ashish Nehra, another left-armer, has been bowling a mean length at the death.Bowling in the end overs has been an area of concern for the Indians but Nehra has been operating with heart and tact.And Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla could pose searching questions to the Aussie line-up. The spinners could be among the wickets as well.The wicket of the imposing Shane Watson would the key strike for India at the top of the order. If Watson thrives with his big drives and pulls, India could be in real trouble.India suffered an injury setback when paceman Praveen Kumar was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament with an abdominal tear. Praveen will be replaced by Vidarbha paceman Umesh Yadav.

My conscience would not allow me to come back if I knew within myself I had done something wrong,” Samuels was quoted as saying in Sydney Morning Herald.“They (ICC) need to spend time on situations like this; it is delicate and very important because you are dealing with players’ careers.”“When they looked at my case, they used me as a scapegoat, the ICC wanted to make an example out of me when I was never in a position for them to be able to use me as an example. The way they dealt with my case was very unfair,” he said.“I really didn’t have a case; when I went to the hearing I thought it would be just a fair process but it wasn’t like a hearing at all, I was just banned.”Samuels was charged with playing a part in fixing the first One-day international between India and the West Indies in Nagpur January 21, 2007. The allegations led to the ICC asking the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to conduct an investigation.At the disciplinary hearing, the committee considered evidence provided by the ICC’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) and excerpts of a recorded telephone conversation between Samuels and alleged bookie Mukesh Kochchar, which detailed vital match information being leaked by Samuels.Samuels was accused of leaking information like pitch conditions, the West Indies batting order and team strategies.The 29-year-old won’t predict if or when he might appear for the West Indies again but says: “I’ll just let my bat do the talking.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/I-was-made-a-scapegoat-by-ICC-Samuels/article16298789.ece

We will see how it goes tomorrow,” Clarke said.India have a flock of spinners in Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja and part-timers Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh who have proved effective in the past.The Aussie skipper though feels that spin bowling would play a big role in the tournament but sees equal opportunities for the fast bowlers and spinners as far as Friday’s clash is concerned.“Spin bowling is going to play a big part in the tournament. We saw in our win against Bangladesh that the spinners turned the ball a bit. So we can anticipate captains use their spin bowlers more often in the Twenty20 format.“The wicket here is good and the ground is wonderful. It is a lot different from the one we played in St. Lucia. But the nature of the wicket would be of no consequence as the result of the match depends on how the bowlers bowl and how the batters bat.“It depends on how the bowlers use the conditions and execute their skills. So, we are not thinking too about the wicket right now,” averred Clarke, adding “a score of 140 to 150 was defendable.”Clarke was satisfied with his team’s performance in the group matches, where Australia kept a clean slate by beating Pakistan and Bangladesh.“In the last two games we have done pretty well. We came back into the match against Bangladesh after losing six wickets for nothing. We are enjoying our cricket at the moment.Clarke said his boys were ready for the showdown in the Super Eights.“We have trained hard and our preparation has been spot on. We will focus on one match at a time and do not want to look too far into the future. We want to keep our game simple and not worry too much about what India could do,” he said.He did not rule out Mitchell Johnson, who missed the game against Bangladesh with a sore elbow, from Friday’s match.“The physio has been working on him. We will take a call on him tomorrow. But I think we have found a good replacement for him in Ryan Harris,” said Clarke.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/We-can-handle-Indian-spinners-Clarke/article16298732.ece
127,"Australia beat Bangladesh by 27 runs, qualify for Super 8s",PTI,2010-05-06,01:42:10 IST,"Australia produced a clinical performance to beat Bangladesh by 27 runs and qualify for the Super Eight stage of the Twenty20 cricket World Cup here today.The Aussies rode on Michael Hussey’s unbeaten 47 and Dirk Nannes’ four-wicket haul to drew curtains on their group campaign on unbeaten note after having defeated title holders Pakistan by 34 runs in their opening match.Australia now join Pakistan from Group A in the Super Eight stage and will take on India in their opening second round encounter on Friday.Michael Hussey played a sweet little cameo and shared crucial 74 runs with Steven Smith (27 off 18) for the seventh wicket to lift Australia to 141 for seven before Nannes (4/18) produced a breathtaking pace bowling display toNannes was ably supported by David Hussey (2/8) and Smith (2/29) at the middle.Captain Shakib Al Hasan top—scored for Bangladesh with a run-a-ball 28 while wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim (24 off 25) gave him the perfect support from the other end during their 48-run fifth-wicket partnership.Bangladesh made a mockery of their run chase as they lost four of their top-order batsmen inside the first four overs.Needing a outright win inside 19 overs to book their place in the Super Eight stage, the Bangladesh’s did not help their cause in any way and played insensible shots against some fine pace bowling to totter at 16 for four.Shain Tait (1/15)) and Nannes tested the Bangladeshi batters from the onset with their fiery and high quality fast bowling.Nannes, in particular, was the fiercesome of the duo as he picked up Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed and Mahmudullah during his three-over opening spell before returning back to account for the wicket Jahurul Islam (18).Inspite of the early jitters, Shakib and Mushfiqur put up a brave fight during their the fifth wicket to keep Bangladesh in the hunt.Shakib’s innings was finally cut short by a blinder of a catch at deep from Michael Hussey off Smith.Jahurul and Shafiul Islam (16 off 13) tried their level best to dig something out of the game but it was not to be Bangladesh’s day as Australia dished out a fantastic performance on the field to eventually romp home with eight balls to spare.Earlier opting to bat, the Aussies initially struggled as they lost six wickets for mere 65 runs before Hussey and Smith saved the day with the 42-ball vital partnership.After the initial hiccup, the Aussies added 59 runs in the last five overs, courtesy some fine hitting from Hussey and Smith.Australia did not have the ideal start to their innings as Shane Watson (4) feel early with Mashrafe Mortaza (2/28) striking in his second and innings’ third over.Watson mistimed a pull of Mortaza’s well-directed bouncer that landed in the hands of Ahmed.Captain Shakib (2/24) then ensured double celebrations for Bangladesh in the next over, picking up dangerman David Warner (16 off 11), caught by Ahmed.And then few overs later, a reckless shot from Brad Haddin ensured further trouble for Australia. He was easily caught by Shafiul off left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak (1/29) as he went for a lofted sweep over square leg.As if that was not enough, skipper Michael Clarke (16) was the next to depart, caught at long-off boundary by Jahurul off Ashraful (1/24) to see Australia stutter at 54 for four at the halfway mark.It could have been more trouble the Aussies had Jahurul not dropped a David Hussey sitter off Ashraful’s next ball.But Mortaza ensured that Bangladesh did not have to pay heavily for the dropped chance, picking up David Hussey in the next over to mark the departure of half of the Aussie side.Another well-directed bouncer from Mortaza hurried David Hussey into the pull, but the batsman could not control the shot and ballooned it to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur.Cameron White too failed to make any impact as Shakib outsmarted him with a lovely leg-spinner that turned away crashed onto his timbers.With chips down, Michael Hussey and Smith first played sensibly with ones and twos before opening up in the final five overs to take Australia to the fighting total.Michael Hussey took the onus on him to guide the Australia innings and picked up the tempo with a 17-run over off Mortaza. He hit as many as four fours and six during his 29-bal unbeaten stay.Smith too was not far behind as he used his long handle to great affect in the dying stages to register two sixes and a boundary against his name.

Brief Scores:

Australia: 141 for seven in 20 overs (Michael Hussey 47, Steven Smith 27; Mashrafe Mortaza 2/28, Shakib Al Hasan 2/24).Bangladesh: 114 all out in 18.4 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 28, Mushfiqur Rahim 24; Dirk Nannes 4/18).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Australia-beat-Bangladesh-by-27-runs-qualify-for-Super-8s/article16298627.ece
128,Ardour for going abroad for higher studies still in vogue,Amutha Kannan,2010-05-06,00:34:58 IST,"Students interacting with a representative of a foreign university at 'The Hindu Education Plus International Education Fair 2010' in Coimbatore on Wednesday. Photo:K.Ananthan.
  | Photo Credit: K_Ananthan With campus placements improving and the economy looking up in the “spill-over” days of the recession, one would have thought that those who are about to start their undergraduate course will be happy about this trend and go with the flow.But, the student crowd that thronged The Hindu Education Plus Education Fair 2010, held for the first time in Coimbatore on Wednesday, told an entirely different story. Even with fairly good jobs and quality education in India, the 2,500-odd visitors to the fair stood testimony to the fact that studying abroad still remained a craze.Though the favourites of the day were Information Technology, engineering, biotechnology, management, and animation, there were universities and academies offering courses from dance and aviation to medicine and health studies, which too drew many enquiries. Of the 2,500, there were more than 1,200 students who registered, showing their earnestness about the course and university they were interested in.For such an enthusiastic turnout, the fair with 30-odd stalls comprising universities, educational consultants, and a bank, turned out to be a boon, offering options with many countries, universities, and courses, to choose from. Students and parents had to wait their turn at each stall to talk to representatives.A parent said she had to talk to representatives in most of the stalls because all the participants were genuine and not institutions which were of run-of-the-mill quality.The University of Bradford, the U.K., with its bachelors, masters' and research programmes in health studies, informatics, and life sciences, Birmingham City University, the U.K., with its job-ready vocational programmes in automotive, and mechanical engineering, and Stratford University, the U.S., with its special focus on telecommunications and software engineering, were a big draw.University of Alabama, Huntsville, the U.S., was promoting the two five-year integrated programmes for undergraduates – Mechanical Aerospace Engineering, and Business Management. Representatives of RACUS, a private organisation representing Russian State universities, said the universities were offering medical and dental courses for 20 per cent of the total fee. “The Russian Government bears 80 per cent of the fee for international students,” Maria Postolovskaya, said. Hence, a candidate with only 50 per cent aggregate and with no GRE score could do a course in medicine, dentistry, business management, or engineering, in a Russian State university.Just like any other stall, eager parents swarmed the stall put up by State Bank of India (SBI) keen to know about the education loans available for students going abroad.S. Venkataraman, Regional Manager, Region I, SBI, said for students going abroad the loan amount went up to Rs. 20 lakh at 11.75 per cent interest. “This will be given against a collateral. Students get a grace period of a year on completion of the course. After that they are given a seven-year repayment period,” he said. Many walked out with the options they needed to make the right decisions to join the bandwagon of Indians studying abroad.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Ardour-for-going-abroad-for-higher-studies-still-in-vogue/article16298590.ece

Radhakrishnan,2010-05-06,00:33:28 IST,"Known for being steeped in tradition and history, the Lawrence School at Lovedale near here became a trend setter of sorts on Wednesday.The institution set in motion its three-day 152nd Founder's Day celebrations with a programme aimed at de-stressing not only its students and faculty but also parents and visitors.The programme, facilitated by a Bangalore-based group involved a ‘Drum Jam' session, which, apart from breaking barriers, set the tone for the celebrations in which the former Governor of West Bengal Gopal Gandhi will be participating as the chief guest on the concluding day.The head of the group Roberto Narain told The Hindu that such a programme was being organized for the first time in the Nilgiris.Earlier an exhibition was inaugurated by the President of the Old Lawrencians Association M.S.P.Senthil Kumar.Among those present were the Headmaster Y.H.V.S.Prasad and Bursar C.Sunderaj.A highlight was an eco model house put together by the Science Department.The school which ranks as one of the leading public schools in this part of the world came into being in 1858.Situated amidst sylvan surroundings, the school, which sprawls over about 700 acres, has had a chequered history.Started as an asylum thanks to the efforts of a soldier and civil administrator Sir Henry Lawrence, it was converted into a military school and made a public school after Independence.However the tragedy was that Sir Henry did not live to see his work come to fruition, having died on July 4, 1857 in the Lucknow Mutiny.Before being christened The Lawrence School, it has over the years been referred to as the Ootacamund Lawrence Asylum, the Lawrence Memorial School and the Lawrence Memorial Royal Military School.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Founders-Day-begins-with-drum-jam-session/article16298588.ece

132,"Water supply erratic, say residents",Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,00:30:15 IST,"Residents of T.N. Chinnaswamy Avenue in Ward 1 of the Coimbatore Corporation say they are going the worst time yet in terms of drinking water supply under the Pilloor scheme for over two months.The layout is among the many that fall under the North and East zones of the Corporation that are struggling for water.Official sources say that with the bulk of the city's new regularised layouts located in these zones, the residential colonies have been pushed into a phase of scarcity from that of abundance.The areas coming under the Pilloor scheme were envied by those in the Siruvani scheme areas because the former enjoyed a sustained allocation of 65 million litres a day throughout the year. But, the monsoon determined the quantity of supply in the Siruvani areas.But, the residents in Wards 1 and 2 say that water adequacy was a thing of the past. Now, it is a tough struggle.“Every day, at least 10 women walk to the Corporation's overhead tank near our colony in a desperate search for water,” says secretary of T.N. Chinnaswamy Avenue Welfare Association K. Ramachandran.Ward 1 councillor K. Chandrasekar says: “It 13 days (till May 4) since we got water supply. When we take this up with the Corporation water supply staff or officials, they cite power shutdown as the reason. Three hours of power cut has a direct effect on the areas where water has to be pumped to from the water tank.”Ward 2 councillor D. Jothimani too has a similar complaint. “We get water only once in 10 days,” she says. “And, there is no solution to this problem though we have taken it up with the water supply wing of the civic body.”Mr. Chandrasekar wonders how Avarampalayam gets water once in five days and not Wards 1 and 2 that were not very far away.Mr. Ramachandran says the residents are even more upset with the water supply staff for not informing of the probable supply time.“The supply is made at 11 p.m. If we know of this in advance, we can stay awake. Otherwise, we will never know of the supply.”Even in the case of disruption in Pilloor supply because of problems in the supply line such as leaks of bursts, the residents say that they should know when the supply will be restored in their respective layouts after the supply in the main line is restored.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Water-supply-erratic-say-residents/article16298584.ece

Stating that this was the first public interaction on the issue and a lot of inputs were received, she said, “I am in favour of another round.''Ms. Dikshit said all the suggestions would be considered in setting up a mechanism in which the Delhi Government would have a role in various aspects of policing. “It is all about how better we can serve Delhi, which is widely perceived as not a safe city,'' she said.The Chief Minister said the reasons for crime in Delhi are many including its porous borders. But since it is a special city being the Capital of the country and has a large diplomatic corps, there is a strong need to modernise the force. Also, she said, a department is needed within the Delhi Police for social service-oriented work and for identifying and rectifying problems that affect the society.The conference was attended by a number of Delhi Ministers, BJP MLA Sahab Singh Chauhan, Chief Secretary Rakesh Mehta, Union Home Secretary G.K. Pillai, Principal Secretary (Home) G.S. Patnaik, Commissioner of Delhi Police Y.S.

138,Taking the eco-friendly path,M. Sai Gopal,2010-05-06,00:25:31 IST,"A common plastic pipe used to drain out water morphs into a stunning village belle. A multipurpose galvanised iron wire now stands tall as a farmer with a plough on his shoulders. At another corner of the wall, a piece of thermocol has been turned into an exquisite clay model of Radha-Krishna, imitating art on wood complete with fine engravings.The clay used to mould these three-dimensional figures is unique. Unlike normal clay models, which develop cracks, do not have solidity and need to be ‘fired' in a kiln, this clay does not require any special treatment.To top it off, it is eco-friendly and no chemicals have been used in its preparation.The studio of artist K. Muralidhar at Sindhi Colony has loads of such astonishing clay models, moulded by using things which are usually discarded to a bust-bin.The empty box of a talcum powder now has a clay face on it and can be used as a paperweight. A used towel has been expertly moulded, by using the clay, into wavy curls of a woman.“Such artwork is usually done with plaster of Paris, cement or adhesives like an M.seal”. Normal clay does not bind and cracks develop immediately. I have prepared this eco-friendly clay without any chemicals. The colours being used in the artwork are also natural,” says Muralidhar.To prove the environment friendly nature of his clay, Muralidhar grows decorative plants at his art studio, by using the clay, in small pots. The artist has done lot of research on how to prevent clay models from developing cracks, make them light weight and without using furnace or a kiln to heat.“I have used grounded cotton powder to prevent cracks and wood powder to make clay light in weight,” he reveals. The clay is soluble and artworks can be recycled by dipping in water. “If you are not happy by the finished artwork, just dip it in water and start again,” he says.

139,"3,000 habitations face water scarcity",B. Chandrashekhar,2010-05-06,00:24:08 IST,"The drinking water situation in rural areas across the State is alarming due to depletion of water availability and drying up of sources.Authorities of the Rural Water Supply Department admit that about 38 lakh people in nearly 3,000 habitations, mostly in Telangana region, are facing drinking water scarcity.Some district Collectors, at whose disposal the State government has kept sufficient funds to tie over the situation, have been found wanting in taking the call to meet the demand in several districts. As a result, people in most of the affected habitations are being forced to manage with a meagre supply of 15 litres per capita per day (LPCD) against the WHO-standard requirement of 40 LPCD.“The WHO norm means water requirement of a person for all his needs in a day. But, we (RWS Department) are supplying water only for drinking and cooking needs”, officials of the department argued. Summer has put severe stress on water sources resulting in 154 protected water supply schemes becoming defunct and 15,009 borewells getting seasonal.When contacted, Deputy Chief Engineer of RWS B. Surender Reddy told The Hindu on Tuesday that drinking water was being transported to 2,939 habitations as on May 4 due to shortfall in yield (1,091), drying up and depletion in the water quality (1,831) and power supply problem (17). Need of 1,831 habitations was being met by hiring private sources like agricultural borewells.Shortfall in water yield in sources was high in Chittoor (374 habitations), Karimnagar (115), Srikakulam (110), Adilabad (81), Krishna (65), Kadapa (53), Warangal (46), Medak (41), Nizamabad (39) and Khammam (31), whereas drying up of sources and depletion in quality was more in Warangal (902), Chittoor (499), Nalgonda (310), Karimnagar (282), Medak (151), Adilabad (132), Nizamabad (119), Kadapa (117), Srikakulam (113) and Khammam (71), he explained.Shortage of staff has also become a bottleneck in meeting the demand in some districts like Nizamabad, where only 15 per cent of the sanctioned strength was available. Of the a sum of Rs. 57.53 crore released to Collectors for taking up contingency measures in scarcity habitations only Rs.16,67 crore has been utilised so far. Besides, Rs. 25 lakh each legislators' ACDP fund has also been allocated for the purpose.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3000-habitations-face-water-scarcity/article16298578.ece
140,Bringing back a cultural metaphor,J. S. Ifthekhar,2010-05-06,00:22:50 IST,"Years roll back and time seems to stand still. Hyderabad's founder, Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, reclines on his throne with the royal guards in attendance. The poets are seated in a semi-circle on spotless white ‘chandnees'. The air is rife with expectation as the ‘shama' is placed before a poet.Yes, one is transported back in time as a typical mushaira of the Quli Qutb Shah days comes alive. Mushairas figure at the top on the cultural calendar of Hyderabad, but this one is different. It is a throwback to the olden times when aesthetic values had not yielded place to crass commercialisation.An earnest attempt was made the other day by artistes belonging to “Aiwan-e-Fankar” to bring back the glory of mushairas of yore. They tried to trace the journey of the ‘ghazal', capturing the typical ambience, the rich blend of thought and feelings. Not just this. Artistes donned period costumes complete with flowing beards and long tresses to play the roles of great poets like Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Daag, Jigar, Hasrat Mohani down to the recent greats like Shaz Tamkanat and Maqdoom Mohiuddin.For most part, the history of Urdu poetry is the story of the Urdu ghazal. But the current generation brought up on MTV has neither the taste nor interest to appreciate the nuances of shayari. “We want to present the greatest of Urdu poets in their original style. And also to show how mushairas were actually held earlier,” says Javeed Kamal, the man behind ‘Tamseeli mushaira'.Sure, this is a fairly good attempt to revive interest in the institution of mushaira. Interestingly, it seeks to treat the audience with the best of Urdu ghazals from the best writers of the genre. Mr. Kamal has shot the two-hour concert and it will be soon available in CD format. Urdu lovers can now watch the legendary poets recite from the comfort of their homes.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Bringing-back-a-cultural-metaphor/article16298576.ece

142,Traumatic moments for kin of rag-pickers,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,00:20:12 IST,"As four poclains rummaged through the mountains of garbage at the Jawaharnagar dumping yard, rag-picker Shanmuga sat there silently praying that his son is found alive.His son, Vaasu, along with two others, Khaja, 15, and Mohd. Raheem, 22, got buried alive under the heaps of garbage three days ago. Shanmuga believed that some miracle would bring back his son alive. His hopes were shattered as a poclain operator stumbled upon a severed body.Families of the three victims ran there to see who it was. Shanmuga collapsed on seeing that the severed body was that of his son, recognising it by the colour of the trousers and innerwear that he last wore.“Probably, the huge steel hook of the poclain hit the body severing it,” the police said. Vaasu was the only son of Shanmuga. His mother died few years ago. Theirs was one of the nearly 100 rag-picking families living near the yard, picking plastic from garbage and selling it for recycling.Shanmuga cried inconsolably on seeing his son's body refusing to leave the place till his son's head was found. The police sent him away convincing him that searches in the night would not be helpful. Family members of Raheem and Khaja too underwent equally tense moments as the bodies of their beloved ones could not be traced.Sania, wife of Raheem, went to Moosarambagh on Monday to see her ailing mother when she learnt that her husband got trapped in the garbage. They got married a year ago. The shell-shocked woman sat at the yard as searches continued for the last two days.Officials restricted rag-pickers from entering the dumping yard when a rag-picking woman, Nagamma, 42, died after heaps of garbage fell on her 10 days ago. “This meant no work and no food for us. Apparently, my son Khaja was worried about the family's fate and ventured into the yard in the night looking for plastic along with the other two,” Khaja's mother Sabera Begum said.

143,EAMCET: certificate verification to begin early,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,00:19:17 IST,"Officials are toying with the idea of verifying the certificates of EAMCET aspirants soon after the results are released instead of waiting till the actual process of counselling starts.The idea is to cut down the time and ensure that certification is not done in a hurry. This year the announcement of final ranks is likely to be delayed and done only in the second week of July. Officials want to announce the results taking into consideration the marks obtained in the re-verification of scripts and recounting of marks obtained in the advanced supplementary examinations.Officials said since verification of certificates has nothing to do with ranks obtained they want to advance the process. Last year, verification was done in 59 helpline centres across the State, and this year the number may be increased as new centres have been added in two more districts.If a final decision is taken the process is likely to start in June second week after the marks of EAMCET are announced.

  | Photo Credit: G_Karthikeyan With effective intervention of government hospitals and good support and coordination from the NGOs and Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres, the rate of spreading of HIV among people had come down to 0.025 per cent from 1.36 per cent, said T. Jayabal, Joint Director of Health Services.He was addressing an AIDS awareness seminar meant for HIV affected persons, nurses and volunteers held here on Wednesday.Approximately four million people have been living with HIV in the world including in African countries, top in the world in having highest number of HIV patients. India's position was number two in this list but it was number one in controlling the disease.Dindigul district alone had over 8,000 persons living with HIV. Only 3,411 patients had registered with Anti-Retroviral Therapy Centre of which 1,678 patients got regular treatment. Besides, 89 children too were also treated at the ART centre, Dr. Jayabal pointed out. The Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society had offered Rs.1.38 lakh to meet their educational needs, he added.He appealed to all persons living with HIV to register their names with the ART centre and avail its care and support services. The non-governmental organisations, volunteers and village health nurses should strive hard to include those who had not registered their names with the ART centre.Early detection of HIV, prompt diagnosis and treatment would certainly ensure reduction of morbidity and mortality of the infected and quality of life of the affected could also be improved. Effective management of the disease would also help delay the progression of the disease. The ART centre in Dindigul GH had all facilities and equipments required to test the patients. Patients need not go to Madurai for diagnosis and tests. The GH had even a legal cell for AIDS patients to protect their rights, he added.In his special address, Tamil Nadu Health System Project Coordinator A. Asai Thambi said that persons aged below 50 years alone were mostly affected by AIDS. Weakening the youth population will have a direct impact on the economic development and growth of the nation, he added.Speakers stated that HIV cases were on the rise in Oddanchatram, Nilakottai and Batlagundu.

146,High Court staff see light at the end of the tunnel,Mohamed Imranullah S.,2010-05-06,02:23:22 IST,"Madras High Court employees here demanded an exclusive housing colony in 2004; works for identifying the land began in 2005 and officials zeroed in on a 3.7-acre site opposite to the Maatuthavani Integrated bus terminus in 2006.Thereafter, a building plan was drawn in 2007 for constructing 16 ‘A' type apartments, 48 ‘B' type, 112 ‘C' type and 96 ‘D' type apartments along with a play area and other amenities. Nevertheless, there was a slump in the progress of the project for a year.In June 2008, a Lok Adalat comprising the Law Minister Durai Murugan, the then Chief Justice of the High Court A.K. Ganguly and the then Chairman of the Law Commission AR. Lakshmanan directed the Government to complete the project, preferably, by the end of year.A few months thereafter, it was announced that the construction would be taken up by the Public Works Department (PWD) instead of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). A foundation stone laying ceremony was held at Court Hall No.1 of the High Court Bench on November 1, 2008.The PWD, in February 2009, submitted a revised estimate to the Government to hike the project cost from Rs.19.38 crore to Rs.25.2 crore in view of escalation in prices of construction materials and considering the changes made by the High Court to the original building plan.The court had insisted on leaving vehicle parking space in the ground floor. Therefore, it was decided to construct four-storey buildings instead of three-storeys as it was planned originally. The sanction for the revised estimate got delayed due to the Parliamentary elections.After three months, a Government Order was issued in June 2009 granting sanction for Rs.25.2 crore.Subsequently, the PWD kickstarted the process of calling for tenders for various works and finalised the contractors even as the High Court staff waited with bated breath.At last, the court employees were able to see some light at the end of the tunnel on Monday when the officials brought a set of bricks and a bag of sand to the construction site, for the first time, to conduct a ‘bhoomi puja' .Having waited for nearly six years, the staff now only hope and pray that the buildings would come up within 15 to 18 months without any further delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/High-Court-staff-see-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/article16298653.ece
147,Vaiko voices concern over dam issue,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,02:20:16 IST,"Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko on Wednesday criticised the Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi, for not allowing Parvathiammal, mother of Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam leader, V. Prabhakaran, to enter Tamil Nadu to get medical treatment.He was addressing a public meeting here to highlight the proposed agitation blocking all roads leading to Kerala on May 28.Reacting to Mr. Karunanidhi's contention that he was not aware of Ms. Parvathiammal landing at Chennai airport, Mr. Vaiko questioned how a huge posse of police personnel was deployed at the airport before the flight could land. “Did the police come there without the Chief Minister's knowledge? Why did the police block me and P. Nedumaran (convenor of Mullaperiyar Dam Rights Retrieval Committee) from entering the airport though we had visitors' pass with us,” he said.He also condemned Mr. Karunanidhi for his argument that Ms. Parvathiammal was denied entry into Tamil Nadu as she was blacklisted by the Centre based on a recommendation made by the former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa. “If Ms. Parvathiammal was blacklisted, the Indian embassy in Malaysia could not have issued her a visa enabling her to visit India,” Mr. Vaiko said.Mr. Karunadhi always had the liberty to reverse the previous Government's decision on allowing Ms. Parvathiammal, considering her condition, he said. He sought an apology from the Centre and the State for their “inhuman” act against an ailing aged woman.On the dam issue, Mr. Vaiko said he had little hope that the Supreme Court could render justice to Tamil Nadu. He said that people of Tamil Nadu could not nurture any faith on the apex court that had reversed its own three-member bench verdict on the dam row by constituting a five-member committee to study the stability of the structure. He wondered what the panel was going to do after two Central committees had certified the stability of the dam and after which the Supreme Court allowed the level to be raised to 142 feet.He wanted the people of Tamil Nadu to participate in large numbers in the May 28 road roko in the interest of the future generations of the five districts benefited by Periyar dam. “If we failed to check Kerala Government in its plan to decommission the dam, these districts would become a desert,” he said.Mr. Nedumaran said that the Chief Minister could have put pressure on the Centre to implement the Supreme Court verdict on the dam issue citing the unrest caused in the State by the Opposition parties.Communist Party of India's State deputy secretary, C. Mahendran, warned that nationalism should ensure that every citizen was equally treated.

148,Pudhurai Vannars seek community certificates,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,02:16:12 IST,"For a few members belonging to the Pudhirai Vannar caste, obtaining community certificates has become more than an uphill task. The members have been running from pillar to post for months together representing their case in the grievance meetings but all in vain.S.Pechiammal and M.Alagarsamy of Pudhupatti, A .Muruganandam, Ettimangalam near Melur, K.Murugan, Keeraithurai and V.Murugan, Vavval Thottam have submitted petitions to the Adi Dravidar Tribal Welfare Minister, District Collector and Revenue Divisional Officer.V.Murugan, member, Tamil Nadu Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board, says “for the above said members of Pudhirai Vannar caste it is stated so in their school certificates but community certificates are not issued to them.” When enquired in the office of Adi Dravidar Welfare Department, all that Murugan and his fellow caste members were told was that it was stopped 15 years ago.The community members alleged that certificates were given randomly; in most cases, anyone among the family holds a certificate but when asked for others in the family the authorities are reluctant to issue them.According to government records, the Pudhirai Vannars are one among the 76 Scheduled Castes. The name, Pudhirai Vannar, is listed 60th in the Tamil Nadu list of Scheduled Castes, as laid out by the Scheduled Castes (Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into effect from July 27, 1977.However, the state authorities do not easily issue community certificates in the name of Puthirai Vannars. Mr.Murugan has in fact raised this issue during the first meeting held at Chennai on January 28, after the establishment of a separate “Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board” G.O. No.114.The members said that it was great that the State had established a board and provided Rs.50 lakh for the year 2009–2010 to extend relief to the needy registered members of the board.All this is welcome but we need community certificates to get a sense of belongingness to our own caste identity, they alleged. Pudhirai Vannars remain as a caste that can be referred to as victims of ‘multiple marginalisation' who provide services to Dalits.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Pudhurai-Vannars-seek-community-certificates/article16298650.ece

  | Photo Credit: Bijoy Ghosh The Murugappa Group has set itself a turnover of target of over $7 billion to be hit by 2013-14. At present, the group has a turnover of $3.03 billion.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, A. Vellayan, Executive Chairman of the group, said each business unit of the group had worked out a strategy to grow at 24 per cent annually. With the country's GDP (gross domestic product) projected to grow at 8 per cent, Mr. Vellayan felt that the sales target was achievable. He said all the business units were looking to grow three times the GDP.The group's turnover for 2009-10 dropped by 14 per cent from Rs. 15,907 crore to Rs. 13,617 crore, mainly due to a sharp drop in the prices of key inputs for Coromandel International Ltd., the Executive Chairman said. Coromandel reported a 32 per cent decline in its turnover at Rs. 6,431 crore, the biggest sales drop among the group companies.Notwithstanding the setback on the turnover front, the Murugappa Group reported a 22 per cent jump in EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation) at Rs. 1,879 crore against Rs. 1,535 crore. The profit before tax (excluding extraordinary income) of the group grew by 29 per cent to Rs. 1,354 crore from Rs. 1,054 crore.Mr. Vellayan said that the group was able to ride the wave of economic rebound powered by enterprise-wide efficiency. EID Parry, he said, had increased its daily cane crushing capacity to 32,500 tonnes (along with 150 MW co-generation power and 230 kl alcohol) by acquiring Sadashiva Sugars in Karnataka and GMR Industries, which have plants in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The sugar refinery at Kakinada was expected to start operations this month, he added.Besides sugar, Mr. Vellayan indicated that fertilizers and engineering could be key growth areas for the group in the coming years. “With favourable growth outlook for auto and commercial vehicles sector, we see a growth potential of 20 per cent,” said N. Srinivasan, Director (Finance), Murugappa Group.Mr. Vellayan admitted that the group's foray into China was not a good experience. While the group closed its tube operations, it pulled out of the abrasive joint venture in China.On the challenges being faced on the HR front in the wake of entry of MNCs and big industrial houses from across the country into Tamil Nadu, he said “We have seven home grown CEOs heading the group companies. The management development centre conducts leadership and business development programmes.”",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/Murugappa-Group-profit-up-29-per-cent-at-Rs.-1350-crore/article16298863.ece

Customer research has already shown that BMW is the strongest premium car brand and we hope to keep this customer confidence intact and grow even faster,” Dr. Schaaf added.Dr. Schaaf, who has completed his doctoral thesis and studied business administration at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, has come to head BMW's India operations after a successful stint as the Vice-President of BMW Group Korea with responsibility of sales and marketing. Before joining BMW Group Korea, he was the head of market development for the region Asia, Pacific, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe.On the other hand, Mr. Kronschnabl will be leading the German carmaker's Russia operations, where the company enjoys the leadership position. Since BMW India's inception in 2006, Mr. Kronschnabl not only built the BMW brand, setting up sales and service networks, but also took the Munich-headquartered company to the numero uno position. “I wish and hope that BMW India grows even faster… BMW is not just a brand, it's a philosophy,” he said in his farewell message.In 2009, BMW overtook Mercedes as the top luxury carmaker in the Indian market with sales of 3,619 units. Its market share in the luxury segment has crossed 40 per cent against just 9 per cent in 2006. With its recent launch of new 5 Series sedan in India, the luxury carmaker is upbeat on its sales.In 2010, the company has set even more ambitious target of achieving the sales of 4,000-units, besides expanding its network, taking the brand to Tier-II and Tier-III cities.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/BMW-India-hopes-to-retain-top-position/article16298864.ece

155,OVL consortium to sign contract for Venezuela oilfield next week,PTI,2010-05-06,16:31:12 IST,"ONGC Videsh Ltd and its partners will next week sign contracts for developing a giant oilfield in Venezuela that will give energy deficient India 3.6 million tonnes a year of crude oil.“The contract for the Carabobo-1 project will be signed on May 12,” a company official said.Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and India Oil Minister Murli Deora are likely to witness the signing at Caracus.ONGC Videsh Ltd — the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) — and its partners, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Oil India Ltd, will invest $2.181 billion in the 400,000 barrels per day (20 million tonnes a year) project over the next five years.The official said Indian firms hold an 18 per cent stake in the Carabobo-1 project, which will be operated by Spain’s Repsol-YPF and Petronas of Malaysia.The Carabobo-1 project of the Orinoco extra-heavy oil belt of Venezuela will involve a total investment of close to $21 billion over 25 years. The three firms will invest $2.181 billion during the 2010 to 2015 period and may be able to fund most of the future investment from the revenues they will start earning when the project goes onstream in three years.In February, the Indian trio won rights to develop the Carabobo-1 project along with Repsol-YPF and Petronas after committing themselves to pay a signing amount of $1.05 billion and making an equivalent amount available to Venezuela’s state-run PdV as a loan.Repsol-YPF, OVL and Petronas will each hold a 11 per cent stake in the ‘mixed company’ that will develop Carabobo-1, while seven per cent will be split between IOC and OIL. The remaining 60 per cent participating interest will be with PdV.The project will give India 3.6 million tonnes of crude oil annually out of the envisaged output of 400,000 barrels a day.Of the initial investment, OVL will invest $1.333 billion, while IOC and OIL will invest $454 million each.The Carabobo-1 project, comprising the Carabobo-1 Central and Carabobo-1 North blocks, will develop extra-heavy crude production capacity of up to 400,000 barrels per day (20 million tonnes a year). Early output of at least 50,000 bpd is slated to start in 2012-13, before rising to its peak in 2016.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/OVL-consortium-to-sign-contract-for-Venezuela-oilfield-next-week/article16298750.ece

Consumer prices in India, particularly of food, have “remained stubbornly high”, it said while pointing to the Consumer Price Index (for industrial workers) which rose to nearly 9 per cent in 2008 and further to 12 per cent in 2009. “A faster increase in food prices has become a cause of concern,” it said.Turning to the South Asian economies, ESCAP expressed concern over the high deficits in some countries owing to the expansionary policies to counter the impact of the global financial crisis. “It is important that governments in the sub-region prepare a clear road map for fiscal consolidation to be implemented at the earliest to contain growing public debt…Yet another challenge is to manage portfolio capital inflows, mainly by FIIs that are leading to build-up of bubbles in capital markets and putting upward pressure on the exchange rates,” the report said.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ESCAP-projects-8.3-GDPgrowth-for-India-this-fiscal/article16298857.ece

167,Mauritius elections hold promise for India,Pranay Gupte,2010-05-06,23:23:21 IST,"Mauritius Prime Minister Navin Ramgoomam cast his vote at a polling booth in Vacoas town, Mauritius. File Photo: AP
  Now that the three-party alliance of Navin Ramgoolam has won 41 of the 60 seats in the Mauritius national Parliament — more than double the number of Paul Berenger's leftist Mouvement Militant Mauricien — there is general agreement that the 63-year-old former physician and lawyer has obtained a powerful mandate to implement economic and social reforms in his second consecutive term as this island-nation's Prime Minister.Some of those reforms eluded him during his first term; indeed, a few unpopular measures that Mr. Ramgoolam introduced — such as a national residential property tax, and another tax on interest from savings — spurred flight of capital in certain circles. The expectation is that such measures will be reviewed and possibly eliminated.The Prime Minister has also pledged a more aggressive “democratisation” of the economy — ensuring, among other things, that ownership of the vast sugarcane plantations that are currently controlled by the minority whites of French descent is also made accessible to other communities in this country of 1.3 million people dominated by Hindus. Creoles, Christians and Muslims also compromise larger sections of the demographic cohort than the Francos. A special “democratisation unit” has been formed in the Prime Minister's office, and its workload is certain to be amplified.Mr. Ramgoolam's election victory has also brought relief to several business supporters who had been targeted by Mr. Berenger and his financial backers. They had been apprehensive that the Berenger group would subvert, if not entirely destroy, their commerce.
Opposition claim
The 65-year-old Mr. Berenger, silver-haired and wearing an open-necked blue shirt, appeared at a gathering of followers early on Thursday evening and promised to continue “fighting the good fight”, and promised to work toward national unity. He was gracious about the Prime Minister's victory — a sentiment not necessarily appreciated by many in his audience — but asserted that the elections were neither free nor fair. Mr. Berenger chided the national television network for blatantly favouring the Prime Minister's alliance in order to ensure its victory.The Ramgoolam alliance's victory, however, will most definitely be welcomed by India, not the least because Mauritius contributes $12 billion in foreign direct investment to India, by far the biggest annual FDI from any country. Mr. Berenger — a former Prime Minister himself — while publicly proclaiming his fidelity to an “umbilical relationship” with India, has been known to privately express a desire for strengthened commercial and political relations with France and other Western powers.India's Chief Election Commissioner Navin Chawla has been here for the last several days at the invitation of the government. He was not an official observer, of course, but other Indian representatives in Mauritius must feel emboldened now to suggest stronger technical, educational and computer-science links between both countries. They are surely mindful of the disappointment of influential Mauritian business leaders that such ties were not deepened by India in the last few years.But they are also mindful that Mr. Ramgoolam enjoys a warm personal rapport with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. On Thursday, therefore, there were renewed expectations that Mr. Ramgoolam's new term could usher in an era characterised by enhanced bilateral economic and political relations.Those expectations took into account a public position by Mr. Ramgoolam that the Indian Ocean coral atoll of Diego Garcia — part of the Chagos Archipelago — would be turned over to Mauritius by the United States, which has maintained a large military base there since a 1971 secret agreement with the British Labour government of then Prime Minister Harold Wilson. That agreement called for Diego Garcia to be leased to the U.S.; the military base has been used by Washington for missile launches and naval operations against suspected terrorist havens in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and also parts of Africa.Some Indian critics have long felt that the American presence on Diego Garcia represented a form of political hegemony in the Indian Ocean, territory that ordinarily should be viewed as within India's sphere of influence.Mr. Ramgoolam has also suggested that Mauritius co-administer Tromelin Island, currently a French territory.
Concern for India
But one major issue of concern to India that may crop up during his new administration is that of China's growing economic presence in Mauritius, and its ambition to widen political influence throughout Africa. For example, China is building a new palm-frond-shaped airport here; it is also creating an industrial city from where goods will be re-exported to Africa and Europe.It is not that Mr. Ramgoolam is particularly wooing China, although its contribution to the local economy has been welcomed. It is India that has lagged in taking timely advantage of the economic opportunities available in a country of high literacy and aspirations to become a high-tech centre for the region.Such geopolitical considerations, of course, were not quite the stuff of the main conversations on Thursday in Mauritius as the election results poured in, and the winners celebrated at rallies while losers lamented without seeming to be grieving. Politics, after all, is not only about democracy, it is also about deportment.There was wide delight that Mr. Ramgoolam's second term would represent stability and continuity — his trusted lieutenant, Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun won from his constituency in the capital of Port Louis, in what had been a race made difficult and ugly by his opponent.It was also noted that, in addition to Paul Berenger's general political loss, the opposition front bench had been considerably weakened by the defeat of three of his closest aides. The craggy old leftist has now only his own shoulders to lean on, at least in Parliament. But who said politics was fair?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Mauritius-elections-hold-promise-for-India/article16298868.ece

  Auctioneers Christie's is facing a bitter compensation claim after a drawing it sold for £11,400 as a 19th-century German picture is claimed, actually, to be a 15th-century Leonardo da Vinci worth £100 million.The picture's original owner, Jeanne Marchig, who runs a U.K. foundation for animal welfare, is accusing the auction-house of negligence, alleging that it misattributed the drawing. She claims that, in failing to “exercise due care”, it sold the artwork for a “fraction” of its true value, according to a complaint filed in the Manhattan federal court.The drawing, a profile of a girl, is now on exhibition in Gothenberg, Sweden, as a Da Vinci. Ms Marchig is seeking unspecified damages, but court papers seen by the Guardian show her lawyer wants a substantial figure. They say the drawing is insured for more than $100 million and that its value exceeds $150 million.Ms Marchig was “devastated” when she discovered last July — in a call from Christie's — that the Da Vinci scholar Martin Kemp had hailed the portrait as La Bella Principessa, a depiction of Bianca Sforza, daughter of the Duke of Milan. The court papers assert that there is ample evidence that it is a Da Vinci. They mention a faint fingerprint, which matches that on a painting by Da Vinci, and carbon tests indicating dates from 1440 to 1650, not the 19th century. Christie's is accused of failure to use scientific methods and technology.But other experts are unconvinced of the attribution. Jacques Franck, the Da Vinci consultant at UCLA, told the Guardian on Wednesday: “It's not Leonardo's hand. The drawing presents anatomical mistakes, notably the link between the neck and the bust.” A Christie's spokesman said: “Christie's strongly disagrees with these claims and believes they are without merit.” — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Legal-battle-over-ldquoda-Vincirdquo/article16298867.ece
169,Kabul unveils plan to disarm militants,Jon Boone,2010-05-06,23:22:49 IST,"Afganistan President Hamid Karzai
  Top Taliban leaders could be offered exile outside Afghanistan if they agree to stop fighting the government of Hamid Karzai, a long-expected peace plan by the Afghan government will propose later this month.The far-reaching proposals, seen by the Guardian, also call for “deradicalisation” classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs created for foot soldiers who renounce violence.The long-delayed Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme has emerged just as Mr. Karzai prepares to go to Washington for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama, where the issue is likely to be top of the agenda.The plan will then be presented later in the month to a gathering of representatives from across Afghanistan called the National Consultative Peace Jirga. Once agreed upon, the government will be able to start spending around $160 million pledged by the international community to lure fighters away from the conflict. The document refers to such fighters as “angry brothers”, reflecting the belief that a substantial portion of insurgents are not motivated by strong ideological beliefs.Little is said in the report about the Taliban leaders managing the war against Mr. Karzai's government. However, it does say insurgent leaders could face “potential exile in a third country”.Saudi Arabia has been used in the past for such purposes, and there has been widespread speculation that exile could be offered to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hizb-e-Islami armed group, which in March sent a peace delegation to Kabul for talks with Mr. Karzai.Western powers are likely to be pleased by the level of detail about the new High Level Peace Council, which will take over from a notoriously chaotic predecessor body accused of reintegrating fighters who subsequently took up arms again.However, diplomats are worried that the government lacks the capacity to implement a programme that calls for complex activities in around 4,000 villages most affected by the insurgency. One diplomat said: “For the international community money is not a problem, they will pay whatever it takes. One gets a sense that there are people on the military side who will do most of the work and then give it some sort of an Afghan face.” The High Council and its executive body will be in charge of processing fighters who want to live peacefully. They will initially be put in “demobilisation centres” for a “cooling off” period of 90 days where their needs can be assessed and their personal security assured.If they agree to lay down their arms and cut ties with al Qaeda they will be entitled to an amnesty against prosecution for any crimes they may have committed. They will also be issued with a biometric “reintegration card”. They will then be offered a “menu” of options designed to keep them peacefully occupied, including vocational training in such trades as carpet-weaving and tailoring.There will also be the option to go through “deradicalisation” training, of the sort pioneered by Saudi Arabia. However, the report acknowledges the complexity of such programmes, the lack of “adequate experience” in Afghanistan and the likely need to send “highly radicalised” people to other countries for treatment.Major new institutions will also be set up to manage enormous job-creation schemes. An Engineering and Construction Corps will focus on labour-intensive work, such as the construction of Afghanistan's national highway system and other large-scale infrastructure projects. It also envisages teams of ex-Taliban fighters being rapidly deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and landslides. By far the most controversial option is the option for former insurgents to join the Afghan Army or police force. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Kabul-unveils-plan-to-disarm-militants/article16298866.ece

  T
ime magazine has just named President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the world's most influential leader. Barack Obama is ranked fourth. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is 19th (there are only four heads of state or government in the list). This is an exercise somewhat different from the traditional “Person of the Year” selection Time engages in each December, but highly revealing nonetheless. It is defined as “not about the influence of power, but about the power of influence.” Time has never selected a Latin American leader as person of the year. In India, Mahatma Gandhi made it in 1930.Brazil, once known as “the country of the future” that would always remain as such, has come a long way. That this should happen at the close of the eight-year presidency of the leader of the Brazilian Workers party (the PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores), whose very election prospects in 2002 led to a run on the real, the Brazilian currency, and BOVESPA, the Sao Paulo stock market, is striking.What is the secret of Lula and Brazil's success? How come a country best known until 20 years ago for its runaway inflation and rollercoaster economy has made it its present condition an investors' darling, that applies highly effective social policies, and that has positioned itself as a veto player in international affairs, one without whose acquiescence no major global initiative is viable?With a land mass of some 8.5 million square kilometres, the world's fifth largest, comparable to the continental United States, Brazil is more a continent than country. With a population of 190 million, and growing fast, it is not quite in the same league as China and India (which is why some people said there were “only two BRICs in the wall”), but is still the fifth most populated country. More than one out of three Latin Americans is Brazilian. With a GDP approaching $2 trillion, it is the eighth largest economy.Yet, Brazil's size has been immense ever since its independence in the 19th century, whereas its rise to the frontlines of international affairs has taken place only in the past 20 years. Why?The answer is simple: presidential leadership. Most would be hard-pressed to name a Brazilian president from the 1960s to the 1990s. For 20 years the country was run by obscure generals, and in 1985, with the return of democracy, by lacklustre civilians, who did little to combat the runaway inflation and the deep imbalances in one of the most unequal societies in the world.Lula has done a remarkable job, but he stands on the shoulders of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994-2002). It was as the improbable Minister for Finance of President Itamar Franco in 1993 that Cardoso, a sociologist, made his mark. He was the author of the Plan Real that brought inflation under control, and launched him all the way to Planalto, the presidential palace in Brasilia. Much like 1991 was a turnaround year in India, when under Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the country started to liberalise and open up its economy, 1993 was such a year in Brazil, and it has never looked back.Cardoso realised that Brazil needed not just to stabilise its currency but also to open up and deregulate its economy, stifled by decades of rampant protectionism. He privatised state enterprises, opened the doors for FDI and pushed business into export markets. Whereas in 1990 foreign trade reached 11 per cent of the GDP, it is now at 24 per cent. Whereas until 1990 Brazil attracted less than $1 billion a year in FDI, today it is, after China, the country in the developing world that attracts the most, reaching as much as $40 billion a year in recent times.By stabilising the polity and the economy (Brazil had four presidents from 1985 to 1994), Cardoso in his eight years did much to clear the underbrush for Lula. And despite all the criticism Lula had voiced from the opposition against Cardoso's alleged “neoliberal” policies, once he took office in January 2003, he realised that only orthodox economic policies would keep the ghost of inflation away. Lula appointed a conservative banker, Henrique Meirelles, head of the Central Bank, and briefed him to keep his eye on the inflation ball. As The Economist has pointed out, for a country whose average yearly inflation in the early 1990s reached 700 per cent, to have in 2006 a growth rate that was, for the first time, higher than the inflation rate was quite a feat.Lula, a former metal worker who lost one of his fingers on the factory floor, also came up with an imaginative social policy, the Bolsa de Familia. It transfers cash income to some 11 million families, who have to meet certain conditions (including school attendance of children, and monthly visits to government agencies), and has diminished Brazil's income inequality.As a man who cut his political teeth in the trade union movement, Lula knows all about “win-win” negotiations. He has also a remarkable ability to get along with everybody — from George W. Bush to Hugo Chávez. The PT is only one among many in the fragmented Brazilian party system (it controls only the governorships in three States out of Brazil's 27), and he leads a coalition government that includes right-wing parties, in Brazil's hard to manage “presidential coalitionism.” He has struck a delicate balance in which the private sector is the driving force of the economy, but the state plays a significant role through entities such as the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento (BNDES), which has a larger lending budget than the World Bank, and Petrobras, the state-owned oil company.In a country known for its populist, demagogic traditions, Lula embodies the modern leader who believes in institutions. In a region where many presidents want to perpetuate themselves in office, he rejected the possibility of changing the Constitution to allow him a third term. His own rags-to-riches trajectory and austere personal habits have meant that the corruption scandals that affected some of his staff never seriously dented his popularity, leading to the moniker of “teflon president”. His approval ratings have reached 80 per cent. He has been mentioned for a variety of top international jobs once he leaves office on 1 January 2011— from President of the World Bank to Secretary-General of the United Nations.Given that in foreign affairs also Lula has made a big impact, this is not surprising. With Celso Amorim as his Foreign Minister, he has capitalised on Brazil's “diplomatic GDP.”With an outstanding Foreign Ministry — known as “Itamaraty” for the 19th century palace in Rio de Janeiro that used to house it before the capital moved to Brazilia — Brazil has exercised its diplomacy with finesse and effectiveness. On the multilateral front, its ability to build coalitions, to give direction to the international agenda, and to take on key global governance issues has stood out. It has displayed it in the WTO and the U.N., as well as in the creation of (or inclusion in) myriad acronyms such as BRICs, BRICSAM, IBSA, the G20+, the G4, the O5, and, most notably, in the G20 at the leaders level (“the steering committee of the world economy”) launched in Washington in November 2008, and whose next meeting is being held in Toronto in late June. It has also put its money where its mouth is: at a time when many Foreign Ministries have cut budgets and closed embassies, Brazil, grasping that diplomacy has become more, and not less, significant in the age of globalisation, has done the opposite. From 2003 to 2008 it opened 32 embassies abroad, and now has 134.In Latin America also Brazil has played a key role. It has been the driving force behind new entities such as UNASUR, which has brought together all nations in South America, and the associated South American Defence Council, designed to provide an alternative to the by-now obsolete Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. It has taken the lead in stabilising Haiti through MINUSTAH, the first U.N. peacekeeping mission formed by a majority of Latin American troops and headed by a Brazilian general. It is willing to work with Washington, but not if that entails sacrificing principles such as democratic rule, as shown in last year's Honduran crisis.Instead of caving in to the so-called imperatives of globalisation, as so many other developing nations have done, Lula has led Brazil to assert its autonomy and independence, setting its own conditions for dealing with an international order in flux. His is the best example of the power of agency and initiative in foreign policy and diplomacy.

Uma Maheswari said on Wednesday.Kicking off the Intensive Student Enrollment Awareness Campaign in Karur district at the Panchayat Union Primary School at Taragampatty near here Dr. Uma Maheswari said that an enumeration undertaken by the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan last year revealed that there were 73,154 children in the age group of six and 10 in the district.Of them 37,809 were boys and the rest girls. Of them, a total of 72,469 have been undergoing studies in various schools in the district and efforts were being made to enroll the balance 685 students who have stopped going to school or have not been admitted to schools.During the last year's census on children in the 11 to 14 years age group, a total of 55,702 students including 27,216 girls were enlisted. Of them 54,671 children have joined schools in the district while the SSA authorities were taking efforts to track down the rest 1,031 boys and girls and get them enrolled in schools, Dr. Uma Maheswari said. The stress would be on finding the reasons for the dropouts in particular cases and also ensuring that the children never enrolled were admitted in the nearby schools to pursue their education. While the officials were doing their bit, the role of the parents and the elders in the family need to be stressed, the Collector said.

The achievement of Anbakam Metals was illustrated in Home News Tribune and Sentinel.The award stresses the importance of exports in the national economy and illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities, the Sentinel reported. “Anbakam's niche markets have been focussed on the Indian subcontinent region and the Far East. The firm has helped to create a demand for containerized shipments of metal scrap while supplying jobs amid a gloomy job market.It has used the Department of Commerce's Gold Key Program to create business opportunities and sales in the Vietnam market,” the report said.While working as a business software developer for JP Morgan Chase Mr. Sivakumar started the company by customising containers for easy loading of scrap metal for export from trucks to ships at the Northeast region of United States.The company moved 10,000 tonnes of scrap metal to overseas market last year using the small volumes approach that had been vogue for years in California and Florida.Exports by the company accounted for one per cent of the 14 million tonnes of ferrous exports from the US in 2009, according to the report published by Home News Tribune. A press release issued by the company's Liaison Office, Tiruchi, said that the award designed by the US Government to recognise export businesses illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities and companies which have successfully entered into international markets and had great success with the help of US Government agencies.Anbakam Metals is now looking to extend its services to newer, untouched markets, the release said.Mr. Sivakumar, who started his career as a 22-year-old with Pershing Corp, which specialised in business intelligence technology, and subsequently worked for BMW and JP Morgan, before venturing into the metal scrap business, said of Anbakam's future plans: “In next three to six months, we will be breaking ground for a power plant in South India and also venturing into renewable energy sector in the USA. By providing countries with these raw materials and our services, we become an essential part to the infrastructural growth in these markets.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/USA-honours-Tiruvarur-emigrant-with-award/article16298621.ece

We have absolute confidence in these players,” Loew said.There was, as expected, no place for midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger who has moved to Italian side Lazio after losing his place in the VfB Stuttgart side.Eight players were part of the 2006 World Cup team that had clinched third place: Ballack, Lahm, Klose, Schweinsteiger, Per Mertesacker, Arne Friedrich (Hertha Berlin), Marcell Jansen (Hamburger) and Lukas Podolski (Cologne).Loew said the preparations for the World Cup had never been more difficult or complicated because of the many leading players who will be joining training camps later in view of their club commitments.Ballack, who is appearing with Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and the Bayern and Bremen players, who are in the German Cup final a week on Saturday, will miss a friendly against Malta a day earlier.The Bayern players won’t be able to join up with the rest of the squad until after the May 22 Champions League final against Inter Milan in Madrid.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Seven-Bayern-players-in-Germany-WC-squad/article16298812.ece

We went for it.“People will think I’m mad coming away from home like this — all the top teams only play with one up front now. I’m very pleased — it’s great for the club, a good achievement, and we have played great football this year.” Spurs were bottom of the table when Redknapp took over in October 2008 but quickly turned them around.“Of course this means a lot to me,” he said. “I’m delighted, but I know I’m good at my job. I wouldn’t have done it if I was a mug.” Tottenham were the better side throughout, and Ledley King had the ball in the net in the first half, but his goal was ruled out for a foul.Adam Johnson tested Huerelho Gomes in the Tottenham goal, and the goalkeeper stopped a deflection from his own defender, Gareth Bale, before Kolo Toure headed straight at Gomes.Jermain Defoe forced a good save from Martin Fulop, and for a long time it looked as if it would be a draw.But with eight minutes to go, Younes Kaboul sent in a cross that took a deflection, and Fulop palmed the ball straight at Crouch, who headed the ball over the line.“I’m just very happy to finish fourth. That’s where we wanted to be,” Redknapp said. “It was important someone got in from outside the big four, I could only see Man City breaking in.“I thought it was going to be really tough — I could only see us finishing in the top seven and getting a European place.

He received the ball on the left, powered past four defenders and made it 3-1 with a precise, low drive.Gonzalo Higuain made it 4-1 with an audacious lob as Mallorca lost heart and spirit.Higuain has scored 26 league goals, one more than Ronaldo, but five less than Barca’s Lionel Messi.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Ronaldo-hat-trick-gives-Real-Madrid-vital-win/article16298729.ece

  A young veena performer from the Lalgudi family, immersed in a concert by veena S. Balachander and her aunt-guru Padmavathi Ananthagopalan, was called on stage by the maestro himself to take part. She impressed enough for him to announce that the young talent would henceforth flourish in his school. If that was a day Jayanthi Kumaresh cherishes, it is no wonder that her performances today, resonant with Balachander's style, are stamped with remarkable intellectual value.Even the recent Kumaresh-Jayanthi ‘violin-veena melodic-samvaada' at the Chamarajpet Ramseva Mandali was steeped in classicism with nary a hint of dumbing down.Although Lalgudi Rajalakshmi's gifted daughter continued her tutelage under Balachander till his death in 1990, she makes it a point to underscore the strong foundation and strict schooling she received from her aunt Padmavathi.“It wasn't just the classes, the disciplinarian that she was had me work in clockwork precision through the day. After school, her timetable had me take up yoga, typing, French classes, dance, music lessons and creative pursuits of writing and poetry.”Jayanthi, who has a Masters in English Literature, says “every pursuit will come in handy for decades”.Consider the sumptuousness of her approach, which, from the gayaki styling went on to grasp the highly individualistic creativity of Balachander's genius.“Every raga has to be discovered beyond its clichéd phrases,” she says. “Balachander was fond of raga expositions more than format-kritis, as lyrics and language, he believed, were beyond the realms of an instrument.”Jayanthi too is self-made, as her approach over the years of melodic discovery is fashioned in a way that “people understand the divine characteristics of the instrument too”. Novelty in her exercises are also to be commended, for, nothing strays beyond the classical contours. It is here that her husband Kumaresh explains her CD Thillana-Thillana that has some bracing exclusivity.Jayanthi enjoys her role in Shastriya Syndicate Presentations (a Hindustani and Carnatic collaboration) just as she sounds animated to spearhead her fusion band, Indian Spice, that has piquant raga-based presentations with vocals, drums, Latin percussion, keyboard, tabla, violin and, of course, the veena.",https://www.thehindu.com/arts/Shes-got-the-whole-world-on-a-string/article16299553.ece
181,Life on the edge,jigar shah,2010-05-06,14:39:35 IST,"Abhishek Bachchan in 'Raavan'.
  
Abhishek Bachchan must be a happy man — not everyone gets to work for Mani Ratnam thrice! His third film with the celebrated director, Raavan is slated to hit the marquees soon. The actor narrates the unforgettable experience the film was, and why his role is the most fun he's played yet. Excerpts.


We see you jumping off a cliff, in the Raavan promo. Did it yourself?

Yeah. It was in Hogenakkal, and it was 90-foot high. Mani said: ‘I can't let my lead actor jump; the river current is strong, and there's rock below the water'. The insurance guys agreed (laughs). But, I insisted I'd do it myself, for we had a diver along, to teach me. A five-year-old boy jumped next to us, those were kids who do it for money. So, I told Mani: ‘If he can do it, so can I.'

What was going on in your mind when you jumped?

The jump takes so long that you actually have the time to think ‘Oh God, I am going to die'… but, it was fun. I did it just once. In fact, I've not done a more physically and emotionally challenging film in my career. Shooting drains you, but you feel nice when you return home; you feel you've achieved something.

Could you connect to the mythological Raavan while playing this character?

Look, the film is not like any other film. However, it has glimpses of mythology, just like any other film. When I told Mani people will draw comparisons, he asked me to name one film that wasn't influenced by mythology. And, I couldn't! But, Raavan is a modern film. It is not inspired by any other character or contemporary leader. He is just a character Mani came up with.

But your character Beera is spoken of as having 10 heads… just like Raavan.

The ten heads refer to ten personalities — there are ten different facets that are easily referred to as dus sar. Incidentally, Beera's pet name in the film is Raavan. Beera is like an animal — he is wild and unpredictable. He's the most fun guy I've ever played. We actors make character sketches so we can follow them in deciding what a character would and wouldn't do. For example, there are certain things Gurukant Desai (Guru) could do and couldn't. But, Beera will be laughing one minute, and the next, there'll be anger on his face. The fun thing about Beera is there's nothing he won't do; he can get away with anything.

How was it to work with Mani Ratnam for the third time — after Yuva and Guru?

You are in awe of him because of what he brings to the table, but the moment he says cut, he becomes this close friend. His favourite line is ‘Keep it real, make it real'. While you are standing in five feet of freezing water, with snakes swimming around and leeches sticking to you, Mani says: ‘Do anything, but make it a convincing performance'. If you are standing under the waterfall or on a hostile terrain, you'll find Mani leading from the front, standing in waist-deep water himself. If he can do it, who are you to not?

Were you scared for Aishwarya that she too had to do stunts, as in the song ‘Behne de'?

You know what? Half-way through rough terrains, she was the one guiding me as to where to place my feet. In fact, she's the film's hero; Dev and Beera are the heroines. She was helping Kenny (actor Vikram) sir too. Kenny and I'd watch her stunts wondering: ‘kaise karti hai re? (hey, how does she do it?)'. Not just stunts, she picks up everything in a jiffy — think dance steps. So much so that after our three- or four-day dance rehearsals, our performance is judged against hers!

How is it to act with your wife?

It's great to work with one of the finest actors and one of the most dedicated professionals in the country. But, the best part is, the moment Mani announces ‘pack up', I'm with my wife!

182,A method in madness,SHELLEY WALIA,2010-05-06,19:14:59 IST,"Jonathan Littell's novel The Kindly Ones is a translation of the French version published in 2006. Ever since its publication, it has achieved a monumental status both in France and the rest of the world with its grim World War II plot. It concerns the life of Maximilien Aue who unemotionally participates in the Nazi atrocities, and has been at Auschwitz and at Berlin during the Allied attacks. As Littell aptly puts it, his hero is a ‘roving X-Ray, a scanner', more of a machine than human to whom the landscape is as important as the gas chambers.The novel is largely a reworking of the Orestia myth where after killing his mother Clytemnestra, Orestes is hounded by the Furies. At the end of the Greek play, the Furies are appeased and metamorphose into Eumenides which literally means ‘the oindly ones'. Orestes goes free and unpunished just as Aue, who, on the one hand, is an obedient slave of the genocide machinery, and on the other, becomes a reliable and an objective narrator of the Nazi crime, claiming that genocide paradoxically has behind it the impetus of “calm, collected'' ordinary people. Though addressed to his ‘human brothers' the book seeks answers to the reason why such heartless cruelty exists in the world. As Aue maintains: ‘Now of course the war is over. And we've learned our lesson, it won't happen again. But are you quite sure we've learned our lesson? Are you certain it won't happen again?' He goes on to argue: ‘There are psychopaths everywhere, all the time. Our quiet suburbs are crawling with pedophiles and maniacs, our homeless shelters are packed with raving megalomaniacs …and then the very same State that would without batting an eye send them to war crushes them like a blood-swollen mosquito. These sick men are nothing. But the ordinary men that make up the State— especially in unstable times — now there's the real danger. The real danger for mankind is me, is you.'
Contrasts
Guilty of murder and matricide, he remains happily oblivious of his role, busy as he is in the concluding years of his life employed as a Director in a lace factory. Loss of memory of his past is interestingly in contrast with his clear memory of the Nazi madness and the horror of those years of destruction. He is located inside the story of Germany and yet becomes the clear headed analyst from the vantage point of an outsider. Aue's account of Germany war history takes up much of the book. On the other hand the story of his private life as a homosexual incestuously craving for anal sex with his twin sister never reaches any conclusive end.Finally, the book leaves the reader with an open-ended world of questions to a phenomenon that has intrigued the world for decades: why did the very responsible and often learned Nazi supporters back such a terrible programme of extermination. Certainly, not because of the anti-Semitic ideology, nor a personal grouse against the Jews. Justice and responsibility are after all not all that unambiguously simple concepts to deal with. The theme of dichotomy of passion and indifference draws the reader simultaneously to understand the crime and to condemn it.In doing his work, the war criminal does not hate the people he executes, nor is he taking revenge on them or killing them because they are a threat to him. As in the case of Aue, there is no revulsion, shame or guilt. Nevertheless he compares the American soldier in Vietnam with the Nazis: “he is ‘just like you,' and people like you are capable of carrying out even the most horrific acts when the circumstances demand it. If you are an American, consider your little Vietnam adventure, which so traumatized your fellow citizens. You lost fifty thousand troops there in ten years… I obviously am not including the Vietnamese dead; since you never speak of them, in your books or TV programs.… In a total war there can be no civilians, only the fight of one mass against another. In such a fight every participant is equally guilty: the killers with blood on their hands and the supply officers who fuel the trucks. You might have died rather than shoot, but would you have died rather than pump gasoline?”The story derives its significance from the complex notions of justice, guilt and responsibility and takes us back to the controversy over Hannah Arendt's article “Eichmann in Jerusalem” (1963) on Adolf Eichmann's trial. The book becomes intellectually challenging when seen in terms of the sense of duty when the crime begins to take on another shade of the responsibility of action. Within the ambit of one's duty lies the question of behaviour according to the demands of the job in hand even if it means death for some. This is the central paradox of any discussion on the philosophical issue of ethics and duty.
Going beyond
Aue's involvement, like Eichmann's, in sending hundreds of Jews to the gas chambers does not give him any pangs of conscience, but is the result of a deep-seated desire to fulfill the demands of an assignment. Personal feelings or the sense of morality are not permitted to interfere with the sense of duty.To Arendt, it was more a case of thoughtlessness, than a ‘monstrosity', an incapacity to ‘think from the point of view of others.' And Littell elaborates on this idea through a fictional work that is at once history as an eyewitness account as well as a critique of passive acceptance of a role that the state imposes on individuals who headlong turn into cogs in the wheels of the state apparatus.On the human level the choices we make determine our destiny and define our ideological stance. Rules are too conventional and narrow in scope to cover the paradoxes and ironies of our existence.

183,A longing for ease,SOFIA GHORI SALEEM,2010-05-06,19:13:02 IST,"Another Gulmohar Tree written by Aamer Hussein, is a story two people from across the continents who build a life together of quest, commitment and ultimate reward. Lydia is an English woman who meets Usman, a Pakistani writer 10 years her senior, at a socialist seminar in Bloomsbury. She decides to follow Usman back to Pakistan and eventually marries him and settles down in Karachi. The story tells about Lydia's many, seemingly easy adjustments, and adaptations to her new life and culture. Usman, on the other hand, appears to struggle with his life, his career and his family.The book describes the couple to be “Puzzled angels, visiting earth on holiday, lost until you finally find each other.” Lydia certainly comes through as an angel who forsakes her career, her language, culture, religion and country for the sake of her love for a foreign man. She is portrayed as a woman who hits the ground running and changes her name, religion, dress and even learns Urdu, all this before meeting her man again or being certain of a marriage proposal by him.One wonders whether this is the kind of confluence of east and west, people of cross cultural experience desire – a lasting commitment from a western woman whose transformation, acceptance and level of comfort with the eastern culture is so total – its a bit unbelievable. Is this realistic to expect? Can it sustain over long periods of time?Rokeya's (as Lydia now calls herself) experiences with her new culture are not elaborated upon. Her frustrations and learning experiences are foreign to the reader. Rokeya never pines for her native home or her family – except for shedding a tear when her father sends a birthday card late.Her remarkable integration is more seamless that most expatriates returning to their homeland. The book also raises the question: what is the inherent value of someone willing to change so much and demand so little. It's interesting that this book talks about the ease of adjustment when immigrating back to Pakistan just as his previous book Insomnia dwells on some of its difficulties.
Insomnia and Other Stories is a collection of short stories set in no particular place or chronological order. The main protagonist in many of the stories is a Pakistani named Murad. Many of the stories trace the life story of Murad from a young, awkward, impressionable student to a mature writer in his middle age. Hussein writes much about writers themselves in the stories “The Book of Maryam”, the “Angelic Disposition”, “Insomnia” , and “Hibiscus Days”.Hussein returns to certain central themes over and over again in his writings – the flaming Gulmohar tree, the blood red Hibiscus bush.He writes about the right to dream and the choice to serve – about disillusionment and untimely death. He examines friendships and discontinuity and the lonely life of writing. His preoccupation with writing is evident in his recurrent return to this theme.Seclusion seems to be the lot of his writers – sometimes chosen, sometimes accidental, as well as longing and a sense of not belonging. Of living in the fabric of a society and yet pulling back. These are stories about people who share the same intellectual and emotional space and inspire each other to write. Friends that form a network, or a safety blanket if you will, to nurture, coax and egg one on towards goals. All of his writer subjects are middle aged and single or divorced or childless as stated in one of the stories.The “Book of Maryam” quotes from the Quran – the story of the birth of Jesus.In “The Angelic Disposition”, the protagonist takes comfort in the strength of her husband's unquestioning support to grieve for a man who was never more than a friend. She counts on her rosary (tasbeeh) 33 times, then 33 times, then 33 times again, not the names of her Lord, but the words of her friend. The story makes reference to the Christian belief of Satan being a fallen angel – and that angels should never grow old.“Insomnia” is about melancholy, grief and soul searching, death and devastation, where the silence stretches on waiting for the phone to ring for the next encounter with a friend.Aamer Hussein's stories live in the cutting edge of loneliness, pain and a heightened need to communicate every shiny raindrop, every pearly teardrop, every flaming bush and singing thrush.They make you think - about cultural boundaries, about the passage from youth to middle age, about being a foreigner in a different land. About Wars, earthquakes, tsunamis – naturals disasters, death and darkness. About the fallibility of relationships. About feelings and futility.And they remind you of the poem “Spring and Fall – to a Young Child” byGerard Manley Hopkins : Margaret, are you grieving Over Goldengrove unleaving?

184,In the dying light,K. SRILATA,2010-05-06,19:12:02 IST,"“ I have now set out to do the things / you loved most about me./About a gift called poetry… I have set about writing, / what you perhaps would most love me to do - / write about you,” says Gopikrishnan Kottoor. “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” (a sequence of poems that forms part of the larger collection Victoria Terminus) is a tribute to the poet's dying father.That Kottoor should have given himself the permission to write these poems about his father as the latter lay in coma following a brain hemorrhage may be hard for some to understand. But then the poet tells us in no uncertain terms that this is just what his father would have wanted him to do, that, in fact, his father is more than just his muse-of-the-moment. In “saving” the poet's poems on his shelf “as though poems were pigeons/and needed a home,” the older man has nurtured his son's work, offering “a carving of [his] bone/to hone [his] poems upon”.It is at once easy and unimaginably hard to work with subjects so intensely personal, hard to write of events that unfold even as you write. That these poems travel so well is a tribute to Kottoor's abilities as a poet. Images of Christ's crucifixion intertwine with the journey into the ICU of the poet's father: “I remember you laughing your way into the ICU /Like Christ never did upon the cobbled stones.” Oddly touching even if sometimes over the top, the poems in “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” succeed in holding you. There is a sensuous quality to Kottoor's work best exemplified perhaps by the poem “The Man in the Mist”: “Someday these tears will end ./ What began as a wild desire, a wetness under the forest leaves , /turns cold, the sun takes on the words/spoken by the lips of rain, / the fragrances of bright hidden flowers/mating in the open air.” The images are fragile, evocative. One wonders though why Kottoor (with just a few exceptions) avoids the Malayalam kinship terms for father and mother.The second section - “Mother Sonata” – is also meant to be read as a sequence of poems. The poems here are reflections on pain, death and dying and, in this case, it is the poet's mother to whom the poems pay tribute. There are some weak poems in this section. Excessively sentimental and flowery, “Fairy Child” is particularly disappointing: “You were so good to lay my fairy child-head on / When I put my arms around you / you cradled me with misted clouds ,/ as upon lost mountain blues” may pass muster if written by an amateur poet. This inconsistency is somewhat puzzling.“Painted Wagons Rolling”, which forms the third section of the anthology, contains some of Kottoor's best poems. The “millipedes curling up” that emerge in the poem “Digging” testify to the “worship” that “mud-work” is. These mostly invisible creatures of the soil do their “odd jobs” in much the same way, presumably, that a poet does his.For a poet too digs – in his case, for meaning that would otherwise lie buried. The poems in this section boast of a range that is understandably lacking in the earlier two sections, containing reflections on dead poets and what survives their death to sharply satirical portraits triggered by an old boy's reunion.The last section “Victoria Terminus”, planned as another sequence, takes us on board Mumbai's local trains. We look out of the window to see old men defecating, while inside the compartment we meet card players intent on their game despite the fact of there being “not enough floor/to even straighten toes.” We also encounter deaths and bomb blasts - all the stories, big and small, that make up the Mumbai local. While one appreciates the spirit behind these Mumbai local vignettes, one can't help wishing that Kottoor had been more careful in his crafting and diction. Poems like “The Eunuchs” and “Drinking Water” remain on the surface, lacking the subtlety, the layers that emerge in “Digging” and “The Man in the Mist”.

185,‘I’ve always been a writer’,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,19:11:03 IST,"RAHULMEHTA: Coming out.
  | Photo Credit: g mail Rahul Mehta’s short-story collection Quarantine is about young gay men and their relationships with their families and lovers. Written with unusual tenderness and insight, the book represents a coming out of sorts for Mehta, a U.S.-based lecturer whose relatives in India don’t yet know that he is homosexual.
When did you first develop an interest in writing, and specifically creative writing?
I’ve always been a writer. Even when I was 13 or 14, I was telling people that I was going to be a writer. In ninth grade once, we had to do a research project on a career that we were interested in. When we had to submit our proposals for our projects, I chose “writer”, and my teacher wrote back, “That’s not a career. Choose something else.” So I shadowed an advertising executive.To be fair to my teacher, I don’t think she was necessarily trying to discourage me. I think she was just trying to get me to be practical, to save me from a difficult path. Much later, in grad school, one of my professors said a similar thing. She said she always tells her students who want to become writers, “If you can do something else, do it. If you can’t: God help you, and welcome.”
At risk of sounding reductive, was there a connection between your initial realisation that you were gay and your taking up writing? Did writing help you come to terms with your sexuality?
I do think that there is a connection. Being gay forced me early on to question one of the most fundamental aspects of who I am. Naturally, that sense of inquiry extended to other areas as well. I think it led me to ask bigger questions about everything around me. I once had this boss who, ticking items off on her fingers, said, “Gay, Indian, raised in West Virginia…of course you ended up a writer.” I think what she meant was that it was only natural for me to turn to writing as a way to try to make sense of these various experiences and these various selves.
Were these stories written to announce your sexual identity in a public space? Or was the sexual orientation of the characters incidental to the whole?
My intent, always, first and foremost, is to tell a compelling story. Sure, I’m drawn to certain types of narratives and characters, but I never set out writing a story with a specific purpose other than to craft a compelling narrative. In fact, I rarely even know what a story is going to be about when I sit down to write it. The seed for a story is usually a first line that I find interesting in some way; that has some tension, perhaps in the sounds of the words or in the relationship between characters. Then I let whatever tension is inherent in that sentence lead me to what should come next. At least with first drafts, I’m very much a sentence-to-sentence writer.A writer I admire named Gary Lutz once described a similar process. He said when writing a sentence he generally puts down a word and then he tries to figure out what word that first word yearns for. That’s the word he used: “yearns.” I love that.
This is a work about marginalised people in general, not just gay people: your depictions of lonely, elderly people are very empathetic. Are you particularly interested in themes like isolation and personal dislocation?
Yes, absolutely. I do think those are themes and characters I’m particularly drawn to. Perhaps it comes from my growing up feeling so much like an outsider — brown-skinned in a small West Virginian town that was overwhelmingly white — and witnessing so many of my relatives and Indian family friends who seemed, in some way or another, to be outside as well. I grew up with my father’s parents living in our house. I often wondered what it might have felt like to them to land in this tiny southern American town after five decades of living in Mumbai.
There is a bit of sex in the book, but nothing that’s very explicit. Was that a conscious decision?
Several people have made this comment to me, that there isn’t much sex in the book and that what’s there is tasteful. I’m glad to hear it. What it says to me is that the sex doesn’t jump out or distract or hijack the narratives which, as we’ve discussed, aren’t really about sexuality at all. I think my mom would disagree with you, though. Just yesterday she was complaining to me, “Why so much sex?” But maybe, being my mother, she reads it differently than the typical reader. At any rate, I didn’t make a conscious decision one way or another about how much sex to include in the book. But I do think it’s really tough to write about sex.
The tone of the stories “The Cure” and “What We Mean” is more wry and playful than the others, though they are both very poignant in their own ways. Were you trying to be more experimental when you wrote them?
Yes, I do think both those stories have a somewhat different feel – they are much more language-driven than plot-driven. They are of a piece with a slew of shorter works (two to four pages long) that my editor and I eventually decided to cut from the collection because they seemed too different in tone and style than the other stories. Writing these pieces, I was very much influenced by writers like Lutz, whom I mentioned earlier, as well as Lydia Davis, Christine Schutt, Diane Williams and Amy Hempel — writers whose sentences have a sculptural quality and a close attention to sound.
What is your overall impression of attitudes towards homosexuality in India? The Supreme Court judgement legalising homosexuality last year was a welcome step, but it also caused paranoia in conservative circles. Then there was the recent case of a professor who committed suicide after being secretly videotaped having sex with another man.
I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Dr. Siras, and I was shocked by the vicious harassment he endured from the students. Does this event, and the paranoia and uproar you referred to, reflect widespread attitudes toward LGBT people in India? I’m not sure. But what I do know is that I’ve travelled all over India with my partner, Robert, and we’ve rarely felt comfortable being truly open about our relationship. At the same time, Robert and I feel the same discomfort in non-urban areas of the U.S. as well. If we are travelling in America, we will never check into a motel in a small town and ask for a single, king-sized bed. We always take the room with two double beds without making a fuss about it.
Have many of your relatives in India read the book?
I’ve been a total coward when it comes to talking to my relatives in India about the book or about my sexual orientation. I still haven’t told them about either. If they’ve seen the book or seen any of the press, they haven’t mentioned it to me. Honestly, I don’t know how they will react. I guess I’ll find out when I come to India next month. But I have faith in them. I know that they love me, and in the end I do think that that trumps everything. Whatever political and social hang-ups people may have, if they love you, they find a way to understand. I’ve seen this again and again with people in my life. And of course, this extends far beyond sexual orientation. Family members who truly love one another accept each other for who they are, whatever that might be.
Do you read much Indian writing in English? Is there anyone whose work you’re especially impressed by?
Arundhati Roy is basically a minor deity in my eyes. The God of Small Things is one of my all-time favourite novels, and her non-fiction writings and her social and political activism are tremendous inspirations to me. Her work is swelling with generosity and kindness. There are so many works by Indian writers from which I’ve taken inspiration — Vikram Seth’s Golden Gate, Amitav Ghosh’s Shadow Lines, and Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children come to mind. More recently I’ve loved Pankaj Mishra’s The Romantics, Githa Hariharan’s In Times of Siege, and the Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist (which I teach in one of my classes). As for poetry, I love Arun Kolatkar’s Jejuri as well as anything by Agha Shahid Ali.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/lsquoIrsquove-always-been-a-writerrsquo/article16298815.ece
186,Still going strong,BAGESHREE S.,2010-05-06,19:08:20 IST,"The Select Bookshop, Bangalore. Photo: G. RAGHAV
  The bookstore boom in Bangalore has meant the arrival of big corporate chains which offer a lot beside books. But these have in no way dimmed the charm of the much-loved antiquarian book store of Bangalore, The Select Bookshop started way back in 1945. If anything, the old world store off Brigade Road seems more precious than ever before, no less than a landmark of the city.
A wide variety
The store is crammed with unusual and rare second-hand books on a variety of topics ranging from Oriental literature to architecture and gardening. What makes the store extra special is its amiable owner, K.K.S. Murthy, who knows every book, and more often than not, will tell you an interesting story or two on how he came to acquire it.The shop was started by Murthy's bibliophile father K.B.K. Rao, who turned his love for collecting books into a business enterprise. He often travelled from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh to Bangalore to pick out rare books at auctions and eventually started Select here. Mr. Murthy, who was working as an aeronautical engineer in the United States, followed his father's footsteps into the book trade in the 1970s.Even as he worked in New Jersey, Mr. Murthy's weekends were dedicated to scouting for precious books for his father back home. He can vividly recall chancing upon some “extraordinary rejects” in the backyard of Barnes and Noble, such as a rare collection of Carl Jung's writings.Over the years Select has retains its dedicated clientele and new people keep walking in, having heard of this quaint place by word of mouth. The shop has had its share of illustrious customers, including C.V. Raman, Philip Spratt, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar and Ruskin Bond.Select now also has its own imprint, which has brought out some valuable books such as a reprint of Ananda Coomaraswamy's Time and Eternity.

187,Some rare gems,SHALINI SHAH,2010-05-06,19:07:16 IST,"Space for all: At the Oxford Bookstore, Delhi.
  While dedicated antique bookshops are rare, digging around old bookstores, one can come across some gems. Paramount Book Store on Janpath, New Delhi, is one such store. Ask owner Naresh Kambiri about antique books and he produces a fragile International Library of Famous Literature carefully wrapped in a dusty plastic bag. One of 20, the book had been edited by Dr. Richard Garnett of the British Museum and was published in 1900. Rare books by Kashmiri Sufi saint Lalla Rukh are available too. But there isn't much of a demand. “We've only been getting enquiries, that too mostly from foreigners,” says Kambiri.The Oxford Bookstore has a section on antique and rare books. These include first editions, limited editions, rare publications and out-of-print books. It is interesting to see tomes like Voyages and Travels: India, Ceylon, The Red Sea, Abyssinia and Egypt (first printed in 1811), A New Account of the East Indies: 1688 to 1723 (first printed in 1739), India and its Native Princes: Travels in Central India and in the Presidencies of Bombay and Bengal by Louis Rousselet (1875) and A History of the Indian Mutiny by G.W.

188,A bunch of blooms,SHREEKUMAR VARMA,2010-05-06,19:05:40 IST,"It is one thing to gather a bouquet, and quite another to conjure up a bunch of surprisingly different blooms, that satisfies because of its variety and freshness. Penguin's First Proof 5is a gathering of personal voices that explore moods and relationships, challenges and statistics through fiction, nonfiction and a pinch of verse.
Stunning start
It begins with the stunning story of Ruma, prostitute by day, housewife by night, an activist who yet surrenders to the pressures of husband and family. Bishakha Datta's straightforward prose brings alive the paradox in the life of a woman whose sacrifices may never be recognised by society as we have it today. Samanth Subramaniam's “Hunting the Sailfish” culls tense drama through minimalist narrative, reportage that simmers beneath the surface. Hemingway's ghost looms over us because of the subject, philosophy and sparseness of expression.What follows in the nonfiction section is a quick-fire portrait of jungle-king Veerappan, his interactions with people he's kidnapped. And an interesting sketch of Kutch with its paling borders of landscape, language and people, followed by a very objective study by three women of women who want to have “fun”, the problems they face while occupying space without “purpose”. Editor-in-chief of The New Indian ExpressAditya Sinha's brutally frank forays into family history and latent homosexuality can only result in his being forever persona non grata with a clutch of rankled relatives. Vamsee Juluri's study of non-violence and “Munnabhai” examines the proffered meaning of Gandhi's heritage and its scope, concluding that cinema is still its one faithful follower. Satnam's sojourn in the Bastar jungle is next, along with communist guerrillas, an account of the routine life of militants, with mild, off-the-cuff observations: “A fortress-like structure had been erected with tree branches and bamboo, where the guerrillas practise destroying such fortifications”.And so to fiction.The first offering is K.R. Meera's “Ave Maria”, a brutal glimpse into the debris of Kerala's Communist ideology, the fault lines left behind in families. “The Imaginary Friend” tells of a man and his little cousin, a train journey that shows how the mind can make or break. “The Brass Tumbler” follows the tradition of classic Hindi fiction, the story of an heirloom whose history mirrors (or causes) a family's upheavals.
Exquisite stories
The two stories that follow are gems. Completely different in tone and setting, they scream out the need for love and freedom, of belonging and recognition, women's outpourings that yearn for choices within the patriarchal claustrophobia. Bakul Mukhtiar's tale of an extra-marital relationship is sparse and evocative, like the room where the liaisons take place. And Swarnalatha Rangarajan's “Hiranmayi” is a tale lushly told, of an era gone by, child marriages and dark rooms, stark lives lit by hope, wives abandoned by terribly traditional in-laws.Relief comes with Cheryl-Ann Couto's “Slim Pickings”, hilarious and acutely observed, a warmth that dissipates unbelievably in the echoes of an old tragedy. “The Last Supper In Delhi” is elegantly told, of high living in the Capital, of art and partying, surprise end to a year-end celebration. “The Dining Table” is the story of memory and family, and “Bankru't” takes place in Indonesia with discussions about West Bengal's politics and economics, finally reaching an unexpected twist which can only bring resolution.Radha Nair's “A Grand Repast” takes an admiring look at an uncle in a Kerala household, a connoisseur whose fanatic enjoyment of cooked fish is a celebration of life.
Poetic takes
Manash Bhattacharya's three poems use sudden words and conceits, juggling up images and whimsical insight to commemorate love. (“But I remember how you had first/ stirred inside my head like a child/ in a sick mother's womb.”) And Radha Sinha's two poems conclude the book, straightforward and resonant: “Love songs remind me of you and I when we weren't us./ We were mad, free. We were our children./ Now all they do is remind me of what we'll never be.”First Proof 5is a book worth returning to, though one wishes someone had given it a second proof-reading.

189,Flavours of the north-east,RANJITA BISWAS,2010-05-06,19:04:33 IST,"The debate over whether a translated work destroys the flavour of the original is long over, one assumes. Thankfully! Without translation, voices from around the world, excluding English or any major language, would have been confined into cocoons. In India itself, regional literature is of great dimension. But for the translations, lovers of literature would have been in a limbo to taste local flavours.For instance, the Assamese language, mainly spoken in the Brahmaputra Valley has a rich literary tradition. Contemporary Assamese short stories are some of the best in the country today, acknowledge litterateurs basing their view on the limited number of translations available in English.
Varied themes
Well-known journalist and translator Dhirendra Nath Bezboruah's A Game of Chess, a compilation of fifteen stories, gives a glimpse of the richness and variety of themes in modern Assamese short stories. Starting with “The Decision” by Syed Abdul Malik, a path-breaking writer from the 1950s, which etches a delightful cameo of a woman (Aimoni) with a mind of her own, and wrapped up with “Parable of an Ancient Triangle” by young writer Moushumi Kandali on the dilemma of a feminist and her student, the anthology covers a wide range of human situations.Within this range figure some of the most famous short stories in contemporary Assamese language. Bhabendra Nath Saikia, who ushered in a new era in Assamese literature in the 1960s with his insightful observation of the human character and situation, features in three stories. ‘The Cavern” is a sardonic look at such a situation as a White supremacy believer's heart gets transplanted by a Black man's heart and its effect on him, in an oblique reference to South Africa which was still practising Apartheid and where also the world's first heart transplant took place.“A Game of Chess” by Saurabh Kumar Chaliha, known for his eclectic choice of themes, plays another kind of psychological game with two friends, one successful, the other loser, over a chess-board. His “Bonsai” – on modern society's penchant for consumerism and clever marketing ploys by manufacturers with affordable mini versions of products - ‘sachets' of shampoo or coffee available even in rural backwaters, leaves one wondering – would people enjoy mini-literature, mini-bananas, etc?Jnanpith Award winner Indira Goswami's “The Journey”, Atulananda Goswami's “Munni's Legs” and Harekrishna Deka's “The Prisoner” are reflections on the unstable state of affairs in the region due to the long-drawn insurgency and conflict and their effect on ordinary people.Manoj Goswami's sheering “Samiran Borua is on His Way” resonates with the sighs of idealists anywhere, left behind by a society moving on while they themselves lose their youth and home hoping to change an unjust society.
Global feel
The locale of Arupa Patagia Kalita's “A Nymph of the Desert” moves from the lush green valley of Assam to the arid desert of Rajasthan but the theme of urban-rural divide, of anorexic socialites and starving desert women, can be placed anywhere – even today, and perhaps more so in this global-economic village.Apurba Sharma's “Monica and Vikram” drawing on one of the India's famous myth story characters — Betaal and Vikramaditya, to transplant into a modern version is an interesting experiment but the story is too long and at times gets tedious with social comments verging on lectures on social ills.By the translator-editor's own admission, the anthology does not make “claims of ..being a representative collection of any era or period of time” but chosen because he felt ‘impelled' to translate them. “It is possible to have forty or fifty anthologies of good Assamese short stories in translation,” he writes in the preface. Yet the book gives a worthy glimpse into the wealth of this literature from the North East.The meticulous translation with an eye to maintaining the local flavour, a glossary of local words and their meanings, and profiles of the original authors add to the value to the book.

190,Rich encounters,VIJAY NAMBISAN,2010-05-06,19:03:29 IST,"It so happened that I read this book at a time when I was having to speak five languages on a daily basis. None of them was new; but reading this made me aware of what I was doing. I could almost sense the different brain paths in use, and I was certainly sensible of a different cultural approach to each. It was the best way – and one I could never have planned – to appreciate Rich's experience of learning Hindi from scratch.
Writerly forays
Rich's background is with magazines, not academics. Why she chose to learn Hindi is never clearly spelled out. She'd lost her job, and was recovering from cancer. (She wrote an award-winning book about her battle with “The Red Devil”.) She lied to an editor who'd asked her for some freelance work, saying “I'll be in India,” and was told, “Do something for us there.”From Delhi, she was sent to an academy in Udaipur which taught foreign students. She arrived at a difficult time: five days before the attacks on New York, and that was followed in short order by the attack on Parliament, then came Godhra and the subsequent carnage. Her magazine background serves her well. She details with painstaking and sometimes painful honesty her reactions to the hatred spewed by fanatics everywhere, the branding of humans by community. There was then a palpable, shimmering unease in the air which she describes elegantly.Personal relationships are her metier. Her depictions of social dynamics at the language academy, with her various local hosts, among the expats, at a school for deaf children – all these leaven the narrative and make absorbing reading. She also has a gift for concisely expressing complex ideas. What adds great value is her attempts, before and after her Indian sojourn, to pin down the physiology of language skills. She has spoken to and read many experts, with almost as many theories. She offers these lucidly and convincingly where relevant to her story.
An instance, at random:
Recently, a cognitive neurolinguist at the University of Washington made an extraordinary discovery about the extent to which our brains understand more than we can say. [He] scanned neophyte French students… using a device that measures electrical activity in the brain. At two weeks in, after test participants had received only eight hours of instruction, [he] attached electrodes to their scalps and showed them lists of words. Some were French, some made up. When they were asked to say which were which, they did as expected: scored, on average, 50 per cent. They guessed…. But the scans showed their brains were getting the answers right.There are too many such remarkable findings to quote in a review.Rich falls into many of the traps India sets for Westerners. There is the inapposite caste-naming, for example: “the pretty Brahmin teacher”. When she wants to talk to “a dalit”, any dalit, she is warned off by an instructor. Is it so difficult, finding “a dalit”? There are outdated notions of Indian women living a secret life. (This is perhaps not so outdated in Rajasthan. But then she shouldn't talk of “Indian women”.)To be fair, she makes her own bloomers too. She confuses the Indian Congress with the American idea; says south Indian languages are as far from Hindi as English is from Mandarin; describes the charkha as having adorned the Indian flag for many years…. And ye gods, her spellings: “atmaan, Brahmaan”, “mendhi”, “Vidyala” – I wonder why, if Westland must reprint an American book for us, they can't correct these things.Though Rich achieved, in some measure, her dream of dreaming in Hindi, her language skills cannot be very considerable. Her Hindi is of that Sanskritic order which is taught in schools, and rings quaintly to the man in the street. Rajasthan is not the best place to learn the lingua Indica. Her English, too, like that of so many American writers (and Indian journalists), is often found to settle for the approximate rather than the exact. On the same page I find “a trifling” used for “a trifle” and “precedence” for “precedent”.But working polyglots, unlike academics and UN interpreters, need to communicate, not dazzle. It is Rich's journey that is fascinating. She did not undertake it for any material reward (though this book must be selling), but for the excitement of what she discovered along the way. That is its own reward, both for her and the reader. A professional academic would have written a more factually accurate account. She would have used more method. She would also, nine times out of ten, have been boring. It is precisely Rich's peripatetic approach that gives this book its charm. So long as it is not used as a guide – but that is, unfortunately, just how the unwary and lazy will use it. Bhai, zaraa dekhke chalo.

191,Celebrating the academic poet,M.S. NAGARAJAN,2010-05-06,19:01:30 IST,"Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a short anthology of seventy-five “lyrical poems with soft, sensuous and passionate lines” composed on different occasions spanning a period of nearly three decades. She has had the advantage of getting to know, rather intimately, her contemporaries, poets who helped shape her poems, offering suggestions and putting her on the right track.Nissim Ezekiel who was a pathfinder for many of the younger generation brought her into contact with Gieve Patel, Kamala Das, Dom Moraes and others. Arun Kolatkar and Adil Jussawalla too had their bit of role in promoting her poems. More than all, the academic circle she grew up in afforded a lot of exposure to good and great poetry. In this sense, it is right to place her among the group of Indian academic poets of the post-independence era.Her early ‘Catholic' poems from her collection Fix are autobiographical—if not confessional—in nature, helping us gain a peep into the nature of her later poetry.The beliefs and disbeliefs of the Goan-Catholic community of Mumbaikars provide her with enough material for a conducted tour, as it were, of the inner lives of this group of people. “Catholic Mother” provides four biting — if not scornful — snapshots of her family. The father believes that God always provides for that big family of seven young children. According to the parish priest, he is the pillar of the church, and for Mother Superior, it is a lovely Catholic family. The last line that her mother ‘says nothing' is ambivalent. Profoundly intimate, yet aesthetically distant, is the poem an acceptance or a denial of father's role and presence? The poet stands outside in a distanced position from which she can apprehend the fallacies of both positions.Institutionalised religious morality and subjective personal judgments can both fall outside the domain of true experience of human life.Eunice De Souza's poems are narrative in style, simple and direct oftentimes but the ideas they explore are not as simple as all that. The poem “Mid Sentence” from her collection of “Recent Poems” is illustrative of this mode. There is no wailing, no sentimental cries. There is just the banal closing line; ‘It was thoughtless to vanish so suddenly,' referring to the sudden passing away of someone (Finis. Kaput. Dead.) whose identity is not revealed. There is a commingling of a joyous life full of hope and expectation with the sudden close with ‘neither harp nor halo.'The lyric expands the metaphor of the opening line, “You left mid-sentence…” Death looms large in the anthology the title of which (“A Necklace of Skulls”) seems deliberate.The influence of William Blake on Eunice De Souza is unmistakable: the two of the longest poems, “Songs of Survival” and “Songs of Innocence” bear an echo of Blake. But unlike Blake who portrays complementary and opposing views on the transcendent mystery of creation as in “The Lamb” and “The Tyger,” these two companion pieces present related views enquiring into the phenomena of innocence and survival.Standing outside the two perceptions, the poet explores the limitations of being ‘happy with him forever/in this world and the next,' (innocence), while denouncing the self-deprecating attitudes, extols the philosophy of stoicism and the Schopenhauerean virtues of the will to live. The poems of De Souza are well-wrought lyrics, inflexible and firm, short in design. In fact the very economy of utterances helps her in arriving at such a delicately finished form.Full of understatements, avoiding any external aid in the form of conceits, metaphors or symbols, Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a welcome addition to the Indo-Anglian shelf.

192,Too many loose ends,SAAZ AGGARWAL,2010-05-06,18:59:44 IST,"The House on Mall Road
  Parvati is 27-years-old and this is the story of a journey she makes to try and find out what exactly happened 20 years ago when tragedy irretrievably changed her circumstances.Travelling with her, we learn something about life in an army cantonment near the border and the dangers that we, sitting comfortably curled up and reading novels, are safe from. The discipline, the atmosphere of wide spaces, smartly-uniformed personnel of every rank, the abundance of various resources, the monotonous routine, the deceptively jolly and rotund officers (eagle-eyed and razor-sharp is what they really are) and the wonderfully warm but empty-headed and appearance-obsessed women (yes, some of them can be vicious and career-ruining spiteful too) are plainly described. We also discern shades of the emotional spectrum of army life – not just pride in country and fearlessness in the face of peril but also the unique conflicts within the ranks and between other groups such as police and civilians, and the classless society formed by people from so many different backgrounds.Romance enters Parvati’s story in a straightforward way but you will wait in vain for what would once have been a logical conclusion. And while you may consider this the mark of a modern story, in many ways, and particularly in its use of language, this book is anachronistic.What is it about the IIM-A novelists? Is it that difficult to put a good story together using a healthy, global – or even consistently local – idiom? With Chetan Bhagat, the story roars along without even pretending to strive for a style that could be admired. This book, on the other hand, has nothing that either Wren or Martin could object to. However, it is strewn with dated expressions like “attaché” case and “reel” for photo film roll; malapropisms as in “I am mortified of snakes”; ill-chosen adjectives as in “no offence to your fabulous profession” and the word “nice” (which shrewd writers will display before a reviewer only, and only, as a remedy for constipation) FOUR TIMES on one page – oh my god! Occasional lapses into new age concepts (“personal boundaries”; “but in a nice way”) evoke the precocious child trying out a new word, proud and a little self-conscious.If your benchmark of a good book is that, from one end to the other, you feel the characters as real people and can experience them change or grow, you will have one more reason to feel disappointed. The people here are static and at most capable of performing random unexpected acts. The narrator herself fails to claim your being, as a skilled narrator would – she’s somewhat shadowy, a tinselly voice and at best a collection of opinions.I did enjoy the series of implausible coincidences (but then truth is always stranger than fiction) and the surge of emotion towards the end of the book. However, too many loose ends were left hanging: strange happenings that are never explained and even the ghost of someone who hadn’t died after all. This book lacks the grace of a natural story. If I wasn’t reading it as a reviewer, I would never have carried on to the end.Reading Pico Iyer’s enthusiastic endorsement on the cover, I had grabbed it with excitement, anticipating the matchless pleasure of reading a wonderful first book by a talented new writer of fiction. As I read, however, excitement turned to disbelief, and then to annoyance.I’ve always been a fan of Pico Iyer’s elegant writing style. His words flow smooth and pleasing, unassuming, and often stunningly effective. I’m afraid that his description of this mediocre, clumsily-written story as “a rich and wonderfully-accomplished debut” made me wonder what sort of pressure exactly he had been under when he made it.

193,No mystery here,PARVATHI NAYAR,2010-05-06,18:58:02 IST,"The Swan Thieves by Elizabeth Kostova
  Elizabeth Kostova’s retelling of the Dracula myth, The Historian (2005), was a runaway success, a doubly creditable feat considering it was her debut novel. Logical then that she has returned to the same idea of the historical thriller with a literary bent in her latest, The Swan Thieves. Here, she turns her talents to another myth that has captured public imagination since ancient times – that of the tortured genius artist.Cleverly, Kostova sets her mystery within the time period of an enduringly popular art “ism” – i.e., Impressionism. It’s not just the continuing beauty and craftsmanship of the works that make the Impressionists so fascinating, but also that the artists were rebels of their time, who dared to see and paint things differently, thereby challenging the popular idiom.
The Swan Thieves follows two story lines that unfold through multiple voices, letters and journals. In the past lies the tale of Beatrice de Clerval, an unsung Impressionist genius of 19th-century Paris. But de Clerval’s influence extends in a mysterious manner all the way to the present - and indirectly changes forever, the lives of many people including that of the book’s chief narrator, painter/psychiatrist Dr. Andrew Marlow.Dr. Marlow’s skill lies is inducing people to open up; we are told he has the ability to get “a stone to talk”. As a result, a strange new patient is admitted into his care, the talented artist Robert Oliver. Oliver is described as a traditionalist - “I actually don’t care about concepts very much,” he growls, preferring instead to draw traditional landscapes, portraits and still lives - but with such facility that even the unforgiving avant-garde art world of the present day cannot help but recognise his talent.Oliver gets into psychiatric treatment after apparently attacking a painting depicting Leda and the swan at the National Gallery with a knife. But after an initial conversation, Oliver doesn’t break his stony silence with Dr. Marlow – which apart from anything else, calls into serious question the doctor’s ability to engage rocks and boulders in meaningful conversation.At the psychiatric facility of Goldengrove in Rockville, Oliver mostly seems to engage in activity of the “pacing the room… clenching and unclenching his jaw” genre. He also draws and paints a mysterious woman over and over – and over – again. Though painted directly from his imagination with no model, these drawings were “alive, beyond alive” we are told in hushed prose. But since Oliver refuses to talk, his motives are a mystery to all concerned. Frankly, however, as we plough through over 500 pages of narrative of how Oliver has put several people through a lot of misery thanks to his self-absorbed ways as some sort of possessed genius, we stop caring too much about the tortured artist’s misery.Dr. Marlow himself is not the most appetising of protagonists and his eye for a pretty face is, well, a bit weird. Admittedly he is pursuing Oliver’s former loves – real and imaginary – in the name of detecting, uncovering the mystery and curing his patient. However he seems far more smitten by Oliver’s women than trying to help his patient. Kostova, actually, has a thing going with age in her book, what with nubile young women constantly falling for generationally older men throughout her narrative. Some of the women also give up on their art for reasons related to the men in their lives.Almost every major character in the book draws and paints – but each of their painterly visions come off sounding disconcertingly alike. It’s hard to tell the voices apart and as a result the characterisations aren’t distinct. At one level this makes the book a bit of a uniform and plodding read – at another, this homogenisation deeply undercuts the book’s belief in the artist as an individual who sees the world differently and expresses this vision in deeply distinctive ways.Kostova tries hard to evoke the mystery of creating art as she plots out the mystery in her novel, but the descriptions sound laboured. It is a subject many authors have attempted, but the truth of the matter is that writing about painting really isn’t an easy task – it is the same ambitious leap as trying to paint what’s written between the covers of a book.

194,My name is Khan,ANVAR ALIKHAN,2010-05-06,18:55:39 IST,"Home Boy by H.M. Naqvi
  Someone e-mailed me this joke recently: In New York’s Central Park, a huge Rottweiler breaks loose from its leash and savages a small blonde child. A skinny young man rushes up and, at great risk to himself, saves the child by wrestling the dog to the ground and finally, in desperation, killing it.When it’s all over, the child’s mother comes up to the little bloodied man and thanks him profusely. It turns out she’s a famous journalist and she tells him she’s going to run a front page story about him in the New York Times headlined, “American hero saves child from vicious monster”. “But madam, I’m not American,” the little man replies. “Oh, what are you then?” asks the journalist. “I’m a Pakistani, madam”.So the next day’s New York Times carries a screaming headline, “Terrorist strangles pet dog”.No, it is not a great time to be a Pakistani. Your country is collapsing around you; your political system is one of the most rotten in the world; your society is fractured down the centre; the religious loonies are baying at the gates of your home. For many years Pakistanis who had the talent or the means usually chose to escape overseas, but in today’s world the ‘T’ word hangs threateningly over their heads wherever they go. And that is what Husain Naqvi’s Home Boy is all about.Boulevardiers and raconteursIt’s the story of three Pakistani 20-somethings living in Manhattan: Shehzad (“Chuck”), an investment banker; Jimbo, a hip-hop deejay; and AC, a dilettante and intellectual bum. They are “boulevardiers, raconteurs, renaissance men.” They hang around their favourite Tribeca bar-lounge, drinking vodka-on-the-rocks with a gaggle of socialites, arrivistes, metro-sexuals and wannabe models. They work; they play; they listen to Afro-jazz; they get in and out of trouble; they make pilgrimages to Jackson Heights to eat kabab-roti. But the theme that always seems to be playing in the background is the situation back home and “Hey-I-believe-Musharraf-is-making-an-important–speech-on-TV-today-don’t-miss-it.”After 9/11, however, the world is not the same for someone with a brown skin and a Muslim name. The three boulevardiers do something silly and the next thing they know is they’re blindfolded and squatting on the floor of a detention centre. Their homes are raided; a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook on the bookshelf is construed to be a bomb-making manual; Ibn Khaldun’s great philosophical classic Muqadimah is made out to be some kind of Islamic terror guide. And suddenly there’s an enormous FBI interrogator looming over them, saying “No phone call, no lawyer, no nothing. And if you’re lucky someday we’ll put you on a plane with a one-way ticket to Bumfuckistan. So let’s start again….” In today’s world, it’s something that could easily happen to you, or to me.
Stylish and eclectic
Naqvi writes with a stylishness and eclecticism that is so self-assured it’s almost arrogant: the fact that the book opens upon three selected quotes - the first from F. Scott Fitzgerald, the second from Urdu poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and the third from hip-hop artists, Eric B. & Rakim - is just an indication of the shape of things to come. But then Naqvi is a man who grew up in Algiers, graduated from Georgetown University, worked as an investment banker, has been a slam poet, and taught creative writing at Boston University. In fact he claims that Home Boy actually began as a slam poem, scribbled on a cocktail napkin in 1993, after his brother was routinely picked up by the cops for interrogation. And it’s that slam poet’s instinct that buzzes below the book’s sharp, sleek prose and its tightly wrought structure.
Home Boy was selected as one of the top 10 novels of the year by the Huffington Post, alongside Orhan Pamuk’s The Museum of Innocence and Ha Jin’s A Great Fall. So if I say it is one of the richest, most stylish novels I’ve read in a long time, I am in good company.

195,High voltage drama,MITA GHOSE,2010-05-06,18:53:33 IST,"The Last Victory
  Exploring this novel is somewhat like opening a carefully preserved album of beautiful images and wondering if they’ll survive the harsh light of scrutiny. Any work of fiction that dares to toy with the historical past risks courting that danger. And the final days of the Raj, in particular — the subject of The Last Victory — has inspired so many memorable tomes that yet another novel, which gives it pride of place would, one imagines, invite more intense critical attention than most.But Timeri N. Murari’s grand Raj production (for that is how this sequel to The Imperial Agent comes across) will probably get away unscathed. Its meticulously researched historical backdrop notwithstanding, the book adroitly escapes being judged by the criteria that would apply to a historical novel. The thoroughness of this research is evident as the author weaves his suspense-charged fictional episodes around real-life events — among them, World War I and the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre — and smoothly incorporates personalities like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru into his narrative, making them come alive in imagined sequences, even if there is a tendency towards stereotyping in the delineation of such characters as General Reginald Dyer of Jallianwallah Bagh notoriety who vows to “teach the bloody wogs a lesson they’ll never forget”.Murari’s most inspired writing comes, however, from his portrait of another India, the one that happily accommodates demons and double agents, patriot-terrorists turned “
sanyasis” and brigands who rule the Chambal’s ravines, island palaces and temples to the snake god, hired assassins lurking in the shadows and zamindars who conspire from their thrones of ivory “the colour of fading sunlight”, evil spells and local superstitions and, of course, those rare and wondrous beings, Bala and Bala, blind twins with the power to transform people and places through their magical songs so that they are never again the same. In other words, oodles of exotica that lend the story the innocent charm of a fairy tale, while playing quite unabashedly on the old Western fixation — perpetuated partly by Hollywood — with the Orient’s supposedly unfathomable mystique.Appropriately enough, the hero is an “
Angrezi” born, but Indian “by love and thought”. Resurrected by the author from Kim, Rudyard Kipling’s creation, Kimball O’Hara is “a friend of the world”, brave, honourable and compassionate, with an embarrassing resemblance to the yesteryear Hollywood heroes some of us had massive crushes on long, long ago and now condescend to remember with a self-deprecating smile. It’s inevitable that Murari’s Kim, who takes up from where he had left off in The Imperial Agent, should be required in this novel to elude assassins, battle dacoits, fight superstition, exorcise demons and stand up to his former mentor, Colonel Creighton, who swears by Rule Britannia and would, if necessary, betray his own protégé to safeguard the interests of the Empire.It’s no surprise either that Kim’s love interest should be the beautiful Mohini/ Parvati, the original damsel in distress who can, when required, be bold enough to engage in anti-colonial activities, flee a brutal husband, love a man from another race (even if her romantic interludes with him are frustratingly chaste), bear him a child out of wedlock and ultimately carry out an act we wouldn’t have dreamed her capable of, so weepy and whisper-soft has her creator rendered her, the perfect prototype, it would seem, of the demure Oriental maiden with great hidden potential.Add Murari’s rich gallery of cameos and red-hot action sequences interspersed with lyrical passages and you have a potent, if quaint, cocktail of entertainment.It’s not difficult to understand why this author’s popularity has endured over the decades, despite changing literary tastes. Murari can remain secure in the knowledge that The Last Victory offers much, including some great celluloid moments that will lure us into a willing suspension of disbelief so that going with the flow follows naturally. Despite the faint whiff of mothballs, there’s much to be said, after all, for a reassuringly linear narrative, larger-than-life characters, a generous slice of realism, both magical and otherwise, high-voltage drama and an assured prose style that adapts itself easily to the demands of the context and is as invigorating as a breath of fresh air.

196,Against the tyranny of facts,SUBASH JEYAN,2010-05-06,18:52:04 IST,"Lest we forget: Yann Martel. Photo: MACARENA YANEZ
  
Yann Martel's second novel has been a long time coming. Recently released in Canada and the US, 
Beatrice and Virgil
 has received polarised reviews. That it has been trashed as well as praised, he says, is a sign that it has elicited active engagement, not indifference, from the readers. The controversial reception is a sign that it is getting people to think and act, he says from San Francisco where he is on a promotional tour. Excerpts from a telephonic conversation...
Are you planning on coming to India to promote the book here?
I have a nine-month-old son. Before I can promote it — I am not going to Australia, New Zealand — I want to get back and be with my son. So, as much as I would love to return to India, for any reason, not just to promote my books, just to be in India — I haven't been there for about nine years now — I don't know when that'll be. India has changed a lot, I would love to go back and see that.
Is this novel about the primacy of the imagination? You think we live in a world where the profusion of facts is working against making sensible meaning out of it?
Reality is a 100 million details. Right now where you are, if you think about it, you are surrounded by 100 million details on which you could focus your attention. Everything, from chemical, scientific details to cultural details to personal emotional details... now some of that has to be lost. Time, you know, is an eraser. It all goes. [We need] something we can hold on to. It's called history. But even history has hundreds of thousands of details and sometimes it's overwhelming and it's hard to get to. The forte of the arts, the forte of the imagination is that it can take some of those details and give them immortality. A painting, a story, a song can float across the ocean of time like a lifeboat. So you can get to the essence of an event and convey it in the form of art. It can be like a suitcase, taking the essential and preparing you for a trip to elsewhere...
Does ‘getting to the essence' necessarily bring a moral perspective that is lacking in mere facts?
It can be but art isn't necessarily moral. Art could be immoral too. Art is witness. But in some stories, yes, it can also have a moral edge. It can also, in telling a story, convey certain moral situations. Which is what my novel does at the very end — In “Games for Gustav” are these 12 situations that are morally, existentially difficult. So, yes, it can make a moral situation fresh again...
You dwell at length in the initial stages of the novel about the concrete, everyday circumstances around writing /publishing that are usually glossed over. Is it autobiographical and are you saying that though there is a market built around imagination, it is essential to our being and identity?
I didn't do it because I wanted it to be autobiographical, it was more because of the idea of a writer who stops writing, whose message has stopped, suited me because I was discussing the Holocaust. And any great horrific event, the Holocaust, war, has a tendency to erase language, to make us at a loss for words. You know, famously, when people encountered the Accounts, their language was full of clichés to do with “there are no words to describe”, “I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing.” So, to have a writer who is at a loss for words and then to meet the taxidermist who is also in some ways at a loss for words suited my purpose when discussing the Holocaust...so that's why I have that theme.I did indeed have a meeting with my publishers, I did want to do a flip book with them but their argument was different. They were saying, “listen, an essay is a specialised product. A novel is not.” They were afraid the essay would drag down the novel.
You keep coming back to the notion that is art is about joy. The taxidermist is shown as someone who is joyless, cheerless, who plods through his play. “My story has no story. It is based on the fact of murder,” he says at one point. You think the character of the taxidermist is too steretypical, he and the novelist falling easily into opposite sides of a too-easy divide?
Art is joy in a general way. Any art, music, dance, painting, to create at that level is deeply joyful, it involves your whole being. Art and religion are the two ways in which we fully engage with life. In this particular case, I enjoyed wrestling with that subject. I wanted to make the taxidermist ambiguous. He clearly has some sort of a creative impulse, he is working on a play, he is quite rude with the writer. I wanted someone whom we wouldn't understand why he was doing the things he was doing until the very end and even then we are not sure what his intent was.And that to me was the parallel of the encounter of the Jews of Europe with the Nazis who did not see it coming. By the time they realised fully what the Nazis' intents were, it was too late, they couldn't escape and that's why so many died.
How has the novel been received?
It's been very interesting and very polarised. Some critics absolutely hated it. I got absolutely trashed by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and there's some blogger on the Internet named Edward Champion who absolutely hated it. And then you have reviewers who absolutely loved it. The USA Today thought it was positively a masterpiece. There were very positive reviews in Newsweek and the LA Times. So it's been very polarised, which is good. The one thing you don't want with art is indifference. You don't want people to shrug. Even when people hate it, they are engaging with it.
Is there some sort of thematic continuity or evolution between 
Life of Pi
 and 
Beatrice and Virgil

? If the former was about God, faith and religion, the latter is about imagination and art, isn't it?In some ways they are very different books. Yes, they both feature animals but that's just on the surface. In Life of Pi hopefully the reader loses himself looking at those animals. Forget may be his humanity. In Beatrice and Virgil those animals are anthropomorphised and are meant to bring us back to our humanity.And as for the role of the imagination, to me it's something more immediate like life itself is an interpretation. We cannot choose the reality we live in, but we can choose how we interpret it. In that sense, imagination is not something whimsical, fairy-tale like, I am simply saying that reality is a co-creation, reality is something which is out there but it is also how you take it. To that extent, I suppose there is a similarity between the two novels in the sense that how you represent reality will speak of how you see it, of what that reality is. A person of faith reads transcendendance into the world, sees a divine plan; I suppose it is the same with reading history. You are representing an event that is past, and in that representation there is an element of interpretation, of imaginative reading. In that way there is a thematic link between the two novels.
To me this novel seems to come behind a line of books from the West dealing with the Holocaust. Why this obsession in the West about the Holocaust? There are historical continuities to the Holocaust in the contemporary world like what is happening in Palestine, Gaza today, injustices, perhaps of equal magnitude. Nobody seems to talk about them much...
Well, aside of the politics of West Asia, which poisons everything, just looking in terms of history, the Holocaust still remains unique: every other genocide before and after has to some extent been politically expedient. The Armenians in Turkey were killed because they were in the way of the Turks who were trying to start their nation. Excesses in Gaza were committed because of political enmity between the Palestinians and the Israelis. In both cases you killed people who were in the way, who bothered you but the ones beyond a certain border were irrelevant to you. But the Nazis were obsessed with killing the Jews everywhere, as if they were a disease. That does remain unique. And the reason I think it is still relevant, not a piece of historical arcana from several years ago in the backwaters of Poland, is because what led to the Holocaust is still absolutely contemporary.The act of hate, the thinking of hatred, the disrespect in the mind of an individual that eventually in Germany led to the Holocaust, that little beginning, that seed of hatred is found everywhere. The Holocaust is not rooted in Auschwitz, in Poland. It is rooted in the human heart. And that applies to India too. There are people in India with holocaustal thinking, for example the BJP, the Shiv Sena, you know, that kind of hatred of the other whom you don't even know, who is just a construction in your mind to relieve tension, to relieve whatever... that is holocaustal. Now because India is democracy, there is a free press, it is unlikely that there will ever be a genocide but the roots are there...The thing about this novel is that it is not an orthodox Holocaust novel. There is no history in there, there are no Germans, there is minimal reference to the Holocaust yet it is soaked in it.So I do choose the Holocaust but not just as a historical artefact, I am looking at what is to me relevant. At the very end, there are 12 more situations where there is no historical colour or detail that put you at the heart of it. And those 12 situations could take place in India. You could be in a line of people about to be executed and you could be holding your grand daughter's hand and she asks you a question. And what might that question be? What would a child be thinking when it sees people being massacred? That completely fits in with realities in India today. That's why I think it's still relevant...
Exclusive excerpts from Yann Martel's 
Beatrice and Virgil

…
(Virgil and Beatrice are sitting at the foot of the tree. They are looking out blankly. Silence
.)
Virgil: What I'd give for a pear.

Beatrice: A pear?

Virgil: Yes. A ripe and juicy one.

Beatrice: I've never had a pear.

Virgil: What?

Beatrice: In fact, I don't think I've ever set eyes on one.

Virgil: How is that possible? It's a common fruit.

Beatrice: My parents were always eating apples and carrots. I guess they didn't like pears.

Virgil: But pears are so good! I bet you there's a pear tree right around here. (He looks about.)

Beatrice: Describe a pear for me. What is a pear like?

Virgil: (settling back) I can try. Let's see . . . To start with, a pear has an unusual shape. It's round and fat on the bottom, but tapered on top.

Beatrice: Like a gourd.

Virgil: A gourd
? You know gourds but you don't know pears? How odd the things we know and don't. At any rate, no, a pear is smaller than an average gourd, and its shape is more pleasing to the eye. A pear becomes tapered in a symmetrical way, its upper half sitting straight and centred atop its lower half. Can you see what I mean?
Beatrice: I think so.

Virgil: Let's start with the bottom half. Can you imagine a fruit that is round and fat?

Beatrice: Like an apple?

Virgil: Not quite. If you look at an apple with your mind's eye, you will notice that the girth of the apple is at its widest either in the middle of the fruit or in the top third, isn't that so?

Beatrice: You're right. A pear is not like this?

Virgil: No. You must imagine an apple that is at its widest in the bottom third.

Beatrice: I can see it.

Virgil: But we must not push the comparison too far. The bottom of a pear is not like an apple's.

Beatrice: No?

Virgil: No. Most apples sit on their buttocks, so to speak, on a circular ridge or on four or five points that keep them from falling over. Past the buttocks, a little ways up, there's what would be the anus of the fruit if the fruit were a beast.

Beatrice: I see precisely what you mean.

Virgil: Well, a pear is not like that. A pear has no buttocks. Its bottom is round.

Beatrice: So how does it stay up?

Virgil: It doesn't. A pear either dangles from a tree or lies on its side.

Beatrice: As clumsy as an egg.

Virgil: There's something else about the bottom of a pear: most pears do not have those vertical grooves that some apples have. Most pears have smooth, round, even bottoms.

Beatrice: How enchanting.

Virgil: It certainly is. Now let us move north past our fruity equator.

Beatrice: I'm following you.

Virgil: There comes this tapering I was telling you about.

Beatrice: I can't quite see it. Does the fruit come to a point? Is it shaped like a cone?

Virgil: No. Imagine the tip of a banana.

Beatrice: Which tip?

Virgil: The end tip, the one you hold in your hand when you're eating one.

Beatrice: What kind of banana? There are hundreds of varieties.

Virgil: Are there?

Beatrice: Yes. Some are as small as fat fingers, others are real clubs. And their shapes vary too, as do their taste.

Virgil: I mean the regular, yellow ones that taste really good.

Beatrice: The common banana, M. sapientum
. You probably have the Gros Michel variety in mind.
Virgil: I'm impressed.

Beatrice: I know bananas.

Virgil: Better than a monkey. Take the end tip of a common banana, then, and place it on top of an apple, taking into account the differences between apples and pears that I've just described.

Beatrice: An interesting graft.

Virgil: Now make the lines smoother, gentler. Let the banana flare out in a friendly way as it merges into the apple. Can you see it?

Beatrice: I believe I can.

Virgil: One last detail. At the very top of this apple-banana composite, add a surprisingly tough stalk, a real tree trunk of a stalk. There, you have an approximation of a pear.

Beatrice: A pear sounds like a beautiful fruit.

Virgil: It is. In colour, commonly, a pear is yellow with black spots.

Beatrice: Like a banana again.

197,Questions of identity,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,18:49:20 IST,"Aatish Taseer's The Temple-goers
  The narrator of Aatish Taseer’s debut novel is a young man named Aatish Taseer, and some of the details of his life appear drawn from the author’s. The device is guaranteed to raise questions about exactly how “autobiographical” The Temple-goers is (as if such things are neatly quantifiable), but that would be to miss the wood for the trees; this is a book that encourages us to ask subtler – and more interesting – questions about identity.The fictional Aatish is a young writer born to privilege. After a few years studying and working in America and England he’s just returned to Delhi to revise a novel, and he has access to two apartments – his mother’s and his girlfriend Sanyogita’s – in the high-end colonies that border Lutyen’s Delhi. A citizen of the world, Aatish is estranged from non-cosmopolitan India, and always conscious of – and uneasy about – this estrangement.This is reflected early on, in the book’s descriptions. When he writes about places like Jorbagh and Lodhi Gardens, he does it with precision and familiarity. But he’s on less firm ground with other parts of Delhi, including its growing satellite towns, and the novel is deliberately non-specific about those parts. Instead of Noida or Ghaziabad, they are given the abstract names “Sectorpur” and “Phasenagar”. The impression one gets is of a city map where the posh colonies of south-central Delhi are in sharp relief but the names get blurred as the map spreads outwards, until the satellite towns are anonymous smudges: unknowable and frightening places to someone who has led a sheltered life.We are prepared, then, for the fascination Aatish feels towards the book’s other major figure, a fitness trainer named Aakash who lives in a lower-income-group flat in Sectorpur. “Double A like me!” Aakash exclaims when he learns Aatish’s name, the first time they meet, but gradually we will come to see how Aakash himself is something of a double, a doppelganger for our narrator. He’s a developed character in his own right, but it’s also possible to see him as a figure born in Aatish’s subconscious, threatening and attractive in equal measure. As a high-caste Brahmin, seemingly very sure of his place in the world, he is an object of envy, and Aatish’s descriptions of him have a ring of awe (“His small, powerful body hovered over mine, the rope of black religious strings hanging down like a noose…”). When he shows up – as a security guard – at an upper-crust Holi party where Aatish is a guest, and later, when he invites himself to Aatish’s flat, there is a hint of rupture, of one world intruding on another.Their improbable friendship deepens: Aatish goes on a day trip with Aakash and his family to an ancestral village temple; later, he accompanies him to the home of a middle-aged prostitute where they share a different sort of intimacy. Aatish’s interest in his new friend’s life may suggest a novelist collecting material for his next book, but it’s just as likely that he is trying to understand himself and the country he wants badly to belong to.
The Temple-goers is a carefully crafted book in which even seemingly marginal scenes (such as a description of a writers’ meet where a young man reads out a short story that may or may not be an account of a real-life incident) become significant in retrospect. This carefulness can also be seen in its examination of identity – national, communal and personal.In his first book Stranger to History, Taseer – whose estranged father is a Pakistani Muslim – described his journeys through various Islamic countries to try and understand how the religion manifests itself in different places. The Temple-goers is, in part, a complementary examination of Hinduism, a religion that had pagan roots and was not founded on a fixed belief system; the repercussions – good and bad – of this fluidity; and the growing danger of it being overtaken by fundamentalist forces today.At one point, Aatish’s Urdu teacher Zafar uses the word “
vehshat” to describe India’s “history of animalism and sacrifice”, which he associates with the majority religion. “The land is stained,” he says, “It has seen terrible things: girl children sacrificed, widows burned, the worship of idols.” We are reminded of his words in a later passage set during a jagran, where the master of ceremonies cheerfully tells a story involving the sacrifice of a young boy – and still later, when a gruesome murder takes place in Sectorpur.But it’s equally clear that this is just one perspective, and The Temple-goers offers us others. In one very entertaining passage, ideas of India are bandied about at a dinner party where a V.S. Naipaul-like figure – a writer named Vijaipal – holds centre-stage. Responding to the popular liberal-intellectual stand that India isn’t really a single country at all – that the common man from Gujarat, Assam or Tamil Nadu wouldn’t have the faintest idea of India as a land – this writer declaims that the temple-going Indian “knows this country backwards. He forever carries an idea of it in his head…He knows it through its holy places…there is almost no other country, certainly not one so vast, where the countrymen are as acquainted with the distant reaches of the land through their pilgrimages as they are in India”.Persuasive though this monologue is, the reader might well wonder whether this generic “temple-goer” really is a pan-Indian creature or if what we’re talking about here is again a very specific variety of north Indian religious chauvinism. But then, one of this book’s achievements is that it presents forceful ideas without necessarily throwing in its lot with any of them. The fictional Aatish may have a clear sense of what the future will hold for Indians like him – and for Indians like Aakash – but the real Taseer doesn't give us a broad, over-simplified view of a vast, contradiction-ridden country.

198,The other side of history,ABDULLAH KHAN,2010-05-06,18:46:32 IST,"Susan Abulhawa's book
  The creation of Israel, for Jews, was the fulfilment of 3000 years of yearnings for a Jewish homeland. For Palestinians, it was El Nakba, the catastrophe, which rendered them homeless and forced them, to live in perpetual misery. The Jewish version of the Israel-Palestine story has found a place in English fiction umpteen times; the most popular being Exodus by Leon Uris, a book that generated a huge wave of sympathy in the U.S. for the state of Israel. But there was no novel of mass appeal originally written in English, on this issue from the Palestinian perspective until Susan Abulhawa decided to write one. 
The catastrophe Mornings in Jenin opens in 1941 and centres on a Palestinian family, the Abulhejas, a happy farming family in a picturesque and serene village named Ein Hod near Haifa. But their happiness comes to an abrupt end with the birth of Israel seven years later, as they are forcibly evicted from the land of their forefathers and made to live in a refugee camp in Jenin.  In Jenin, Amal Abulheja, the chief protagonist, is born. With her, we embark on a journey through the tumultuous history of post-1948 Palestine. In between, we also witness the personal losses Amal suffers: her father goes away never to return, her mother becomes insane, her husband is killed in a bombing, her sister-in-law and niece are slaughtered during a massacre and much more. When the journey ends after 325 pages, we are left wondering: How can someone be so brutal to his fellow human beings? How can the victims of a Holocaust metamorphose overnight into the instigators of a catastrophe? How do some people not lose their humanity even in times of extreme adversity? Of course, the book is a work of fiction but the events, from the forceful dispossession of Palestinians in 1948 to the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982, are facts, and many real people inhabit this story of heartbreak, exile, and human tragedy.
Poetic prose
What struck me most is the honesty of the author’s voice. Despite being born to Palestinian refugees of the Six Day War of 1967, she has tried hard not to let her personal feelings fill the text. All individual Jewish characters are portrayed in sympathetic light. Nowhere in the story has she lost the touch of humanity. Another bright aspect of Susan’s writing is her ornamental use of language in the tradition of contemporary Arabic writing. For instance, here is a taste of the opening paragraph from the chapter, ‘‘The Harvest’’: In a distant time, before history marched over the hills and shattered present and future, before wind grabbed the land at one corner and shook it of its name and character, before Amal was born, a small village east of Haifa lived quietly on figs and olives, open frontiers and sunshine. In the nutshell, it is a remarkable novel, which will help us to understand the Israel-Palestine conflict better.

“Suddenly there came through the open window the sound of sweet music. Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust. And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, “Go on, little nightingale, go on.”
The nightingale in Hans Christian Andersen's tale is iconic of the life-spirit story-telling has always been.Andersen also foresaw through the tale the fate of genuine art, thought and expression. Earlier in the story, a toy nightingale which always sings the same song in the same vein gets an overwhelming approval rating from his crafty courtiers and his people. The problem: None of them had heard a real nightingale!It is like the fate of classic writings and great literature today. The massive difference in the situation from just a couple of decades ago is striking. To see the real collapse however you will have to peep a little into the vernacular world of contemporary Telugu publishing and reading, and ratings!Why do the classics matter at all? Gandhi Annapaneni realised the difference they make to society during his two years stay as an international student in the erstwhile Soviet Russia. The lack of translations of classic writings especially from the sciences and social sciences in local languages throughout Africa and Asia was a glaring contrast from the situation in Europe. “Accessing and understanding the great ideas and concepts through your own language matters a lot in creating a sturdy intellectual foundation and building up native confidence,” says Gandhi. Considerable good work was done in the decades preceding and following independence in many languages in India but it was primarily focused on bringing in literary works. Even that has become a trickle now.Remarkably, Gandhi's cherished project took shape and evolved amidst such exceedingly adverse climate. By that time sales of ‘serious' Telugu books had plummeted dramatically. Telugu publishing houses had to survive, as they still do, on a hot-mix of vaastu, astrology, religion, personality development and books for competitive exams.The range and variety of the 58 well-translated and attractively produced books in Telugu which Gandhi has brought out in the last five years under the Peacock Classics label, aided of course by a small band of friends and well-wishers, comes as an exceedingly pleasant delight. It is a fine mix of philosophy, science, constitutional law, mythology, folk tales, children's literature and literary classics — ancient, medieval, modern, Indian and foreign. Finding suitable translators who could bring out the essentials of the original in lucid and contemporary Telugu was the most difficult task Gandhi had to face. His persistence shows in the results.Sales figures, though un-encouraging, have not disappointed Gandhi too much. Kaalam Katha, a translation of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time for instance has had seven editions (each 1000 copies). About ten titles including Amma (Maxim Gorky) have done modestly well. The books are priced reasonably. “Yet, most of the target audience for these books, especially in the student community either do not have the resources or are unwilling to spend on books”, feels Gandhi.“The public library system in Andhra Pradesh is no more what it used to be yet there are still 1500 functional libraries spread over the state. So we are inviting people who feel passionately about Telugu and good books in Telugu to pick any work choose any title of their choice from a list of 40 books. The books will be reprinted (with the donor's name) and the copies donated directly to the public libraries,” reveals Gandhi.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Connecting-to-the-classics/article16298720.ece

  My Name is Gauhar Jaan!- The Life and times of a musician, the biography of the first Indian who recorded her voice, was released by Governor of Andhra Pradesh E.S.L. Narasimhan in Chennai on Wednesday.“Reading the book left me with a strange mix of sadness and happiness,” said the Governor.“When Gauhar Jaan excels, you feel happy and when she goes through pangs of separation, pangs of deprivation you feel sad,” he said, adding that the author's in-depth research into various aspects and places is in fact mind boggling, given the constraints of availability of time/material and far flung places.The Governor said “books like these bring back history to the modern generation and provide you a sense of pride in your rich heritage and culture and does leave an impact on the reader.”N. Murali, Senior Managing Director, Kasturi & Sons Ltd, said the book was in line with the current trend of documenting the life of great musicians, while earlier it was considered that art was higher than the artists.“Gauhar Jaan used technology to liberate herself from the exploitation in the hands of patrons of arts. She really democratised music and she was ahead of her time,” he said, recalling how male musicians of earlier days refused to record their voice fearing that doing so would affect their voice.Author of the book Vikram Sampath said Gauhar Jaan visited Chennai in 1910 and her concert in Victoria Hall was a great success. Enthralled by her music, Veena Dhanammal hosted a dinner and she even taught her a Thyagaraja Keertha in suruti raag. Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar learnt a few bhajans from her. She cut close to 600 records. V.

  | Photo Credit: Judi Bottoni In a rare coincidence, researchers working in both Turkey and Iran discovered on the same day how a rare species of bee builds its nest with petals of pink, yellow, blue and purple flowers.The females from the solitary species Osima (Ozbekosima) avoseta line the nest's brood chambers with petals that provide nutrients for the larvae to grow and mature and protect the next generation as they wait out the winter.“It was absolute synchronicity that we all discovered this uncommon behaviour on the same day,” says Jerome Rozen, curator in the division of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History.“In this species, a female shingles the wall of her brood chambers with large pieces of petals or with whole petals, often of many hues,” says Mr. Rozen.“Unfortunately, her larvae never enjoy the brilliant colours of the nest's walls because they have no eyes - and, anyhow, they would need a flashlight!” he said.Mr. Rozen and colleagues were working near Antalya, Turkey while another group of researchers were in the field in Fars Province, Iran.“I'm very proud of the fact that so many authors contributed to this paper,” Mr. Rozen said.Bees are the most important animal pollinators living today and many flowering plants depend on them to reproduce.But nearly 75 percent of bee species - there are about 20,000 species described - are solitary.This means that for the majority of bees, a female constructs a nest for herself and provisions each chamber in the nest with food for the larval stage of her brood.When each chamber is ready, the female deposits an egg and closes the nest if there is only one chamber to a nest, says a release of the American Museum of Natural History.The nests - found in the open - need to be protected from any number of potential threats to their physical structure like compaction of the soil, desiccation, or excessive heating.The survival of solitary bee species also depends on protection from moulds, viruses, bacteria, parasites, and predators.The research was published in American Museum Novitates.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Bee-species-that-builds-its-nest-with-petals/article16298780.ece

During 12 years of follow-up, 125 husbands and 70 wives developed dementia, and both the husband and wife developed dementia in 30 couples.After adjusting for a number of factors, the researchers found that people with a spouse who developed dementia were six times more likely to develop dementia themselves than people whose spouses never had dementia. Men had a higher risk than women. Older age was also significantly associated with dementia risk.“Future studies are needed to determine how much of this association is due to caregiver stress compared to a shared environment,” said study leader Dr. Maria Norton at the university.“On the positive side, the majority of individuals with spouses who develop dementia did not themselves develop dementia, therefore more research is needed to explore which factors distinguish those who are more vulnerable.”“Given the significant public health concern of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and the upcoming shift in population age composition, continued research into the causes of dementia is urgent,” Dr. Norton said.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Alzheimers-may-be-ldquoinfectiousrdquo-among-spouses-study/article16298779.ece

  | Photo Credit: Mikhail Metzel Mammoths had more than woolly coats to protect them from the frigid conditions of their sub-zero stomping grounds, scientists have discovered.The extinct beasts had a form of antifreeze blood that kept their bodies supplied with oxygen in the sub-zero temperatures, according to a study of DNA extracted from 43,000-year-old mammoth remains.A genetic adaptation in the woolly mammoths' haemoglobin - the molecular cage that carries oxygen in the blood - allowed them to thrive at high latitudes without losing much heat.Ancestors of the woolly mammoth originated in equatorial Africa about seven million years ago, but populations migrated north more than one million years ago, in a period of Earth's history when climate change caused temperatures to plummet.Unlike modern elephants, which have evolved large ears and other characteristics to keep cool in excessive heat, ancestral mammoths survived by evolving ways of saving heat, such as small ears and tails.In the latest study, a team led by Kevin Campbell at the University of Manitoba in Canada found another physiological trick that mammoths used to endure the ice age. Campbell's team isolated haemoglobin DNA from a woolly mammoth recovered from the Siberian permafrost and compared it with genetic code extracted from modern African and Asian elephants.The mammoth's DNA differed in a small but significant way. Changes in one percent of the proteins studied showed that it took less energy for mammoth haemoglobin to release its oxygen into the body as it coursed through the blood vessels. “It literally allows their blood to run cold,” Mr. Campbell said.“Without this genetic adaptation, woolly mammoths would lose more heat in winter, and they would have to replace that energy by eating more. In winter, there is less food around, so it was clearly a benefit to have this.” The research is reported in the journal Nature Genetics.Current Arctic species, such as musk ox and reindeer, have evolved a similar antifreeze system independently.Mr. Campbell said the work shows how paleobiology - broadly the study of ancient, extinct life - has come of age. “We resurrected mammoth haemoglobin. It's no different from going back 40,000 years in a time machine and taking a blood sample from the animal.”Michi Hofreiter, a co-author of the study at the University of York, said: “Our study is the first one to reconstruct an evolutionary important, adaptive trait from an extinct species using ancient DNA. It therefore opens up the possibility to build up a much more complete picture of morphology, physiology and evolutionary adaptations than would be possible using non-molecular study of fossil bones.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Mammothsrsquo-survival-trick-ndash-anti-freeze-blood/article16298778.ece
205,Scientists find way to boost nutritional levels of corn,IANS,2010-05-06,18:01:40 IST,"An ear of corn. Photo: AP

Beta-carotene is the best Vitamin A precursor, but only a very small percentage of corn varieties have naturally high beta-carotene levels.Marilyn Warburton and Edward Buckler, geneticists with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and colleagues identified genetic sequences linked to higher beta-carotene levels in corn, showing a cheaper and faster way to identify corn plants that will produce even higher levels.The researchers surveyed the genetic sequences of corn from around the world through association mapping, a method made possible by recent breakthroughs that accelerate the genetic profiling of crops.The genetic survey revealed natural variations in one gene sequence linked to higher beta-carotene levels, said an ARS release.These variations interacted with a gene identified previously, and the best variations of the two genes together led to an 18-fold increase in beta-carotene, according to Warburton.The report was recently published in Nature Genetics.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/Scientists-find-way-to-boost-nutritional-levels-of-corn/article16298786.ece

  | Photo Credit: Mail Driven by the multifaceted and intricate human emotions, Mohanmurli Talak is an abstract painter who has been arduously trying to capture the human emotion on the canvas.“Crises of human mind” has remained a pivotal subject in his paintings. The extensive use of light colours which is palpable in his works, Talak has carved a distinct niche for himself in the domain of abstract painting.Being a native of Chitradurga, the 52-year-old self-made painter has largely remained as an unsung artist for the people of his native district.Having exhibited his works in the prestigious art galleries including Y. B. Chavan Art Gallery, Mumbai, Lakshana Art Gallery, Chennai, and Chitrakala Parishat Bangalore, Talak has never undergone any formal course in visual art. It was his immense passion for painting that made him learn the intricacies of abstract painting.Talak uses simple, but varied textures to create his work. He meticulously makes efforts to ensure that his work has a soothing effect on the viewers. “Many people don't even understand the concept of abstract art, however my prime objective is to make people at least change their mood by glancing at my work,” he says.Profoundly inspired by the paintings of the classical painter Raja Ravi Varma who lived between 1848 and 1906, Talak emphatically believes that a painter can contribute towards social change.In the field of art for over 15 years, Talak says that he never had an idea that one day he would become a professional artist. Working as an accountant in a private firm in Chitradurga, he says that the biggest challenge for him was to quit his job to take up painting as a fulltime career.“It was not easy task to convince my wife of quitting a well-paid job, especially when I had an additional responsibility of a young son. Yet, I had a strong conviction for art that made me to go against all odds to prove myself,” he said.“I try to make that has an intimate feel, but also not look vulgar. You can portray nudity without being cheap,” he explains, about an entire series that he has done for one's private space.Talak, who has also created innumerable pen-drawings of historical monuments of Chitradurga, says that a painter through his works could help the place become popular among the tourists.Veerendra Heggade, the chief of Dharmasthala temple is also someone who appreciates his work. According to Talak, several of his works have made place in the Heggade's institutions.Talak feels that the painting exhibitions are gradually shifting their domain from galleries to internet. He has decided to develop his website and upload his paintings on internet for online exhibition and auctioning.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/Strokes-against-the-flow/article16298843.ece
207,Evolution of modern art,CHARUKESI,2010-05-06,17:38:15 IST,"Family on scooter: Sculpture at Cholamandal village
  Produced for the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysore, the two-part documentary ‘Modern Art in Tamilnadu' runs for about less than an hour. Yet it appears to have covered most of the vital aspects of the history of Tamil Nadu's art scene from early 1850. The documentary has been directed by Amshan Kumar, writer on films, whose book ‘Cinema Rasanai' is considered a pioneering work in film aesthetics in Tamil.The first part goes back to the genesis of modern art and covers its growth up to the 1960s. The then British rulers established the Government School of Industrial Arts in Madras in 1850 with a view to inculcating Victorian taste among art students. However, it was only in 1929 that modern art took firm roots in Tamil Nadu, when Devi Prasad Roychoudury became the Principal of the School.The statues of Mahatma Gandhi and the Triumph of Labour on Marina, sculpted by him stand testimony to Roychoudury's vision. He was mainly instrumental in inspiring a whole (young) generation interested in modern art and was responsible for establishing ‘Madras School' in the world of art.“There is an interesting story,” says Amshan Kumar. “Once when D.P. Roychoudhury was painting, the coffee he was sipping spilled on it. Students watching him thought that he would discard it. No, he ordered for more cups of coffee and poured all over the canvas and made it one of even tone. This shows his creativity!”It was then the period of K.C.S. Panicker, who took up the mantle of projecting modern art in Tamil Nadu. From water colour he switched on to oil painting. He was the one who laid great emphasis on the Indianness of our art. He founded the Cholamandal Artists' Village.Another institution that nurtured the artistic talents of students came up in Kumbakonam. The town, surrounded by mighty temples, provided ample scope to hone the artistic skills of students on the traditional lines. It was christened the Kumbakonam College of Arts & Crafts in 1962. According to Amshan Kumar, eminent artists such as S. Dhanapal, A.P. Santhana Raj, R. Krishna Rao, R.B. Bhaskaran, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and Alphonso Aruldoss served in both Chennai and Kumbakonam. Works of C.J. Anthony Doss, L. Munusamy, Krishna Rao, P.V. Janakiraman, Ramanujan and a few others are discussed.The second part covers the movement from 1970s till now. It carries the brief interviews of R.B. Bhaskaran, Alphonso Arul Doss, Achuthan Koodallur, K. Muralidharan, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and so on. Adimoolam's transition from black and white line drawings of Gandhiji to abstract oil paintings was as courageous as it was fascinating.
Figure distortion
Famed artist and art director P. Krishnamurthy's opinion that figure distortion, which arrived from the West after experimentation, was indeed introduced by the Indian artists very early on. Artists from the younger generation such as Aparajithan, Shilesh and Srinivasan also find a place with their works.While the English script for the documentary has been done by Lakshmi Venkatraman, the Tamil version has been handled by Amshan Kumar himself. A. Sarangan has wielded the camera and the voice over has been provided by Selvakumar.
Since the venue of the screening was the College premises, majority of the audience was students. Amshan Kumar answered questions posed by them.

Why the documentary chooses to be illustrative and not exhaustive in showing the artists?
“Being the first documentary that chronicles the entire history of modern art in Tamil Nadu, a limited time frame has its own charms and perils. I am not partial towards a few and biased against some of the artists. Duration of time decided the number of artists. Artists featured in this documentary are important, but those who do not are no less important. Inclusion of 50-plus major artists would have made the film like a catalogue and have done justice to none. My aim is more such films should be made and they should bring in artists who are not featured here.
Why did he make this documentary?
My aim is to demystify modern art since in the public mind it is thought of as abstruse and arcane. I think the film has achieved the objective, since many artists have explained their work in great detail and also worked in front of the camera. Viewers will feel that they are in the privacy of the studios of artists, watching as they work. I am grateful to all of them and the Central Institute of Indian Languages, as this documentary is first of its kind.Amshan Kumar has produced around twenty documentaries. They include ‘Bharathi,’ ‘U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer,’ ‘Dr. C.V. Raman,’ ‘Ashokamitran,’ ‘Badal Sircar’s Third Theatre,’ ‘Mangroves,’ ‘Tamil Theatre,’ and ‘Village Knowledge Centres’ among others. He made a feature film ‘Oruthi’ based on Ki. Rajanarayanan’s story ‘Kidai’ This was shown in Indian panorama and won an award, too. Amshan Kumar is currently working on a feature film.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/Evolution-of-modern-art/article16299906.ece
208,The salt stories,RANA SIDDIQUI ZAMAN,2010-05-06,17:08:15 IST,"V. Karthik and Sujatha Shankar Prasad
  While a few students are seen lost in their studies in the silent library room of the American Centre, it's off colour walls with a few aqua blue and mostly black and white photographs attract attention with a silence of another kind — the silence which a city-bred commoner probably didn't even care to listen to. Sometimes a picture doesn't need words to explain its content, but in the case of these photographs, words lend them a fairytale air, turning them into legends. It also draws attention to the most utilised, yet the most ignored ingredient in a household — salt.Two photographers, Chicago-based Sujatha Shankar Prasad and Chennai-based V. Karthik, chose to tell the tale of salt making from the mines at Marakkanam on the outskirts of Puducherry. Photographs detailing the process of natural salt making in the sun, as well as those of Chicago River reflecting images of the Chicago skyscrapers form this exhibition titled “Barking Tree and other places: Mythologies in the Landscape” at The American Centre.Says Karthik, “The salt mines at Puducherry play a very symbolic role for me — of free human spirit and Mahatma Gandhi. If you see these vast seascapes in summers, you will not find any human activity there. From morning to evening, salt gathers at the shores and the sun crystallises it, forming numerous, shining, uniform mounds. Landscape is hardly visible as salt forms the backwaters of the sea. Human activity happens much later when a huge mountain of salt gets naturally prepared and people from villages come to collect it. This is their only source of sustenance. And in my lab, every day I work with this water, light, shade and brightness. I could relate to the natural process.”
Interesting shots
Both Sujatha and Karthik took several interesting shots of the salt making process and the former has woven them into heart-warming tales. For instance, in a picture, an alert dog is seen sitting near a mountain of salt, almost guarding it, and a tree in the shape of a dog is called barking tree. A third picture shows a woman with a basket of salt heading homewards. Sujatha weaves them with a beautiful story that touches your heart.The prints are achieved using a traditional method no longer utilised. “Marakkanam are primarily black and white prints on fibre using traditional photographic methods from 35mm T max negative film. Tonal processes have also been explored in the colour prints for the Chicago River series, which were originally shot on Ilford XP2, a monochromatic film with a chromomeric base,” says Karthik.Says Sujatha, “In 1995 I took shots of the Chicago River on 35 mm and kept their negatives for ages. But as I wanted to take pictures out of them, they had lost quality. That's what brought me to V. Karthik in Chennai, who works in conservation and traditional photography.”The show continues till May 21.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/The-salt-stories/article16298769.ece
209,In myriad moods,K. Rajan,2010-05-06,16:13:44 IST,"Open to interpretation Rajan
  That artists should not imitate is Shilpi Rajan's motto. Therefore following a set of prescribed rules is, naturally, quite unthinkable for the renowned artist.“I never repeat my works,” quipped Rajan as he pointed out his sculptures, which were on display at the Kerala Lalitakala Akademi in Thrissur from April 28 to May 4. And true to his word, each of the 64 sculptures on show at the exhibition titled ‘Kalkkathal,' was unique. This was Rajan's 11th solo exhibition since he started sculpting back in 1984.
Self-taught artiste
The self-taught sculptor revels at depicting varying moods in the same sculpture. “Perhaps it is because I do not complete a sculpture at a stretch.“Although gloom would appear to be the dominant mood,the sculptures actually reflect my mood at that particular point of time when I worked on them,” explained Rajan.“As in life, a sculpture too cannot bear a permanent mood,” he added.What strikes one the most is the influence of folk culture in the sculptures. His human figurines bear clear traces of folk and tribal deities found in the State.Perhaps it is because the artist cannot escape the social milieu in which he grew up. As such, Rajan leaves behind a touch of his identity and originality even in his commissioned works.A wooden sculpture depicting Parvati and Ganapati and one of Koodiyattam maestro Chahchu Chakyar in granite are examples.Of the sculptures that were exhibited, 13 were in granite and four in laterite. None of them has been given a name. “The meaning of a sculpture cannot be contained in a name. It is for the viewer to interpret the meanings for themselves,” said the artist. There is one work though that is special to him, he said.It is a long wooden piece that depicts elephants huddled together, each standing on another and with a woman at the top. The message conveyed is that elephants are so gentle that they can be managed even by one woman.“It also signifies the inter-relationship between animals and nature,” he said.An eye that is not shaped well or a lip that is not in place does not seem to faze the artist and he appears not to be unduly worried about sticking to the norms of sculpting. Studying the sculptures of others, he said, was not of any value to him.“I feel that sculpture should not be taught. Rather, it should be developed in the course of one's own practice of the art,” said Rajan.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/In-myriad-moods/article16298757.ece

  | Photo Credit: Ajit Solanki India figures among the world’s worst 10 countries causing environmental damage, according to a new study which lists Brazil as the most polluting country.The research led by professor Corey Bradshaw, of the University of Adelaide's environment institute, has placed India at seventh position while ranking the U.S. and China as the largest carbon producers after Brazil.The 10 countries with the worst global footprint were Brazil, the US, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru, it said.Countries were measured on a range of indicators, including fertiliser use, natural forest loss, habitat conservation, fisheries and other marine captures, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat.The study, published in the science journal PLoS ONE Wednesday, found Australia's carbon emissions, rate of species threat and natural forest loss were the greatest contributors to its ninth-place ranking, according to The Age.“If you're clearing a lot of forests, you tend to also to overharvest in the ocean and use a lot of fertilisers,” Mr. Bradshaw said explaining the link between development and environmental damage.Mr. Bradshaw said finding the US and China in the top 10 were not surprising, though he was surprised that a relatively poor country such as Brazil took out the top spot.“The wealthier you are, the more damage you do, on average,” he said. “It's just a function of human nature. Growth is the be-all and end-all for all economies around the world, and if you're not growing economically, you're stagnant, and therefore that's a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that's unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Mr. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Mr. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Mr. Bradshaw said the better-ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven't wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we'd consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/India-among-the-worst-10-polluters-Study/article16298793.ece

  | Photo Credit: K_Murali Kumar Dance festival Nitya Nritya commenced with Lalitha Srinivasan's “Nritya Karnataka”, the opulence of which is marked with its supreme musical score sung by Srivatsa, with the dance choreography accomplished brilliantly by students of Nupura School of Dance.Commencing the evening with “astanayika” with verse in Kannada, set to ragamalika and talamalika, the group proved their forte implementing the composition set by their Guru intensely.Segregating the astanayikas equally amongst well-groomed dancers, while a single dancer enacted the sanchari with the rest freezing at a particular posture concomitant to the sthayi bhava of the nayika implementation, the choreographer, brilliantly composed each Nayika giving a ingenious touch. With awesome prototypes governing the proscenium, the dancers moved onto a Manasi Varnam penned and choreographed by Lalitha Srinivasan pivoting around the pranks of Lord Krishna, the Geetopodesham episode with a musical composition by the late H.K. Narayana.Ajay Vishwanath, one of the seniormost students executed his metaphor brilliantly in the said piece. “Nritya Karnataka” concluded with a ragamalika tillana set to aditala aesthetically performed by the dancers executing square, circle to form the Sri Chakra concept.The Sufiana Kathak under the leadership of Rani Khanam from New Delhi followed next. With the dancer seemingly self-conscious, she tried hard to do justice to the items that she performed. The tihayis, the anahat and the concluding “Mohae apnae rang de rangilae” composed by Hazrat Amir Khusru in the 13th Century deserves special mention for their accomplishment in high aesthetic order. Bharat Natyam thematic duet by P. Praveen Kumar and Soundarya Srivatsa was brilliant. With the kritis, the javalis and the ashtapadis being intertwined into a thematic production “Shringara Lahiri” set to ragamalika and talamalika sung aesthetically by Srivatsa was a real treat to watch. Both the dancers proved their mettle in this evocative rendition.The plot complimented with Soundarya being mesmerised with the flute of Lord Krishna and Praveen in the limelight executing the advent of the Lord with an awesome amalgamation of jathis; it was executed flawlessly. With a peacock's feather as an imagery, Praveen with Soundarya as Radha complimented each other brilliantly on the stage. The “Radhae Brindavana Nilayae” set to raga Rithigowla was an outstanding performance. Abhinaya reaches an echelon of superlative when executed most naturally. Praveen and Soundarya's most natural, yet traditional abhinaya won the audience. In “Yahi madhava yahi Keshava” Krishna eventually manages to placate Radha. He even fulfils her desire to wear his kinkini. It becomes a grand metaphor with the mingling of the micro and macro.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/Intensely-involved/article16298844.ece
212,High degree of sophistication,VIDYA SARANYAN,2010-05-06,17:24:47 IST,"Meenakshi Srinivasan. Photo: M. Karunakaran
  | Photo Credit: M_Karunakaran The Kapaleeswarar temple has a unique aura that makes for an immediacy of the reach of the arts. And it was here that the Saraswati Educational Cultural and Charitable Trust had organised the Vasanta Utsav festival.On the inaugural day, the motley crowd could hardly miss the burning zeal and the high degree of sophistication of Meenakshi Srinivasan's Bharatanatyam. A disciple of Guru Venkatachalapathi and subsequently Alarmel Valli, Meenakshi has established a reputation for sincerity and expertise with her performances around the world.The programme planning and performance seemed to target the temple audience and factored in the absence of trappings such as the stage and curtain. Her recital that day revolved largely round Lord Siva and His consort. Abhinaya and nritta were given a balanced treatment. What stood out in Meenakshi's performance was the ability to create, communicate and sustain a particular mood without a single wrinkle.Thus the opening number ‘Ananda Natana Prakasham' in Kedaram could draw in the bliss as well as the contemplative nature of the Lord. The next number, a varnam, spotlighted the sringara aspect without losing sight of the divine nature of the beloved. Dhandayudhapani Pillai's ragamalika ‘Samiyai Azhaithodi Vaa' was interpreted as a dialogue where the sakhi's lack of comprehension of Siva's magnificence paved the way for the nayika to enlighten her. The choreography showed attention to detail: for instance, the Ardhanareeswara was depicted by contrasting the fiery locks of Siva with the long braid of the goddess.
Superb stamina
It was obvious that showmanship was a leading criterion here: following what seems to be today' s trend, the adavus for the theermanams were structured so that the artist was always hurtling around the performing space. One hardly got to witness a whole adavu; instead the long, complex patterns with different nadais were offered as incessant combos of different kinetic adavus. While one was full of admiration for the superb stamina and dedication of the artist (given that this is summer), one also wished some moments of calm had been built in.The abhinaya was a different story and there were numerous moments where one got to relish the artistic imagination. In ‘Jaya Jaya Durge', the goddess was revered not just as the vanquisher of demons but also of the evils within us. The contrasting images of raudram and vatsalyam were delivered with panache. Similarly, Meenakshi's involvement in abhinaya gave a lift to the Tamil piece ‘Dikku thereiyada kaatil.'It was in the thillana that the artist revealed her true mettle as the araimandi remained undiluted, the body lines stayed unfrayed as sollu alternated with the lines of the thillana as shudda nritta. The superb orchestral team of vocalist Hariprasad, Jaisri Ramanathan's nattuvangam, Kalaiarasan's violin and Vedakrishnan's mridangam galvanised Meenakshi's dancing to greater heights.The Kapaleeswarar temple resounded with dha dhindhinda… syllables not often heard in the Chennai air. As devotees turned the corner to the mandapam in the temple, the reason became clear. Kaveri Sageder and Sheetal Kolwalkar, disciples of Shama Bhate from Pune, were presenting a Kathak performance for the Vasant Utsav.For their performance, they used recorded music of high quality. The music ranged from the classical to semi-classical, and, in their words, 'world music'. Rather than stick to lengthy delineations of taal and its nuances, the duo chose short pieces with more of abhinaya content. Perhaps this was to ensure that the Chennai citizen got to comprehend Kathak better.
Dynamic rhythm
It was the dynamic rhythm presentation of teen tal that stole the show. The pieces revealed the dancers' competency in footwork and their control. The introductory number ‘Om Nama Shivaya' followed with the elaboration of teen taal was gripping and impressed the audience with some crystal clear footwork. The five inch wide ghunghroos, the slapping sound of the feet on the granite floor and the whirling skirts of Kaveri and Sheetal projected some weighty fare.Here, the two dancers presented the ginti, taatakar and taat which helped display their skill and experience. If one came looking forward to some challenging sawal jawab sessions, one left disappointed. For the rest of the programme turned out to be a collection of songs which although pleasing to the eyes, fell short on substance. While they offered some lively dancing, the really weighty points of the Kathak style were left unexplored.The abhinaya pieces came in quick succession and set a spirited tone. Maestro Bhimsen Joshi's bhajan ‘Krupa sarovar' extolled the compassion of Krishna and the Ganesha stuti rendered by Shankar Mahadevan reflected the creative bent of Lord Siva. But the Mahadev Sutaha became a piece more memorable for the noisy musical effects than the energetic dancing by the duo. The classicism of such features such as the wrist movements and the stylised walk were overshadowed by the light content of the music; sweet to see but powdery as snow. Even if the dancing per se remained undiluted, the end product varied depending on whether the music was classical or not.The tandav stood out for restrained delivery of Siva's synergy. This piece helped the recital stay on an even keel; the destructive and the creative aspects were powerfully projected through mime and pure rhythm. The finale ‘Vande Mataram' was well performed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/High-degree-of-sophistication/article16299937.ece

  Celebrations across the week for World Dance Day (April 29) saw Bharatanatyam star Chitra Visweswaran in a lecture/demonstration concentrate on the communicative strength of classical dance, the evocative snippets by her disciple Vijay Madhavan and Chitra highlighting aspects of rhythm, gesture and word, and how detailing in dance conveys the message to the viewer — thematic concerns like animals, natural beauty, writing, etc., not straying from the world of the young into esoteric poetry.Spic Macay's evening projection at JNU had the legendary Birju Maharaj weave his Kathak spell, the evening tracing, in Maharaj's inimitable way, how rhythm, implicit in every activity of creation, acquires a visual dimension through movement images and vocabulary of rhythm in dance. The earlier half of the evening featured an enthralling Kuchipudi duet by Raja and Radha Reddy, Raja's tandav brilliance in “Adenamma” in Paras portraying Shiva's dance counter-pointed by the lasya lyricism in “Sringara Lahari” in Neelambari, describing the gracious beauty of the Devi. singing by Sai Bhavani sustained the performance despite the absence of Kaushalya Reddy's authoritative nattuvangam. The disciples with daughter Bhavana participating, impressed in nritta exploration. For a welcome change, tarangam was performed to the Natabhairavi composition of Ravi Shankar.
Dance and value
Natya Vriksha's annual observance of the occasion at the IIC saw a vigorous seminar on classical dance and its values to society at large. Asking how one values value, keynote speaker, renowned dancer/choreographer Kumudini Lakhia, spoke of creating values in classical dances which come with inbuilt structure of values. Individual creativity demanded new interpretations, keeping respect for ethics of the form and its aesthetics sacrosanct — intellectual engagement with different sections of society becoming inevitable for dancers today, asking themselves “Why do I dance?” Quoting several philosophers from Kant to Freud, academic Krishna Menon, Associate Professor, LSR College, questioned the importance of art in an unequal society as an assertion of cultural sovereignty and political importance. As soft power appealing to other states, art, unless involved with people, cannot claim strong ownership or association.But can dance with the body (a most wonderful and also most vulnerable instrument) as medium be compared with other art forms while making assessments? With Indian dance history written on the woman's body, society, given all the renaissance, does not place the art form on the highest pedestal, a point emphasised through practical references from a lifelong career in Odissi, by Aruna Mohanty.Calling dance a Yoga which can open windows otherwise permanently shut in human beings, enabling a reinvention and renovation to upgrade skills which have formed traditional wealth of legacies, art commentator and Chairperson of APPAN Shanta Serbjeet Singh pleaded for respecting the likes of our Langas and Manganiyars and adding value to their creativity. Principal, Gargi College, Meera Ramachandran spoke of dance as the amalgam of all arts. Lata Vaidyanathan referred to the challenges of teaching “learning to learn', classical dance adding to the value of different types of intelligences, amidst Bollywood and all other popular culture. Malabika Mitra extolled Creator and the Created, being the same as in Nataraja.
The performances
That the best value is what comes as an irrepressible urge from the dancer's innermost being was shown by Pravat Kumar Swain, who, with his grace with assertive strength, angika exactitude, total immersion of being in the dance, was the find of the evening Young Dancers' Festival. Riveting Odissi by this 23-year-old covered mangalacharan on the Panchabhoota, Varshamisaran portraying the ecstatic response to first rains, and the delightful rhythms built round Konarak Kanthi — with the Thai Nata “Ta hamta hat tat ta” mnemonics of Debaprasad Das' creation woven into the choreography (making the audience sway) — and finally the natya-filled Ramayana passages of Hanuman in Ashokavan meeting Sita to present the choodamani. Wings led by Aruna Mohanty were competently manned with Vijay Kumar Brik (mardala) and Roopak Kumar Parida (vocal) and excellent violin and flute. This Gotipua trained youngster, for several years under Aruna, is a natural, and heralds a new era re-discovering the male body in Odissi.Shloka Vaidyalingam trained by the Reddys, gave a competent Kuchipudi presentation foot-sure in rhythm with fair abhinaya understanding, highlighted through the Ganapati invocation in Gaula, Tiruvottiyur Tyagiah varnam in Kedaram “Saami Nee Rammanave” with sringar interspersed with the rhythmic virtuosity of jatis led by Kaushalya's nattuvangam, and tarangam in Arabhi.Sneha Chakradhar's assertive Bharatanatyam with excellent rhythmic understanding (evident right from the alarippu in Tisram with mnemonics differently arranged from the conventional) and the Poorvikalyani Dandayudapani varnam “Saamiyai vara solladi”, was creditable for proven familiarity with the text from one not born to the languages of South India, barring words like “Bhoomi-pugazhum, and Kallatanam” which needed more elaboration.But while Nadanamadinar in Vasanta visualising the magnificence of the dancing Nataraja was fine in tone, the varnam, in the nayika's persuasion of the sakhi to carry her message of love to Kartikeya, would have shone more with some soft and more lyrical touches, contrasting the power. Geeta Chandran's nattuvangam added a special high point to the competent musical effort.Disciple of Malabika Mitra, Saurav Roy is a trained dancer. But too much speed in the Teen tal drut passages made flailing of hands sans aesthetics and sharp focus in movement.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/Value-creation-in-Indian-dance/article16298772.ece
214,Absolute abhinaya,Nisha M.,2010-05-06,16:09:42 IST,"Art of expression: Keerthi Panicker
  A Bharatanatyam recital by Keerthi Panicker caught the attention of rasikas at Vyloppilly Samskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram, for the youthful exuberance of the artiste. This up-and-coming artiste is a senior disciple of the Dhananjayans of Barathakalanjali, Chennai. All the items in her recital were choreographed by her gurus themselves.Keerthi began with a Ganapathi stuthi, a composition by Karaikudi R. Krishnamurthy. She moved on to another beautiful piece in praise of Lord Nataraja in raga Lathangi, set to Adi tala. Keerthi maintained an elegant approach in her presentation of this joyful dance, which according to myth, the Lord in Chidambaram performed at the request of the saints.Keerthi then took up ‘Nritypahaaram' varnam ‘Bhaavayami Reghuraama' by Semmangudi Sreenivasa Iyer. The piece, a summary of the Ramayana, was perfect in Keerthi's hands. Her movements and striking turnings had a scintillating flow and the whole story was conveyed with élan.Following this Keerthi essayed two challenging presentations portraying two totally different emotions of nayikas. ‘Netranthi neerathile,' is a padam in raga Lathangi that portrays the nayika's fury towards Lord Murugan, whom she sees at the river bank in the company of other women. Keerthi depicted the ‘khandita' nayika in this piece, which ends with the efforts of the nayika trying to convince her beloved to come back to her.The next piece in ragamalika is about a nayika (Radha) who is despondent over the ‘viraha' (separation) from Lord Krishna, and the nayika's conversation with her sakhi. Radha tries to draw a picture of Lord Krishna only to find that she cannot recollect his face.
Excellent depiction
These two absolute abhinaya pieces demand a lot of facial expressions and Keerthi has skilfully transported the theme to the highest level thanks to her excellent training. Her control over abhinaya in the two padams was absolute.Keerthi concluded her recital with a tillana in raga Behag. Also included in the programme was a thematic representation of a prayer to Lord Guruvayurappan by artistes from Bharathakalanjali.Keerthi was accompanied by Santha Dhananjayan on the nattuvangam. Buvaneswari Madhusudanan (vocal), T.N. Satheesh Kumar (mridangam), Jayaprakash (violin) and Prasanth Shenayi (flute) also accompanied.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/Absolute-abhinaya/article16299935.ece

Kuchipudi maestro Vempati China Satyam was honoured with the State government's Natyacharya Award comprising a citation, shawl and Rs.50,000 in cash by the Tribal Welfare Minister P. Balaraju. His disciples offered Swarna Pooja to their illustrious guru, who has made the tradition find a prominent place in the international arena of classical dance.More prominent was the day-long celebration organised by members of the Nataraj Music and Dance Academy, founded and provided with a Kuchipudi teaching and training institute by Vikram Goud Bathina. It was launched with a two-hour workshop conducted by noted exponent Manju Bhargavi of Sankarabharanam fame. After this, tens of dozens of dancers in glittering costume representing fifteen forms of folk dance traditions gathered in the afternoon at R.K. Beach. They were all brought in procession to Gurajada Kalakshetram at which the main function was held in the evening.After a solo (Kuchipudi) performed by Sai Jyothi, leaders of folk forms of dances – Chekka bhajana, Tappetagullu, Kolatam, Dappu nrityam, Garaga nrityam, Burrakadha, Jalari nrityam, Veeranatyam, Jamukula Kadha and Chitikela kolatam – were honoured with mementos and cash awards. The chief guest for the evening, P. Balaraju, honoured Manju Bhargavi and conferred the title of Navarasa Natyakalamanjari on her.Next, a Kuchipudi dance ballet Sri Lalitha Nrityarchanam was presented by her disciples Veena, Dhanya, Kirthi, Hari, Vasanth, Madhav and others with herself in the lead. It was a translated version of Sri Lalithaashtottara Satha Nama Stuti in Sanskrit into Telugu by Rallabandi Kavitha Prasad. The ballet was set to evocative music by D.S. Sastry in nine ragas – Aarabhi, Kamavardhini, Hindolam, Sahana, Punnagavarali, Mohana, Kanada, Ranjani and Suddhasaveri – and the choreography by Manju Bhargavi was excellent.

He is a goal scorer. So he is our Wayne Rooney, I guess,” Horner said, comparing Vettel with the Manchester United and England striker Rooney.“I think Sebastian is the driver to beat in the championship at the moment. He is the driver in the best form with arguably the fastest car.”Asked to what characterises Vettel as a forthcoming champion, Horner said: “Number One is speed. Number two is intelligence and number three his personality. These are three major attributes that he has.“He is very straightforward. He is a very pleasant guy to deal with. He is a very intelligent driver. He knows what he wants from the car. He has a very good feeling for the car combined with a lot of natural talent. He is obviously very hungry and he is a big motivation within the team.”Vettel, 22, was runner-up to Jenson Button in 2009 championship and currently lies fifth in the championship with 45 points from four races, 15 behind the leader Button. The German won the Singapore GP but was stopped in leading position it the opening races in Bahrain and Australia by technical problems.“We have a very good car. In the first two races, Sebastian was in the position to win. If there were not the issues on Sebastians car he would have won the first two races,” said Horner.Horner named the championship “very, very open with three different winners in the first for races” and said that his team has all but ideal combination of drivers with the youngster Vettel and the experienced Australian Webber, who lies eighth with 28 points.“I think that we do have a very good balance in the team. We have got two guys in very different stages of their career. We have got a young, very hungry driver and a driver who is much more experienced.“It is a very healthy balance. They have a very professional relationship and I am very happy with the pairing we have,” said Horner.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/lsquoVettel-is-Red-Bullrsquos-Wayne-Rooneyrsquo/article16298746.ece

  Formula One fans seem to have lost interest in Michael Schumacher and favour Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher’s former manager said in an interview published on Thursday.However, the ex-manager Willi Weber also warned against writing off record world champion Schumacher, who is struggling in his comeback season from a three-year hiatus.Replaced by former spokeswoman Sabine Kehm as manager, Weber is still responsible for Schumacher’s merchandising and told Bild daily that sales are from those of the past.“Sales are not how I expected them to be. There is a certain Schumi-tiredness. The people are saying: my god, where is he driving? You only know him as a winner,” Weber told Bild.“In the past the tribunes were full of Ferrari caps. Now I can count the silver caps with one hand.” Schumacher won five of his world titles with Ferrari and came out of retirement for Mercedes GP this season on a three-year contract.The 41-year-old has had a modest season so far with just 10 points from four races.Weber said that the Red Bull driver Vettel has filled the void as German top driver.“Wherever I look, Vettel is the new Schumi, he is the number one in the TV ads and on the billboards. Michael has left a void and Sebastian has grown into it, because he has the success and Michael doesn’t have it yet,” Weber said.Weber expects an undisputed victory from Vettel at the next race on Sunday in Spain but is also convinced that Schumacher will rebound in the end and win again, even if it takes until next year.“I suffer with Michael when I see how he was passed down the ranks in China. But he will work until everything fits. If all goes well he will get a race win this season. But don’t write Michael off.

220,Picture of neglect,Suganthy Krishnamachari,2010-05-06,18:13:36 IST,"The Pazhuvettaraiyar temple gopuram in a bad state of repair.
  The Big Temple inspires one with a sense of awe, at its scale, grandeur and magnificence. But if you are looking for understated elegance, head for the Twin temples (Irattai Koil) of Kizhaiyur. These are two early Chola temples of stone, miniscule in comparison with the Big Temple, but enchanting, nevertheless. From inscriptions we learn that the temple complex was called Avani Kandarpa Iswara Griham. It was built by a Pazhuvettaraiyar chief, who was a contemporary of Aditya Chola I, and who bore the titles of Avani Gandharvan, Gangamarthandan, Kaliyuganirmoolan, Maravan Maladhalan and Araiyagal Araivuli. The Dwajasthambam was built by yet another Pazhuvettaraiyar- Ranamukharaman.According to S.R. Balasubrahmanyam, the earliest inscription in the temple complex, is of the 13th regnal year of Aditya Chola. But there are those who believe that this inscription is of a later period. This inscription records a gift for burning a perpetual lamp in the two shrines, under the orders of Nakkan Pazhuvettaraiyan Kumaran Kandan. Many other Pazhuvettaraiyars are mentioned in inscriptions in the two temples, and are also referred to as Maravar, Vadugar and Kaikkolar.(For admirers of writer Kalki, the name Pazhuvettaraiyar would have a special connotation. ‘Ponniyin Selvan' bristles with intrigue and vengeance, the Pazhuvettaraiyar Brothers behind all the trechery.)Inscriptions in the villages of Kizhapazhuvur and Melapazhuvur, which are just a few miles from Kizhaiyur, also talk of the Pazhuvettaraiyars. An inscription of the 12th regnal year of Parantaka I, seen in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple in Kizhappazhuvur, talks of the victory won by Pazhuvettaraiyar Kandan Amudanar, over the Pandyas, and their Ceylonese ally, at the battle of Vellin, in which the Pandya king lost his life. To commemorate this victory, the commander Nakkan Sathan made a gift for a perpetual lamp in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple.But who were the Pazhuvettaraiyars? Their origin seems somewhat of a mystery. The Anbil plates of Sundara Chola mention one of Parantaka I's queens as the daughter of “the Kerala King, who was called Pazhuvettaraiyar.” So were the Pazhuvettaraiyars from the Chera kingdom?The deity in the Kizhapazhuvur temple, has been sung of by Gnanasambandar, in the second Thirumurai, 34th padhigam. Verses four and eleven explicitly state that Malayali Brahmins were the priests in the Vadamulanatha (Alandurai Mahadeva) temple. Thevaram scholar Dr. R. Narayanan says, “In the Dharmapuram adheenam publication, the word ‘maraiyaalar' in verse five, meaning Vedic scholars, is also interpreted as ‘Malayali Brahmins.'” Thus although there was a Malayali presence in the Pazhuvur region, there is no conclusive proof that the Pazhuvettaraiyars were of Chera origin.The twin temples of Kizhaiyur, however, have not been sung of in the Thevaram. The Southern shrine in the Kizhaiyur temple complex is referred to in inscriptions as Thenvayil Sri Koil. An inscription of the time of Rajendra Chola says that two persons guilty of homicide had to surrender their land to the Kizhaiyur temple. Another inscription also of Rajendra I's time shows that provision was made for paying a ‘nattuvakkani'- dance master.The twin temples are West facing, and Umapathy sthapati says that it can be inferred from this that the temples were built for a special purpose. If there was a threat from an enemy, or if there were internecine quarrels in a community, or if there had been a famine, then a West facing temple would be built. This is true of both Vaishnava and Siva temples.Another early Chola temple complex is the one at Moovar Koil, but the difference is that in Moovar Koil, both the temples have the same type of sikhara. But in Kizhaiyur, the Southern shrine has a square sikhara, while the smaller northern shrine of Choleeswaram (now called Arunchaleswaram), has a round sikhara.Umapathy explains that whether it is a Siva temple, or a Vishnu temple, the sikhara and pattern of the temple will depend on the type of idol to be installed. If it is a Vishnu temple, then construction will be according to whether the idol is to be sayana, asana,or sthanaka. If it is a representation of a vibhava avatara like Trivikrama, then the rules of iconometry will be different, and the temple pattern will also be different.In the case of a Siva temple, one could have Nagara (square), Dravida (octagonal) or Vesara (circular) sikhara depending upon the Linga chosen. Usually, the sikhara will have to be in the same category as the Linga. Thus if a Nagara linga is decided upon, then the sikhara will also be Nagara.The idol of the Nandi facing the garba griha in the Southern shrine, looks reposeful. The folds of the skin at the neck make it look so lifelike, that one is almost tempted to touch it to make sure it is indeed a stone sculpture and not a real bull!
Brimming with energy
In the mukhamantapa, we find lion pillars. The lions seem to brim with energy, ready to spring on you. In the Vedas, the lion represents energy and the elephant beauty, explains Veezhinathan sthapati. Only animals and birds mentioned in the Vedas such as peacocks, swans, elephants etc. would find a place in temples, he says.Outside the sanctum sanctorum are four pillars, the tops of which can be made to rotate, according to a villager. He rues the fact that while until a few years ago, the tops of all four would rotate, now only one does. It was common for sculptors to display their skills by sculpting such pillars or by making a sphere in a yazhi's mouth rotate.In the mukhamantapa, is a beautiful sculpture of Siva and Parvati, which, unfortunately, is covered with oil, soot and grime. How can devotees be allowed to light lamps so close to the sculptures? There is yet another Nandi in a corner of the mukhamantapa. It is not clear where this came from.The northern shrine is also a two-tiered one, like the southern shrine. An inscription here shows that one of Raja Raja I's queens belonged to the Pazhuvettaraiyar clan. The inscription, of the 27th regnal year of Raja Raja, says that upon the request of his queen Nakkan Panchavan Mahadevi, the daughter of Avani Kandarpa Purattu Devanar of Pazhuvur, the king granted income from newly surveyed lands to the temple. The outer walls of both shrines have sculptures of Dakshinamurthy, Subrahmanya, and Brahma. Devotees have fixed huge bindis of vermilion and sandal on these sculptures.The vermilion powder might contain corrosive substances, which could damage the sculptures. But who is to make sure that devotees don't deface sculptures, in a temple that is unattended? Should a monument of this kind not have a guard?The brick and mortar gopuram of the complex is in a bad state, with plants growing on it. The yard is ill lit, and presents an unswept look, with bushes here and there. A board put up by the State Archaeology department lies uncared for on the ground. There is a ‘volunteer' priest, who doesn't seem to know much about conservation. It is a sad commentary on the regard we have for our treasures, when even a protected monument is in such a state of neglect.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/Picture-of-neglect/article16298790.ece

  | Photo Credit: V_Ganesan Just as Helen Keller said in many of her writings, India's visually impaired and much acclaimed violinist M. Chandrasekaran also feels: “It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision…” He adds: “My mother imparted a rich visualisation of the world, and got me inclined to the melodic world. When I look back, I feel even with eyesight, I wouldn't have achieved so much…”Chandrasekaran, rewinding to his initial days of hard work and resolve, brought in an overpowering sense of musicality to the conversation and enriched it with spontaneous serenades, explanations and demonstrations. “You have to get a face-to-face feel of my musical personality, only then can you write,” his modest expressions went on unrestrained.Struck by a severe form of jaundice even before he had turned two, his mother Charubala Mohan, a violinist, was forced to take a decision to get his eyes removed to avoid further damage. “My mother showed the nerve and fortitude to go ahead. “That was just the beginning of her determination… before long she learnt Braille and put me on a daily routine of Braille-and-violin-classes everyday,” recalls the violinist who lost his father when he was seven.Born in Kolkata, Chandrasekaran spent his early years in Kanpur, and has lived in Tamil Nadu (Tiruvaiyaru and later Chennai) for the last 65 years. “My mother says I could recognise ragas even as a three-year-old and was constantly humming, which provided a background to her mundane, household chores. It was difficult for me to hold the violin on my leg and use the bow. My mother moved heaven-and-earth for hours together everyday to see me balance the instrument and get the bowing mechanism right, ” recalls Chandrasekaran.Vocal lessons, as a rule, preceded his violin classes. Only after he mastered the sangatis and got the bhava right could he try it on the violin, he says. “You have to sing on the violin,” my mother insisted “and years later I realised that it had helped me bring clarity in my expressions.” Vocal music too became a significant constituent of his presentations and as a 11-year-old, he had already stepped on to the stage. In 1950, he received the Best Violinist Award (as a 13-year-old) from the Music Academy in Chennai. He continued his vocal lessons under Mannargudi Sambasiva Bhagavatar and Kumbakonam Vishwanatha Iyer. Later, he was trained in padam rendering by Vidyala Narasimha Naidu and even today he renders padam and javalis along with his daughter for Bharatanatya recitals, the recent ones being their Cleveland Festival performances.“It was during my growing up years that my mother often took me to the sacred festivities in temples and that's where my senses opened up to the sublime “Yadukula Kambodhi” and Gambheeranatte raga on nadaswara.” Chandrasekaran's Todi on the National Programme of AIR came in for appreciation by nadaswara vidwans of the late 1950s and the manner in which he essayed Kadanakuthoohala had Rajaratnam Pillai comment: “This hand is going to play lakhs of krithis.” Consciously, he was taken to the nadaswara style and the unique chemistry of the wind-instrument was also evident in his playing. The amalgam was palpable vidwans T.Chowdiah, Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu would often notice this.Chandrasekharan has accompanied an entire gamut of stalwarts from old-timers Ariyakudi, Maharajapuram Vishwanatha Iyer, GNB, Madurai Mani, flute Mahalingam to Dr. Balamurali Krishna, N. Ramani and the reigning stars of today. His solo performances termed ‘voco-violin' (with vocal renderings) have come in for appreciation although the master thinks, “accompanying has its challenges,” as he is known for his ‘deep shadow-follow' of the main artistes which requires a different mindset. And this painstaking focus has helped him deal with absolutely teasing pallavis, as also the age-old avadhana-pallavi set to more than one tala and simultaneously at that.Titles and honours run into several paragraphs for Chandrasekaran that include the Sangeetha Kalanidhi and the Sangeeth Natak Academy award and his profound gratitude to his mother has him running the ‘Charubala Mohan Trust' that honours music vidwans and conducts music programmes.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/The-song-paved-the-way/article16298846.ece

Manjunath (mridanga) in Bangalore.The performance, devoted entirely to the compositions of Muthuswami Dikshithar, included krithis in some rare ragas, the arohana, avarohana, and salient features of which were demonstrated lucidly, and handled with admirable felicity and finesse by the young vocalist. The opening number, “Kanakambari Karunyamrithalahari” in Kanakambari raga and tishra ekatala, was adorned with brief kalpana swaras highlighting the vivadi characteristics and jaru glides of the nishada and gandhara.“Mangalambayai Namasthe” in Malavasri raga and jhampa thala, beginning with the swarakshara ‘ma' in the tara sthayi was instantly arresting, and was followed by the beautiful krithi “Kumaraswaminam” in Asaveri.Sumadyuthi, generally equated with Simhendramadhyamam, was taken up for a short alapana that threw its unique identity and distinct ‘pa dha sa' usage into sharp focus. “Pamarajanapalini” was rendered with a few avartanas of kalpana swaras. The main raga of the evening, Shankarabharanam, was elaborated in a series of soft, mellifluous sancharas that combined spontaneity with technical virtuosity. “Akshayalinga Vibho” in mishra chapu thala featured an excellent neraval and kalpana swaras suffused with raga bhava at “Badarivana”, and was succeeded by a tani avarthana. The concluding item was “Sri Kamalambike Sive Pahimam” in Sri raga.The mellow majesty of the compositions and the uniformly sedate tempo maintained throughout, generated an effect that was different from that of the usual concert format in vogue. The accompanying artistes sustained and accentuated the underlying tenor of the recital with expert and appropriate responses. According to vocalist G. Ravi Kiran, the driving force behind Guruguhaamrta, the aim is “to preserve and propagate the singing of Dikshithar's compositions” through a series of concerts and lecture demonstrations, the material for which is sourced primarily from the “Sangeetha Sampradaya Pradarshini” of Subbarama Dikshithar.Along with clarifications about the musical form, explanations of the lyrics and their spiritual significance, and of literary embellishments such as rhyme, alliteration and assonance, and deployment of yathis and madhyamakala sahitya, which are integral components of the compositions, will definitely lead discerning listeners to higher levels of enjoyment and edification.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Rare-gems/article16298845.ece

  Kasturi Rangan's forceful and deep voice with waves of rolling akara conferred classical weight on his exposition in Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samiti's Bahula Panchami concert. Raga alapanas provided solid experience occasionally with excess vocalisation. Sancharas, deeply reflective, focussed on highlighting the radiance of the ragas, Sankarabharanam and earlier Pantuvarali.He freely let his voice unfold his manodharma and formulated its progress in vidwat idiom. With spells of inspiration, his talent combined smoothness of music's flow with the chaste characteristics of classicism. This lofty approach and relevant technique indicated the lines of his grooming.Melodic majesty was his prized performing base. This could be sensed in the many variations in negotiating the tara sthayi segment. This to a great extent explained the pulsating pleasantness.
Impressive and creative
Sankarabharanam (‘Yaduta Nilachite') provided the core of the recital. Kasturi Rangan's creativity couched in elegant twists and turns counted for its impressiveness. Vocal immensity exerted its influence on providing Sankarabharanam's panoramic edifice. A major part of development explored many levels of the raga's reach. The phrasings documented the moorchana boundaries and the akara-packed raga complex was gradually presented.The interpretative method well communicated the loveliness of the kirtana. The flow of the sangatis was set against the grandeur of the piece. It hit the right aesthetic areas, a method imbibed from his guru Seshagopalan's style. It would do him much good to convert imitation to emulation and observe restraint for artistic effect. The first taste of the concert at the start, the Aarabhi Pancharatnam ‘Saadinchane' whetted the appetite for the rest of the songs — ‘Sangita Gnanamu' (Dhanyasi), ‘Evarikai' (Devamanohari) and ‘Dunmarga' (Ranjani). The rendering of the kirtanas in general drew strength from exuberance packed in them.While overall the singing represented Carnatic flavour, Kasturi Rangan's Pantuvarali alapana was in the ustad mode. The kirtana was ‘Appa Rama Bhakti.' It was not a single factor that ensured the brilliance of the programme. Voice, talent, guru's influence and steadfastness combined to project Carnatic solidarity.As against the thrustful approach of the vocalist, V.V. Srinivasa Rao, on the violin, softly textured the ragas Sankarabharanam and Pantuvarali in his solo sessions. His play incorporated gentle touches to the sancharas and the economy in building Sankarabharanam was noteworthy, stressing the essence concerted more than elaboration. It was a very respectable face of Sankarabharanam that he delineated.Mannarkoil Balaji's mridangam revealed a style of play wedded to laya substance. There was, good balance between expertise and efficiency, in his thani.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Chaste-rendition/article16299693.ece

Kanjhangad Sankaran Namboothiri's concert was mellifluous. The Carnatic vocalist was accompanied by Subbaraman (violin) and Mahesh Kumar (mridangam).He wooed the audience with the Adi tala varnam piece ‘Neranammithi' in Kannada. His rendition of an alapana of Lalitha was scholarly. Then came Subhapanthuvarali and the Tyagaraja kriti ‘Ennaalluage.' ‘Ennaalluage' had a niraval at ‘Konnalu sakethapuravasa…' Clear diction and apt gamakas had the audience captivated during this piece. Mahesh Kumar brought the feel of this kriti alive on his mridangam. Namboothiri then took ‘Saragunapalimpa' in Kedaragowla for detailed exposition. It was laced with creative swarakalpana, which paved the way to a brilliant tani.
Sublime renditions

Cherthala K.N. Ranganatha Sharma's recital captured the attention of music buffs with his sublime renditions that adhered to tradition. Cherthala Sivakumar (violin), Kumarapuram Hariharalakshmanan (mridangam) and Deepu (ghatam) accompanied the vocalist. Gifted with a resonant voice, Sarma's concert was marked for his emphasis on clear diction. He began his concert with a composition by Lalgudi Jayaraman – ‘Neeve gatiyani' in Nalinakanthi (Adi tala). This was followed by Papanasam Sivan's ‘Thathvamariyatharama' in Reethigowla and the rarely heard Bhagavatar's ‘Saranam Vijayasaraswathimaye' in the raga Vijayasaraswathi. ‘Saranam…' had a scholarly swaraprasthara.An alapana of Poorvikalyani, ‘Thillai Chidambaram,' was laced with brilliant manodharmaswara. Dikshithar's ‘Sreevenkatagireesamalokaye' breathed an air of bhakthi to the concert. A rendition of Tyagaraja's ‘Swararagasudharasa' had a well articulated niraval at ‘Mooladharaja…' This was followed by an impressive tani.
N.J. Nandini, a promising young artiste captivated the audience during her concert with her vocal range and aesthetic modulations that reminded the audience of her guru Bombay Jayasree. Thiruvizha Viju S. Anand (violin), A. Ganesan (mridangam) and Vivek (ghatam) accompanied Nandini.She started the concert with ‘Vanajakshi' in Kalyani. Dikshitar's ‘Sreemahaganapathiravathuma' in Gowla came next. Pattanam's ‘Mariveredikkevarayya' in Shanmukhapriya was ornamented with fast paced niraval amd swarprasthara at ‘Sannuthangasree.'A well-rendered ‘Sreerangappuravihara' and ‘Ninnujappakarana' were ensued by a neat portrayal of Kedaragowla. ‘Saragunapalimpa' was marked by clear sangathis. A complex ragam-tanam-pallavi in Bhairavi ‘Avan en sonthamadi, Govindanadi, Mukunthanadi' and a lively swarakalpana was followed by a superb tani.
Rajeswari Satish, a disciple of maestros M.A. Venugopal, C.S. Krishnayyar and P.S. Narayanaswami took the stage captivating connoisseurs with her pleasing stage presence and crystal-clear padanthara. Sampath (violin), Anilkumar (mridangam) and Dipu (ghatom) accompanied her. She began her concert with ‘Valachvachi' in Navaragamalikavarna that was sung in two speeds and followed by manodharmaswaras. Rajeswari dedicated the song ‘Tharumo nin karunakataksham' to Krishnayyar; a song that he himself composed in Saranga. A charming ‘Ninnenammithinayya' in Simhendramadhyamam was followed by the highlight of the evening, a sparkling Bhairavi. Dikshitar's ‘Balagopala' was ornamented with a niraval at ‘Neelaneeradasareera…' Cascading swarasanchara was followed by a brilliant tani.A performance by flautist K.S. Gopalakrishnan with T.H. Subrahmaniam (violin), Surendran (mridangam) and Guruprasanna (ganjira) was memorable. Gopalakrishnan began the concert with an Adi tala varnam in Darbar ‘Chalamela.' Dikshitar's ‘Mahaganapathim' in Natta had dazzling swaraprasthara. The violinist who was in tune with the flautist added allure to the concert. A crisp rendition of ‘Nadathanumanisam' in Chithranjani was followed by a leisurely alapana of Hindolam, ‘Govardhanagiresam.' It was laced with scintillating swara passages.The highlight of the concert was the luxurious treatment of Thodi. Short and crisp phrases and alternate playing between the flautist and violinist delighted the audience. A lively tani preceded a well-articulated niraval and swarasanchara. Gopalakrishnan wound up his concert with ‘Bhagyadalakshmi baramma' of Purantharadasa in Madhyamavathi.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Fine-blend-of-ragas/article16299075.ece

  | Photo Credit: N_SRIDHARAN Shantanu Bhattacharya's concert captured moments, where one could savour his guru. His performance included the repertoire of his first guru Prasun Bannerji, and had the makings of a scintillating session with Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty , in the great style of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Sahib. Shantanu performed with exuberance the challenging intricacies of the Patiala Gharana.The morning at the Little Play Coop began with the melodic strains of ‘Gunkali' in vilambit, madhya and dhrut laya, where the last piece , “Gao Gunkali Gunijan Mein Gao” showcased a wide variety in expression and technique.
Distinctive alaps
Miyan ki Todi was full of distinctive alaps, which spilled into three-four avartans in full meend and uchhals.He touched the higher notes, lacing them with bol-alaps and created a melody substantiating the raga in a great tradition. The taan patterns were varied and spectacular, restating and redefining the heights that an Ustad usually reaches. In short, Shantanu's performance was a picture-perfect recital reminiscent of his great musical lineage.The second half of the concert was an interactive session, during which Shantanu took ragas with similar swaras but with varying moods such as Jaunpuri and Darbari; Bihag and Maru Bihag; Multani and Miyan ki Todi and Bhopali and Deshkar. He spoke about the strong correlation between the time of the enunciation of the raga and its swaras- a correlation, he pointed out, that actually helped to unfurl a particular raga.For example in the raga Miyan ki Malhar, the combination of ‘ni dha ni sa' dramatises and denotes the coming of clouds. He also felt that Bahar cannot be sung, unless it is Spring and that Bhairav can never be performed in the evening. He also pointed out that occasionally, the composition hailed the ragas. Finally with the coming of Bhairavi, Shantanu demonstrated how all the thaats with their scales can be derived by shifting scales by one note.The two beautiful compositions from Bhairavi finally established that Shantanu had scaled great heights and finally would cement his place among India's top singers. On the tabla was Debashish, a prolific master of his genre and the two complimented each other perfectly.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Recital-upholds-musical-lineage/article16298787.ece

  'Pramanam' a unique audio-CD having 12 songs of the Trinity was brought out by R. Vedavalli. N. Murali, Senior Managing Director, Kasturi and Sons, and president, Music Academy, released the CD, the first copy of which was received by Umayalpuram Sivaraman. Vedavalli, T.M Krishna and D.R. Santhanam, Senior Member, the Music Academy, were also present on this occasion. K.S. Sudhakar of Swathi Soft Solutions welcomed the invitees and said that it was a great honour to be associated with a project that was of immeasurable value to the whole community of musicians.Calling Vedavalli a matchless vidushi, Mr. Murali said she was holding aloft a tradition of unwavering adherence to sampradaya. Umayalpuram Sivaraman mentioned that “Pramanam” meant taking an oath of allegiance and Vedavalli was an authority on many aspects of music. He also appreciated her boldness and was all praise for the way Vedavalli had prepared her disciples to make them render these kritis in its pristine form.Krishna wished that this disc had seen the light of the day some 30 years ago and cautioned against the loose manner in which the word Sampradaya was being used, in discussing issues. He called the album an authentic document, which should be listened to frequently to gain familiarity. He requested Vedavalli to continue to release such CDs for the benefit of both musicians and rasikas.In response, Vedavalli said that the CD was an attempt to preserve a 150-year old tradition and that she was not compelling anyone to follow the bhani.Mala Mohan of Swathy Soft Solutions and Sumathi Krishnan, a senior disciple of Vedavalli also narrated the pleasant learning experiences they underwent while getting this CD to its present form. Smt. Pankajavalli read out a “Vazhthuppaa” as a tribute to Vedavalli. The event was efficiently compered by Shivapriya, Vedavalli’s disciple.There was a soulful rendering of some of the kritis by Sumithra Vasudev, Malini and Sumathi Krishnan to the accompaniment of Ram on the mridangam, prior to the commencement of this function.

227,First lady of nagaswaram,V. BALASUBRAMANIAN,2010-05-06,17:51:15 IST,"Nagaswara vidwan Madurai Ponnuthai in Madurai. Photo: S. James
  | Photo Credit: S_James. It is the third day of the Chithirai Brahmotsavam (Chithirai Peruvizha) of the Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. The simmering heat not withstanding, the milling crowd heads towards the temple and the asthana nagaswara vidwans are getting ready for their concerts. After the darshan, we set out to meet the octogenarian nagaswaram vidushi Madurai M.S. Ponnuthayi, once a regular at the temple festivals.Today, living on a paltry pension of Rs.1,000 and supported by her only son, this first lady of nagaswaram, who was once a sought after musician within the State and without, has turned philosophical and accepts life as it comes.Though she belonged to a family of musicians well versed in the flute, the violin and the mridangam, her father decided to train her in nagaswaram. Shifting base from their native village Ayakkudi near the Palani Hills, to Madurai, Ponnuthayi came under the tutelage of Madurai Natesa Pillai. The veteran recalls, “Classes would begin in the morning and would go on for hours. In fact, my guru was criticised for teaching a tiny girl.” The instrument requires plenty of lung power and energy to produce sound in a sustained manner for several hours. Hence, the nagaswaram was dominated by male players.
Rigorous practice
After classes, practice at home went on for hours. “These hours and hours of practice helped me overcome the initial struggle of even producing a note. My arangetram was in the 1940s. A huge crowd had gathered curious to see who the nine-year old girl playing the nagaswaram was, which hitherto was considered a male bastion. Soon the word spread and I was called to play as a supporting artist for many leading vidwans. Concerts with T.N. Rajaratnam Pillai, Tiruvengattaar and Tiruveezhimizhalaiyar are still etched in memory. I was just in my teens then!” Ponnuthayi has even played in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.“I played for AIR Tiruchi first in 1946 and this went on till about 1989. This helped a lot in my name spreading faster. Offers to play at temple festivals and marriage functions started pouring in. Naturally, I formed my own group comprising support nagaswaram, thavil players and talam. It was support from temples that helped sustain us. Getting noticed at such festivals earned us opportunities to play in marriages. I was never bogged down by the taxing schedules of temple processions which went on for 12 hours at times! As if to prove a point against my detractors, I withstood this strenuous schedule, thanks to the Blessings of the Almighty,” Ponnuthayi remembers and shows us some old photographs of hers with child-like enthusiasm.“My popularity grew beyond Madurai and I started playing elsewhere in the State. Once during a performance in Kerala, I received a medal from the organisers after I was pitted to play against a local nagaswaram player. Mind you, it was an impromptu competition.” She has played continuously for three years in the late 40s in Sabarimalai, as a thanksgiving to Lord Ayyappan, the presiding deity of the temple, whom she believes, saved her life when she was seriously ill during a concert tour of Kerala. She considers her concert at the Second World Tamil Conference a prestigious one.Ponnuthayi has many titles to her credit, the first being ‘Nada Gana Arasi' awarded by the Madurai Tamil Sangam and the last being the Kalaimamani. She values the appreciation of the audience during and after a concert more than titles and awards. “It is those humble words of appreciation that pep up the proceedings for me,” she says.
The master of Thodi
Her favourite ragam and player? “Thodi and TNR,” pat comes the reply. She continues, “Yes there are other ragams that I like but with Thodi, we can go on exploring its depths for hours. Again, TNR was the master of it.”Incidentally, Microsoft has taken a recording of Ponnuthayi's Thodi to be played at its headquarters in the U.S. under the category of Indian Music. Apart from M.S. Subbulakshmi, Ponnuthayi was the only other woman musician from South India to have been featured in an exhibition in Japan several decades ago. “An American girl Karisha King who visited this exhibition came all the way to learn nagaswaram from me for about a year.”Happily married to Madurai Chidambara Mudaliar, she went on to scale greater heights as he encouraged her tremendously. He was a Legislative Council Member for about three years and was part of the Congress party. It was after his passing away in 1972 that her professional life took a downward slide; engagements for playing in weddings abruptly stopped because of the prevalent stigma of a widow playing the mangala vadyam.About music then and now, Ponnuthayi has this to say. “We had to really toil hard to learn a kriti or a ragam. It took several months before we could master them. Today it is vice versa. Everything is available in capsules and is just a click away. Kritis are grasped at a rapid pace and forgotten as quickly.” She demonstrates by singing the Hamsadhwani varnam which she learnt when she was nine. The sruti alignment at this ripe age is something unbelievable.Her grandson Vigneswaran, a mridangam vidwan, has started learning the basics of nagaswaram from her. He teaches music in a local school and heads a group called Madurai Ponnuthayi Isai Alayam that gives Carnatic performances in and around Madurai. Ponnuthayi also teaches music to the locals there. Vigneswaran is planning to start a music school in his grandmother's name to perpetuate both music and Ponnuthayi's name.As Ponnuthayi blows the seevali to pose for photographs, we request her to play. But she politely turns us down saying she is weak. As this writer takes leave of her, he remembers the days when his father would tune in to AIR Tiruchi with difficulty just to listen to late night concerts of Ponnuthayi and make everyone at home listen to her.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/First-lady-of-nagaswaram/article16298782.ece
228,‘An artist is responsible for enhancing music quality',LALITHAA KRISHNAN,2010-05-06,17:31:34 IST,"Letting his deft fingers do the talking as they work magic on the strings, vainika Bonala Sankara Prakash is the walking, strumming proof that hard work pays. His music mirrors a rare blend of technique and aesthetics, strength and tenderness, creativity and accountability within the framework of tradition. The artist shares his thoughts on the present and future of the veena in the cutcheri milieu and the discipline that goes into the making of an artist.

Initial Steps…
I began playing the veena at age of five and gave my first full length concert at 9. My mother Ramani and father Bonala Jagannathan are veena and vocal vidwans. My father, who is my guru, remains my greatest source of inspiration. He imparted the subtleties of sampradaya sangeetham with emphasis on the techniques of veena playing. He was a disciple and close associate of the late Vasa Krishnamurthi, a legendary veena vidwan of the Bobbili tradition, renowned for four centuries. My maternal grandfather, trained in classical music, was also a mridangam artist in the bhajana sampradaya. He ensured that I stayed constantly tuned to musical thought.
Fostering the listening habit…
My father often took me to vocal and instrumental concerts of stalwarts, particularly the annual series in Vishakapatnam. Immersed in music at that impressionable age, I experienced immense joy. Those unforgettable cutcheris have been an everlasting source of inspiration for the contemplation and analysis of the myriad intricacies of melody, rhythm and technique, then and now.
Reaping harvest through sadhana…
Following the example of my father and guru who put in at least 10 hours of practice daily, I followed this schedule diligently for 25 years. Today, this sadhana stands me in good stead. Initiated early into manodharma aspects in a natural and phased manner, I find that its boundless creative scope gives me the highest satisfaction as an artist. Technique is a means to an end. Once command over technique is achieved, the musician tends to devote more time to contemplation. This inner communion leads to manifestation of greater bhava.
Evolving a style…
An artist’s style evolves as the result of years of experience, assimilation and absorption. I work towards an ideal combination of heavy gamakas and ravai sangatis through coordination of right and left movements to realise the maximum potential of the veena as well as sahitya bhava sans unnecessary meetu. This approach has contributed to my handling of ragam, tanam, pallavi and niraval. Singing whatever I learnt before playing it has ensured that my instrumental expression closely shadows the vocal.
Responsibility as an artist…
The celestial timbre (naadam) of the veena strings has filled my waking hours and been my mainstay since childhood. The Saraswathi veena has been revered since ancient times and the vainika aims for closest possible adherence to vocal expression. Every artist carries the responsibility of enhancing the quality of music and the aural experience and garnering greater exposure for quality music. I believe in one putting one’s shoulder to the wheel to produce ennobling music. I leave no stone unturned in this endeavour.
The role of AIR…
As a staff artist, I have received great encouragement from AIR right from the beginning. The awards I won at AIR annual competitions spurred me on to translate my passion into my profession. My participation in South Zone concerts, National Programmes, RTP specials and award-winning musical features such as ‘Ekoham Bhavishyami’ on AIR as well as Doordarshan programmes were enriching experiences. The opportunity of listening up close to AIR concerts of great musicians has been a steady source of inspiration, ideas and insight.
The current scenario with regard to the veena…
Nowadays, few students opt for the veena due to the hard work, late rewards and difficulties involved in portability of the instrument. We need new entrants with the commitment to take it up as a full time profession. While it is heartening to note that some organisations have begun convening veena fests, it would be a fillip to see more vainikas featured in regular concert series. As an artist, I look forward to performing opportunities on a wider platform to create and sustain audience interest.
Performance chart…
In addition to solos, I also give jugalbandhis and have performed with Hindustani musicians such as Purbayan Chatterjee and Janardhan Mitta.
Awards and recognition…
I got the gold medal from the Vishaka Music Academy (1996) and Best Performance award for three consecutive years from Navya Nataka Samithi (1984-86). I have received Sankranthi Puraskar from the Pushpagiri Peetam and to have been honoured as Asthana Vidwan of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam (2008). In 2006, at the request of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams, I tuned devotional songs for the Bhajana Yagna project and conducted the music for 108 songs in an audio release.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/lsquoAn-artist-is-responsible-for-enhancing-music-quality/article16298776.ece
229,Ragas handled with profundity,PVK,2010-05-06,17:09:21 IST,"The composing of thillanas, since the earliest known composer of this musical form Melattur Veerabadriah, has undergone many changes and the last century has seen many vidwans who have made their contributions as composers of thillanas. It would be no exaggeration to state that the art of composing thillanas has reached its zenith with the creations of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Jayaraman's thillanas have gained immense popularity among music lovers, vocal and instrumental performers and have been acclaimed by the traditionalists as well.Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and his sister Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi have presented eight thillanas of their illustrious father in this audio compact disc brought out by Charsur Digital Work Station.The Desh raga thillana is the composer's one of the most popular compositions, probably next to the evergreen Mohanakalyani thillana. The siblings have chosen an appropriate kalapramanam for this opening number and is an apt curtain raiser for the fare which follows.
Clear lyrical content
Great care has been given to the bowing by the violinists while rendering the sahitya portions and the differentiation between the jati syllables and the sahitya are clearly distinguishable. The sahityas do not become an extension of the jatis. The lyrical contents are distinctly clear in the charanam sections.Karnaranjani raga, sporting a tricky Arohanam ‘SRGMGPDS' has a sampoorna Avarohanam ‘SNDPMGRS' (derivative of Kharaharapriya), has been handled with the genius of the composer in the thillana in this raga. It is very sensitively played and does not portray the raga as a mere scale. The melody comes out in full glory and is very engaging.The next number is the adi (tisra nadai) tala set Behag raga thillana which was frequently rendered by M.L. Vasanthakumari in her concerts.Following this are thillanas in Bageshri, Vasanti, Bimplas, Dwijavanti and Madhuvanti. These ragas are very well suited for compositions which serve as tukkadas in a concert. The Vasanti raga thillana is the lengthiest one in this disc and has an eerie opening which suits the melody and warrants a second listening.Perfection has been Lalgudi's hallmark and his offspring live up to this reputation in this disc.The percussionists J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and S. Karthick (ghatam) are seasoned artists and follow the compositions like a shadow. Their playing greatly enhances the listening pleasure.

230,Sketching ragas with ease,G. SWAMINATHAN,2010-05-06,16:48:03 IST,"SWEET VOICES: The Serugudi Sisters.
  The vocal concert of the Serugudi Sisters at Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam was creditable because they included some compositions which are not often heard on concert platforms. A Tamil varnam in Atana provided a zestful start to the proceedings. Tyagaraja's ‘Ninne Bhajana' in Nattai and ‘Graha Balamemi' in Revagupti were pointers to the siblings' interest in projecting the raga images with emphasis on specific sangatis. A few strands of tepid swaras were affixed to the Revagupti kriti.Rema ventured on the elaboration of Rishabhapriya with motifs strong enough to distinguish it from Charukesi. ‘Mahathmule Teliyaleruni' by Mysore Vasudevachar augured well with the dynamism of the kriti adding swara sallies on ‘Mahi Sudha', the anupallavi line. The niraval surfaced only in the Ritigowla kriti of Tyagaraja ‘Chera Ravathe', on ‘Talli Tandri Leni Bala Tana Nathu' with swaras; but here, notwithstanding a melodic raga like Ritigowla, the niraval fell short of emotional aspect.
Well-rehearsed
The core piece was Madhyamavati, which was taken up by Geetha as preface to the Tyagaraja composition ‘Venkatesa Ninnu'. Here the swaras were on the pallavi and moved to the extended kuraippu swara sorties with ‘sadhjam' as the landing note. All swara exchanges in this concert were concluded by both the sisters, with well rehearsed and impressive korvais. On the positive side, the sisters articulate well with full throated expressions. Rationally speaking, they recite well but the missing part is the internalisation of any raga or song which would add charm to the raga, kriti or swara. Well, spontaneity is different from a forced synthetic approach.The fast paced phrases in raga alapana and swara surges can temporarily impress the audience; but it is the evenness in the alapana and how the raga is spread out that will help the performers in the long run. Both Rishabapriya and Madhyamavati were good treatises but offered nothing special or specific to muse or ruminate over later either by the rasika or the singers. This statement holds good for the theoretically correct interpretations of songs sans soul too.With the voices almost identical, sweet and in their control, experience should impart the importance of searching for the spirit and sharing the same with the listener…this is musical wisdom. Hope Rema and Geetha learn this. A few more pleasing kritis were in their kitty; ‘Srihari Vallabhe' in Suddha Dhanyasi by Mysore Vasudevachar, ‘Ranganayakam' in Nayaki by Dikshitar, ‘Manavyala' in Nalinakanti by Tyagaraja and ‘Smarajanaka' in Behag by Swati Thirunal were worth recording.Kovai Chandran more or less presented the raga images in the same style as that of the sisters, offering sound without much soul. Kalakkad R. Srinivasan and Rajaraman on the mridangam and the ghatam provided able support and a tad aggressively framed ‘thani'.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Sketching-ragas-with-ease/article16298754.ece

  Carnatic vocalists Ranjani and Gayatri are among the top artistes on the Carnatic music scene today. As youth icons, they bolster one's confidence in the future of Carnatic music. It was fitting that Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Delhi, honoured them with the title of “Nada Bhushanum” during its annual Tyagaraja festival not long back.Gayatri said the award was a recognition of their hard work and dedicated it to their parents, rasikas and accompanying artistes.Ranjani and Gayatri are known for their melodious and vibrant voices, and their fertile imagination has won them rasikas from across the world.Ranjani takes the lead in sharing her views on the invaluable compositions of the musical Trinity — Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastri. She feels they seem fresh even years after they were composed. “When the audience listens to a kriti, it should make them to sit up and experience the wonder of the raga,” says Ranjani. “As performers we try to bring out the beauty and joy of the raga which is intangible. The listeners should be able relate their feelings with the raga.”Gayatri, bright-eyed, continues: “Without deviation from the traditional system we like to explore new ideas and be innovative in our approach.”Ranjani points out the debt of gratitude she and her sister owe to their parents for their interest in music and tirelessly taking them to concerts when they were young. “It laid a strong foundation. Music is a journey, and we both wish to travel as long as we can.” It was a journey that began with the violin. It was P.S. Narayanaswamy who recommended they give vocal performances, and thus began their metamorphosis from violinists to much sought after vocalists in the Carnatic music world. The duo's effortless singing, especially of vrittams, is a treat for listeners. Their diction and control over raga presentation in the fast tempo speak volumes for their hard work and dedication to maintaining quality. Calling their father a perfectionist, they say they owe their success to him.Gayatri adds, “We have come a long way in vocal performance. What our fingers used to speak, we are expressing vocally. Exposure to Hindustani music has helped us, but music is beyond boundaries. Listening to various forms of music helps a singer, since the good values of music get into your system unconsciously, effortlessly.”Ranjani recollects her teenage years as an accompanist to stalwarts like D.K. Pattamal. They remember her generosity in accepting the child artiste. “The humility and will to make the accompanying artiste comfortable in those days are values we wish to imbibe and cherish,” says Ranjani.Though popular performers, the sisters are cautious of excess. Ranjani says they space out their concert schedule to ensure the health of their vocal chords. “The numbers are not important. We wish to give memorable performances.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Two-to-crescendo/article16299942.ece
232,Tribute to Swati Tirunal,A. Sangameswaran,2010-05-06,16:26:22 IST,"Shreyas Narayanan
  A three-day festival of dance and music dedicated to Swati Tirunal was held at Sree Koodalmanickam temple in Irinjalakkuda.The concert on the first day was by Shreyas Narayanan. He was accompanied by Nellai Ravindran (violin), Melattur Balasubramanian (mridangam) and Thrikkakara Y.N. Santharam (ganjira).A disciple of P.S. Narayanaswamy, Shreyas maintained the purity and perfection of the tradition he belongs to and sang each kriti in a tempo that best suited the piece, thereby enhancing the beauty of the whole recital. The swara passages he sang for the opening piece ‘Devadevakalayamithe’ in Maayamaalavagowla were reminiscent of the Semmangudi bani. The grandeur of Atana was revealed in the kriti ‘Sree Kumara Nagaraalaye’, which was sung at a slow pace.
Fast paced renditions
In contrast came ‘Jaya Jaya Padmanabha’ in Sarasaangi, in Madhyamakaala tempo and the accompanying swara passages. Bhairavai was taken for alapana before the Navarathri kriti ‘Jananimaamava’ and was tagged with niraval and swara passages. A fast paced ‘Bhogeendra sayinam’ in Kunthalavarali set the stage for the main kriti of the evening ‘Raamaraama Guna seema’ in Simhendramadhyamam. Shreyas rendered an erudite alapana, his full throated voice effortlessly scaling through the three octaves.While traversing through the upper octaves, he made sruthibhedam resulting in the raga Bhauli, which was later reproduced by the violinist in his solo essay. The kriti was well rendered with niraval and scintillating manodharma swaras. Nellai Ravindran on the violin and the percussion accompanists contributed to the success of the concert.A sedate ‘Raamachandraprabho’ in Sindhubhairavi, a kriti by Vanamaamalai ‘Janaki Ramana’ in Kaappi and an Abhang ‘Theerthavittala’ in Aaahir bhaiarv constituted the final phase of the concert.On the second day Mathangy Sathyamoorthy accompanied by Vayala Rajendran (violin), B. Jayaram (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreekanth (ganjira) gave a memorable concert. The artiste chose a fine blend of popular and rare kritis so as to please the crowd.The ‘Sarasijanabha’ in Kambhoji was followed by ‘Pahi Sreepathe’ in Hamsadhwani for which she sang an array of swaras. Panthuvaraali was executed in detail and was followed by the kriti ‘Saarasaakshaparipalaya’.
Supple voice
This as well as ‘Kripayapaalaya’ in Charukesi and ‘Maamavasada’ in Kanada was well received by the audience. ‘Bhavaye Padmanabhayiha’, a rarely heard Madhyamaavathi kriti was rendered well. Lalyani was taken for a detailed alapana revealing all its glow and charm before the kriti ‘Paripahimaamayi’, which was the main item for the day. Her supple voice and amazing control over it gave an added colour to the whole concert. ‘Bhajabhajamaanasa’ in Sindhubhairavi and a thillana in Dhanasri concluded the concert.The third day had Moozhikulam Harikrishnan, an up-and-coming singer, rendering ‘Rama Rama pahi’ (Devagandhari), ‘Sree Parvathi’ (Bhauli) and ‘Kalayedevadevam’ (Ranjini) among other kritis. He showed promise during his Kalyani alapana followed by the kriti ‘Sundareeneedivyamu’. He was ably assisted by Aadarsh (violin), the grandson and disciple of Nedumangad Sivanandan and by Krishnachandran (mridangam).
Display of histrionic skills
A Bharathanatyam solo by another promising youngster Aiswarya Raj was the final event of the festival. The dancer displayed her histrionic skills during the Bhairavi pada varnam.‘Shankara Srigiri' in Hamsanandi brought out the skills as a dancer in her as she portrayed the pranks of little mischievous Krishna in ‘Vishamakara Kannan’ of Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer.She wound up the recital with a Kunthalavarali tillana. Arun Gopinath (vocal), R.L.V. Anand (nattuvangam), Raghunath (flute) and Venu Kurumassery (mridangam) were the accompanists. In addition to these there were concerts by devotees and disciples before the main concerts. The fete was organised by Sree Koodalmanickam temple.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Tribute-to-Swati-Tirunal/article16298748.ece
233,Captivating notes,Harish Bal,2010-05-06,16:16:32 IST,"Captivating notes: Amith Nadig
  A flawless gayaki (singing) style is what most flautists strive to achieve. Amith Nadig has accomplished this and much more.Training under veteran R.K. Srikantan, Amith is one of the few youngsters to be awarded an A grade from the All India Radio. The flautist captivated the audience with his mellifluous music in a concert at Kochi recently.He began the concert with a sprightly rendition of the Abhogi varnam ‘Evaribodha' in three speeds. Mysore Vasudevachar's Roopaka tala composition in raga Kamboji, ‘Lambodara' had a neat niraval. Edapally Ajith (violin) followed it up with excellent swara essays Unexpected scale shifts and the ease in playing high octave passages marked the flautist's swaraprasthara. Considering the difficulty in achieving clarity in fast phrases in high octaves, this was a good feat by the young flautist.
Erudite performance
Next came a brisk rendition of ‘Niravadhi sukhada' in raga Ravichandrika. The best alapana was of a subsidiary piece in Kalyani, in which the artiste adeptly caught the true fervour of the raga. The elaboration unravelled the artiste's wide manodharma and flexibility in merging quick, distant phrases together. The kriti chosen was Swati Tirunal's ‘Pankaja lochana' in Misra chappu tala.The korvai swaras came in all blends and delighted the audience. After a peak into Bilahari raga, Amith played ‘Smarasada manasa' in the same raga. A progressive approach to essay raga Keeravani saw the artiste follow the note-by-note approach. He covered all the essential nuances of the raga bringing out the quality of the raga. Tyagaraja's ‘Kalikiyunde gada' was rendered with a brief niraval on ‘Bhagavathagre sarulaku.'K.U. Jayachandra Rao on the mridangam left no loose ends, packing up the gaps fully. He was quick to grasp the rhythmic patterns of the swara phrases and caught up with the mukthaippus correctly. Amith seemed to muse at phrases as he went on improvising on single phrases in subtle myriad ways. The tani with just the mridangam was another flawless exercise.Amit retained the heaviness of the concert in the concluding pieces as well. ‘Govardhana giridhara' in Darbari Kanada and ‘Tamburi meetidava' in Sindhubhairavi. Thus in the few numbers that the flautist played, he could unfold the true Carnatic flavour and essence of the music. The programme was organised by Dharani society.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Captivating-notes/article16298744.ece

235,Second Thoughts: Come with old Khayyam ,NAVTEJ SARNA,2010-05-06,18:56:53 IST,"The other day, halfway through a virtual conversation, or chat, I found myself unable to recall a much loved rubai of Omar Khayyam. This lapse, unimaginable in one’s youth but part of the daily landscape now, soon had me searching the bookshelves. I was looking for my Omar Khayyam and unconsciously, I was looking for that coverless, disintegrating Jaico edition that I had bought in the mid-1970s for two or three rupees from the booksellers who used to shout “take a look, buy a book” in the corridors of Connaught Place. The book with the tempting sketches of the hedonist resting against a tree and drinking cups of heady wine from the hands of a sinuous saki under a full moon, sketches which, in a summer of artistic delusion, I copied on chart paper and hung all over my room. But that book was nowhere to be found; it has not survived the three dozen years and the dozen or so moves. Instead, I found three other Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, each an embodiment of pure physical beauty. The first, barely the size of a pocket dictionary, has a rich rust-brown cover depicting a medieval garden with intertwining branches, full-bodied roses, singing birds and fruits in the boughs. Each page featuring a single rubai, or quatrain in Persian, is framed like a carpet from the same land. The English version, with 102 rubais cramped into a few pages, is based on Edward Fitzgerald’s translation from the first of his five editions. This edition can be distinguished from the later ones by slight differences in some of the rubais. The most famous of these is: Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough,/A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou…….; in the third and later editions this becomes: A book of verses underneath the bough/A jug of wine, a loaf of bread – and thou…I found this little gem of a book in the bookshop in the gardens of Hafiz’s tomb in Shiraz, where newly-weds come to seek the blessings and a turbaned dervish with deep set eyes and a flowing beard walks around the chai-khanah. The second is a very slim 1955 production that I found tucked away in a second-hand bookstore bursting at the seams. The rubais, once again based on Fitzgerald’s first edition, are all inscribed on dull yellow pages and the remarkable accompanying miniature depictions of hedonistic abandon are in the same yellow and pastel pink. This edition satisfies itself with 75 quatrains and ends with the emblematic signature phrase Tamam Shud or “it is finished.” And the third has nothing miniature about it; it is a large, lush and generous coffee table book entitled The Wine of Nishapur harking to the capital of Khorasan, which once rivalled Cairo and Baghdad and where Khayyam was born in 1048, as well as buried in 1131. This book is based on the belief that in order to fully understand Khayyam, it is not enough to master the Persian language; one has to be Iranian and have “breathed the same air, felt the same spring breeze on his cheeks, enjoyed the same picnic in the meadow…”Using an all-Iranian team, it combines the English rendering of 72 rubais by Karim Emami and the skilful Persian calligraphy of Nasrollah Afje’i with the perceptive photography of the man who has put it all together - Shahrokh Golestan. The photographs are a non-literal, philosophical take on Khayyam- red sunshades of a side-walk café (each Nowruz hold tulip-fashion a bowl of wine), a long shadow of a passerby (whence is the entrance and whereto our exit?), the sun’s last rays on raindrops (the moon will wax and wane over and over again)… Incidentally, nobody quite knows how many rubais Khayyam actually wrote. In the oldest extant manuscript, copied 500 years ago in Shiraz and now held in the Bodleian Library, there are 158. In later versions, succeeding scribes added more until the total swelled to nearly 1200. Edward Fitzgerald culled out the essential ones and rendered them in a free English translation, or as he called it a “transmogrification,” in 1859. He did not pretend to be too faithful to the original, often combining more than one rubai to make a brilliant whole that reads as one poem and not as separate epigrammatic quatrains. Incidentally, there was an Indian connection: his colleague, Prof. Edward Cowell discovered a Persian manuscript of the rubaiyat in the Asiatic Society of Calcutta and sent it to him. The resulting book went almost unnoticed and was soon in the one-penny boxes on the streets until it found admirers in the poets Rosetti and Swinburne (followed by Hardy, Elliot and Conan-Doyle) and went on to become one of the most famous, essential and oft-quoted books for the next 100 years. In his lifetime, Omar Khayyam was known not as a poet but as a philosopher, mathematician and astronomer. It is difficult to believe that his most influential work was a treatise that demonstrated the problems of algebra in which he solved cubic equations through intersecting conic sections; if you don’t understand that, please join the club. He made far-reaching reforms to the Persian calendar, linking it to actual solar transit. He was in fact the precursor to non-Euclidian geometry and to a heliocentric view of the world. In addition, he wrote on mechanics, geography and jurisprudence.It is for this work that the man - who has hundreds of wine-houses named after him - is also commemorated in a lunar crater on the far side of the moon and in a minor planet - 3095 Omarkhayyam - discovered in 1980. One can only conclude that his scientific mind and philosophical bent questioned Divine providence and finding no answers to the perplexities that he encountered, he preferred to focus on the fleeting and sensual pleasures of the material world. Fitzgerald’s rendering of Khayyam’s rubaiyat has eclipsed the other achievements of this remarkable man, at least to the English speaking world, in a manner best expressed by Khayyam himself: 
Indeed the idols I have loved so long

Have done my credit in mens’ eye much wrong;

Have drowned my honour in a shallow cup

And sold my reputation for a song.

238,Staging a change,SANGEETA BAROOAH PISHAROTY,2010-05-06,17:10:30 IST,"Sitanath Lahkar has made his passion blossom. Photo: Anu Pushkarna
  Mathematics is his earning source, theatre his soul. Sitanath Lahkar, professor of mathematics at the prestigious Cotton College in Guwahati, has long been a student of theatre, an ardent advocate of the curative powers of arts, particularly theatre, in a society that is in constant flux. His group, Samahar Natya Goshti, which celebrated its silver jubilee last year, has a repertoire of about 50 plays, all scripted by Lahkar. “I act, direct and write plays. That way, I am a one-man theatre group,” he says in jest.In New Delhi on a private visit, Lahkar languidly reconstructs his initiation into theatre. “No one from my family did plays before me. In 1965, as a school student in Nalbari, I staged a one-act-play. It became a local sensation. I should say that was my starting point.” Having continued his interest in play-acting and play-writing for years, Lahkar came up with the idea of his own troupe in early 1984. “But it got its impetus after theatre activist Safdar Hashmi was killed in 1989. As a group that began with the slogan of theatre with a purpose, we took Safdar's murder as a serious blow to our goal,” he recollects. Soon after, Samahar started street theatre, not just in Guwahati but in remote villages across the North East. “Samahar has 19 street plays. We did about 350 shows then to tremendous response. We were the only group then to do street plays in the region,” he mentions.Lahkar brought his “Kahiyo Sandhi Das” to the 2003 edition of Bharat Rang Mahotsav in New Delhi. He says, “All our plays are about issues touching our society. This play is about surrendered terrorists, termed SULFA. In 1996, when many ULFA cadres surrendered to the Government, they became legalised terrorists. While they got all the Government privileges, they also continued with their armed extortions. It became a new problem in our society.”Among other interesting subjects his plays have dealt with are Assam's student agitation, the serial blasts in Assam, the State's notorious LoC financial scam, the Babri Masjid demolition, communalism, casteism and unemployment.Believes Lahkar, “That serious plays don't attract common people is an utter lie. I have done plays in the interiors, sometimes with just one tube light on, in both bitter cold and scorching summer. I have always got a full house.”In a village called Sokihali in Lower Assam some time ago, he says, “We staged a play in front of 9,000 people. The sound system didn't work for 45 minutes. People waited till it became all right. In yet another place near Nalbari, we performed the play ‘Matir Dheep' in front of 3,000 people with just Petromax lights.”To Lahkar also goes the credit of reviving the memory of Brajanath Sarma, considered the father of the popular mobile theatre in Assam. Sarma was also the first to introduce women actors to the stage. In his memory, every September since 2007, Samahar hosts the Brajanath Sarma Memorial Drama Festival, inviting theatre groups from across the North East and West Bengal. “We do it between September 12, his birth anniversary, and September 15, his death anniversary,” he adds.With a lot of interest, Lahkar informs us that Samahar now has a permanent address. “Finally, we have managed to have a concrete place for our rehearsals. We started off from a cowshed,” he says with a laugh. Paucity of actors, particularly due to lack of money in theatre, he adds, “is a serious problem.”“Most actors in my troupe work elsewhere to run their homes. Often they find it difficult to take out time for rehearsals. It has been a constant problem not just with my troupe but with most in the region. There is hardly any sponsor available. Rabindra Bhavan, the only big auditorium in Guwahati, charges Rs.10,000 for one shift, while we sell tickets to theatregoers for Rs.20 each. It is not easy for theatre groups to survive there,” he points out.Samahar's “Ma Nishada” found a place in the National School of Drama's Octave festival held in Goa last year but Lahkar sums up the conversation stating, “NSD should consider bringing out new plays of new groups from the region to a wider audience every year. But the same troupes keep getting invitations to Bharat Rang Mahotsav year after year.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Staging-a-change/article16298768.ece
239,In Ghalib's skin,DIWAN SINGH BAJELI,2010-05-06,16:49:22 IST,"“In recent years, we have seen several plays and a few serials on Mirza Ghalib. They have caricaturised a great poet by focusing on his relationship with courtesans and their coquetry, Ghalib's drinking and gambling habits interspersed with his popular ghazals. I was pained to see them and decided to project the real personality of the great poet in the context of his troubled personal life and the history and culture of his times. For five years, I studied works by Indian as well as foreign scholars on Ghalib and finally completed the project,” says Charan Das Sindhu, author of 36 plays. “Ghalib-e-Azam,” his latest offering, was premiered at Shri Ram Centre recently under the direction of Ravi Taneja, his son-in-law.
Creative vision
Endowed with a unique creative vision, he writes in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi with equal felicity. His Ghalib is a great poet and a great man who suffered one heartbreak after another and was betrayed by his close relatives. “The death of one child is too much of a shock that breaks one's heart. Ghalib lost seven children when they were in their infancy but he endured all this displaying great fortitude, sharing these deeply tragic moments with his dear wife Umaro Jaan,” says the playwright. “To add to his woes, he had to look after his mentally ill brother — who is said to have been killed by a British soldier during the 1857 revolt.”In “Ghalib-e-Azam,” Sidhu has dramatised three significant events in Ghalib's life — his struggle to get a family pension from his estate Loharu (Rajasthan), his pain at the untimely death of his children and the deep bond with his wife who silently suffered the loss, and his journey to Calcutta and stay in Banaras. Sidhu says he has incorporated into the thematic structure Ghalib's compassion and faith in man despite betrayals, his profound humanism and his contribution to India's tradition of composite culture.To convey the universal relevance of Ghalib's poetry and life, the playwright has devised a chorus which includes references from Charvak philosophy from the Rig Veda, lyrics from Bulle Shah, Kabir, Nanak, Amir Khusrau, Ravi Das and Tulsi Das. The chorus is aimed at reinforcing the humanistic philosophy of the poet. “I believe in Shajjad Zahir's assessment of Ghalib. He said that Ghalib was much, much ahead of his times and was a visionary and a genius to visualise the dawn of a new era which would ensure man freedom and the light of scientific knowledge. I have tried to dramatise all these aspects in a play that runs to two hours and 40 minutes.”A former professor of English at Hansraj College, Sidhu did his MA and Ph.D. from Madison, Wisconsin, in the U.S. and is passionately devoted to theatre. His 33 published plays in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi have been staged and some translated into EnglishA prolific writer, he was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2003 for his play “Bhagat Singh Shaheed: A Trilogy.” His plays could broadly be placed in three categories — plays of social protest, those that critique the educational system and those based on history.Sidhu never uses literary language in his plays. He comments, “I belong to the tradition of Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Munshi Prem Chand. I use the language spoken by the common man and try to capture its vigorous, vivid and effective expression.”What prompted Sidhu to write one play after another for nearly three decades is the encouragement and collaboration of his family. His wife Gyan Kaur played lead roles in most of his plays, his daughters acted too, and now his son-in-law directs and acts in them. In a way, his entire family is his repertory company.Sindhu's plays have evoked keen interest in the academic field. So far, 15 scholars in Punjabi have obtained their Ph. D. degrees on various aspects of Sidhu's works.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/In-Ghalibs-skin/article16298755.ece
240,‘Theatre is my life’,NEEHAR MISHRA,2010-05-06,16:45:21 IST,"Actor Anjan Srivastava. Photo: Mohammed Yousuf
  | Photo Credit: Mohammed_Yousuf He made his mark in theatre and on television when he successfully essayed the role of a typical common man in “Wagle ki Duniya”. With successful tele-serials and films in his kitty, veteran actor Anjan Srivastav is now all set to appear in a cameo in the SAB TV show “Maniben.com”. Here, he talks to us about his long acting career and his future projects.
Could you tell us something about your the character that you are playing on the show?
I play a retired colonel, who is fond of collecting antiques. He is a man of old values and a high temper. He has collected a scooter which belongs to Maniben. The episodes deal with how she tries to get the scooter back from Colonel.I think Smriti is a great actress, one of the best on television. I worked with her previously in “Viruddh”. I have worked before with Contiloe Productions in a few episodes of “Krishna Arjun” and with SAB in “Sahib Biwi Ke Ghulam”. So all three are well connected with me.
For a large part of your acting career, you kept your bank job. How did you manage?
I feel you should just go on doing work. I pursued my acting career and at the same time I did my bank work on the telephone. Fortunately, my chairman gave me all the necessary facilities. I also managed getting good publicity for the bank with my association with actors. I feel I am just doing what's written. And if you wish, you can manage anything.
You are soon to begin shooting for “Detective Wagle”, a sequel to your famous show ‘Wagle ki Duniya'. How is Wagle from “Wagle ki Duniya” different from Wagle in ‘Detective Wagle'?
Wagle is now retired and he wants to do something after that. His wife is still employed and is frustrated with his attitude. He wants to become a detective now and keeps reading detective books. One day he sees an advertisement in the paper about an actress' ring having been stolen. He goes to the police and offers to help find the ring. The police, of course, do not take him seriously because they don't think a retired clerk can be of much help. The show is about how Wagle becomes a detective and tries to solve the case.
Theatre, television, cinema films…Which is your favourite actor's medium?For me, it's theatre, because it has no technical bar. Every performance, every show in theatre has something new, because unlike film or television, it does not capture you in film. I feel that an actor's job is to create, understand and live a character, which is only truly possible in theatre. Theatre is my life. If it dies, so will I.
What are your future plans?I will soon start shooting for “Detective Wagle” and I also have Farah Khan's film “Tees Maar Khan”. I cannot do just any show. For me, the offer has to be up to the mark. Even when it comes to cinema, I like to do only quality films. I am always ready for Raj Kumar Santoshi and Kundan Shah. They are the ones who discovered me and made me what I am. So for them, I am always there. Other than that, I want to see my children well settled in their career.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/lsquoTheatre-is-my-lifersquo/article16298753.ece
241,Of the star-struck,P. ANIMA,2010-05-06,16:42:00 IST,"A scene from the play.
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr taramandal2 “Taramandal” leaves behind a clutch of endearing, enduring images. Amputated ambitions waft through the play, yet keep the mood light. Probably, that's the strength of “Taramandal”. Written and directed by Neel Chaudhuri, the play presented by Tadpole Repertory, recently took home The Hindu MetroPlus Playwright Award. Performed at Akshara Theatre this past week, “Taramandal” boasts some skilful performances, but its bane is its length.Taking off from Satyajit Ray's short story “Patol Babu, Filmstar,” “Taramandal” burgeons into many tales akin to Patol's fate. If Patol's persistent fascination for acting is smothered by a mere exclamation in a movie, he has many comrades in “Taramandal” — a production predominantly in English with a smattering of Bengali and Hindi. Patol's story runs as the linking thread, as many similar tales of ambition, creativity, heartbreak and disappointment unravel along the way. None of them bog you down by the weight of loss — the lines keep laughter close at hand.The play opens with Patol's dream turning into a nightmare — an actor/king robbed of his crown. The sentiment is of an aspirant reaching out to his/her aspiration, yet never finding it within grasp.
Creative disenchantment
“Taramandal” arrests creative disenchantment at different levels. For young Madhav it is not being part of the Beatles musical in school. Reba and Sanjeev thrive in picking up instances from life and enacting them. They merge the idea of the real and the imagined. Acting takes them to realms within themselves, hitherto unknown. So when Sanjeev leaves for Mumbai to dabble in acting, it is his creative chemistry with Reba that dies prematurely.Dushyant tells a familiar tale — of a theatre actor at heart steered to medicine to keep alive family tradition. “There was a genuine effort to convince me that we were the most advanced stage of the species. ‘Doctor man',” he announces to squeals of laughter.Lavanya, a wannabe actress, and Vicky the agent, give a convincing story of many aspiring actors in filmdom. Devika, the Omniphone model, never rises beyond the only contract she has.Amongst this profusion of stories, Patol lingers. He is sketched immaculately, but it is Andrew Hoffland who breathes life into him. He is superbly believable as someone who would listen to Mozart in the dark to fit into the character given to him. His starry gaze and his quiet equanimity even when he knows all he has to say is “Oh!” — all delicately bares Patol.The sets of a few portable boxes and planks work well in “Taramandal.” It evokes a quaint sense of the space, which anyway shifts rapidly. Actors work with military precision after each scene getting in the sets. At times residues and sets from the past scene lingers on giving a sense of the whole. The lights don't play truant either.But “Taramandal,” at close to two hours, suffers, as those part of it loved it too much to trim it. Silence is a potent weapon in a play; it does have a power that words often don't. But in “Taramandal”, silences have been pampered and stretched. Since all sub stories have a similar fate, editing out one, or pruning the tales wouldn't have tampered with the soul. In the crucial scene, where Patol gives the shot of his lifetime, director Aruna Malik sits with her back to the audience. So when she says, “Clap when we're ready, and please don't say “Action” this time,” the exasperation on her face is left to us to imagine.Despite the flaws, “Taramandal” succeeds in delving into nooks of an actor rarely seen.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Of-the-star-struck/article16298756.ece
242,Return of 'Raktharakshas',Sangeeta,2010-05-06,16:17:41 IST,"A scene from the drama 'Raktarakshas'
  | Photo Credit: S.MAHINSHA Nothing seems to move the Malayali like nostalgia does. Song remixes and film remakes have had their due, and now its time for theatre re-runs.Pegging on the memories and emotions of a bygone era, Kalanilayam Drama Vision has re-opened its flagship production, ‘Raktharakshas.' The 30-year old play, directed by Kalanilayam's founder Krishnan Nair and written by Jagathy N. K. Achary, is currently running to full houses in Thiruvananthapuram.
Rooted storyline
The technical finesse and the rooted storyline plus the horror genre can be quoted as obvious reasons for the play's success. Besides there is its landmark invocatory song, ‘Salkaladevi than…,' which has attained a rather anthem-like status.The newer version of the play, which was re-designed to suit the ‘modern taste,' has been cut down to two hours and 40 minutes from the original four-hour duration. The soundtrack was reworked with advanced electronic systems and the scenes re-structured to incorporate dynamic visual effects.“I was aware that the nostalgia factor and the goodwill of the banner will bring in crowds. But Jagathy Sreekumar and I wanted to elevate the play into the contemporary cultural space; hence the efforts to makes changes in the aesthetics. We thus kept the basic storyline intact and re-worked on the external factors. And while incorporating the new additions, we saw to it that we did not go out of form,” says Anantha Padmanabhan, son of Kalanilayam Krishnan Nair.The drama company is currently managed jointly by Jagathy Sreekumar (son of Jagathy N. K. Achary) and Anantha Padmanabhan. The duo decided to revitalise the company in 2003. The original troupe was disbanded after the demise of Krishnan Nair.“We decided to go for a second run as we believed in theatre and its relevance in society. And the movement for us was not a tedious job, but a way of life,” asserts Ananthapadmanabhan, whose mother happens to be one of the oldest actors of Malayalam theatre.“My mother, Kodungallur Amminiyamma, had a close association with Kalanilayam, both as an actor and as the founder's support system. She had immense passion for acting. I remember her telling me about the physical strain she had while performing the play ‘Malabar Lahala.' She was nine months pregnant then. I have been fed and brought up on drama. The same goes for Sreekumar, I believe,” adds Anantha Padmanabhan, who is all set to helm the renaissance of Kalanilayam Drama Vision.The group, which has more than a hundred staff including actors, technicians and ground staff, swears by its manpower.“A play like ‘Raktharakshas' demands concentration, timing and consistency. The effects you see on stage are not computer generated. They are actually physically done by backstage hands. Without such talent and commitment, it wouldn't be possible for us to run the show,” he says.The cast of the ‘Raktharakshas' includes Kavitha in the lead, with Santosh, Sasi, Sukumaran, Thankachan and Sathyan in the supporting roles. The vibrant stage setting has been done by Jagannathan, a long term associate of Kalanilayam. The sound effects are by Jijo and the lighting by Ramchandran and Shijo.“Kalanilayam was once a wonderful treasure house of actors. Veterans such as Aravindaksha Menon were active members of the troupe. Their plays such as ‘Raktharakshas,' ‘Kayamkulam Kochunni,' ‘Elayidathu Rani,' ‘Taj Mahal' and so on banked heavily on actors. It would be great if this new troupe can groom and mould a new set of actors,” hopes R. S. Madhu, a theatre practitioner and a retired school headmaster.
Theatre in the mainstream
Kalanilayam's efforts in pushing theatre back into mainstream comes at the right juncture as the Malayali cultural space is more or less void with cinema entering a crisis and television nearing monotony. And theatre being the most vital form of self-expression, will find its way through in any cultural context.And the evidence? ‘Raktharakshas'; the play with its 30-year-old text and a very conventional stage form, has made it into the minds of the masses minds indicating the changing tastes and sensibilities. Also evident is the Malayali's open mindedness and receptivity towards any work of art done with seriousness and commitment.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Return-of-Raktharakshas/article16298745.ece
243,Endpaper: Tryst with the masters,PRADEEP SEBASTIAN,2010-05-06,19:09:34 IST,"Like everyone in the room I lusted after these books, but was too shy to caress or even touch them. They were beautiful, rare, uncommon. And very expensive. $500 for a book was cheap here. The average price of most of the books I was looking at was $15,000. Several were half a million. Like the fourth Shakespeare folio that beckoned from the window at the Peter Harrington booth. In the next booth was the other legendary antiquarian book seller from London, Bernard Quaritch. They were all here, 200 rare book dealers I had only heard or read about, from London, Paris, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Milan, New York, and San Francisco. They had brought with them the brightest copies of some of the rarest books in the world to show and sell at the 50th New York Antiquarian Book Fair.The fair, sponsored by the ABAA (Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America) is perhaps the most important rare book fair in the world. It takes place every year in April for four days at the Park Avenue Armory, a cavernous stone structure in the heart of Manhattan. For several years now the fair has been organised by Sanford L. Smith and Associates, ‘the foremost arts and antiques show management company'. I might have spent the rest of the fair just gawking at these books without touching them if it wasn't for Angel, a witty, erudite, vivacious young woman at the Bauman's Rare Books booth who simply threw open the closed glass shelves, encouraging me to handle them. She knew the provenance and bibliographical points of these editions intimately. She took out from the shelf a signed and inscribed copy of The Fountainhead, and handed it to me, noting that Ayn Rand had inscribed it to the architect who had helped her research the book. Price: $56,000.
Old friends
Soon, I was handling copies of first printings of books that I had once known only in text book form. In my hand, for instance, was a first edition, first issue of Keats' Endymion, 1818, Octavo, uncut, top edge gilt. A copy that possibly the poet himself may have once touched. A few minutes later, I was holding a signed, inscribed first edition of Forster's A Passage to India, Edward Arnold, 1924, Octavo, original half brown cloth, gray paper spine label. Oscar Wilde's Poems, 1892, signed. (Signed!). I put it back and picked up a copy of A Room of One's Own, Hogarth Press, 1929, limited issue. One of 492 copies signed by Virginia Woolf in her characteristic purple ink. Original cinnamon cloth. I exchanged that for a copy of The Wasteland, signed by Eliot.And just a little later, the book in my hand was the true first edition of Alice in Wonderland, the earliest known edition, preceding the first published London edition, 1866, beautifully rebound with 42 illustrations by John Tenniel. I realised, with a shiver, that I had just touched the very same copies that these authors had held in their hands. I stopped by at Imperial Fine Books to say hello to Bibi Mohammed, special for being one of the few South Asians in the antiquarian world and one of very few bookwomen in the trade. It was a particular treat to meet in person Allen and Patricia Ahearn of Quill and Brush, who put out the definitive book on modern collecting prices, and that renowned contemporary bookwoman, Priscilla Juvelis, specialising in Artists books.I was interested in modern first editions but there were so many dealers with so many bright copies of the high points of modern firsts, that they nearly became commonplace! Only at the New York fair! And most of the copies here were not only in mint condition, they were also signed. First printings of The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, The Hobbit, a whole run of Ian Fleming, Philip K. Dick, Pynchon, Wodehouse, all signed. Bright first issues of The Dharma Bums, Naked Lunch, Moby Dick, Dracula. Advance reading copies of the first Harry Potter book. Anywhere else, these copies would be considered hard to find, but here it was raining high points. At Biblioctopus you could browse through a complete set of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan, dust jackets intact and signed!I went looking for that holy grail of modern first editions: the true first edition of The Great Gatsby, in that scarcest of dust jackets. And found it, naturally, at Between the Covers Rare Books. It was nice to finally meet the folks at BTC, Tom Congalton and Dan Gregory, who put the book in my hands, and explained how this copy had all the points to make it the true first edition. The price? $175, 000. BTC also possessed one of the highlights of the fair: an inscribed first issue of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises in that very, very scarce dustjacket. I was also in search of my own personal holy grail among modern firsts: a signed first edition of The Catcher in the Rye, but no one seemed to possess the grail.However, Ken Lopez Bookseller, another legendary book dealer in modern firsts, sharing the booth with BTC, had, what was at least for me, the next best thing: the first state printing of Salinger's Raise High The Roofbeam Carpenters in the hard to find edition lacking the dedication page. Only 20 or so copies of this state are known to exist in the market. I opened it, saw it lacked the dedication myself, and handed it back, feeling very privileged. In fact, every moment at the fair was a privilege; a bibliographical shock. Peter Harrington had a Shakespeare folio, something I had only seen pictured in catalogues before. And no one seemed to mind when I cautiously took it out of the glass bookcase and carefully, very carefully, turned the pages.
Aesthetic surfeit
By the time I had done just one round of the booths, I had handled books that few people ever see, much less touch: a copy of Origin of Species that Darwin had held, a copy of the New Testament that Martin Luther had used, an illuminated Book of Hours from 1455, incunabula (early printed books before movable type), antique maps, a complete set of Winnie the Pooh, signed by A.A. Milne, original Pooh drawings of E.H. Shephard, the very scare privately printed copy of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit (80, 000 pounds), the very scarce first printing of Don Quixote, the Olympia editions of Lolita, first editions of Kierkegaard's Either/Or and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, signed sets of Kipling, Jane Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Flaubert, Sylvia Plath, and issues of the Strandmagazine in which the Sherlock Holmes stories had first appeared.It was enough to make any bibliophile swoon. I decided to leave before I actually fainted from so much aesthetic shock and ecstatic bookishness. But I was going to return of course, with two more days of the fair, I couldn't resist. As I walked out, I looked at what I had bought: several lavish and beautifully illustrated book catalogues. It was all I could afford at the New York Antiquarian Book Fair.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/pradeep_sebastian/Endpaper-Tryst-with-the-masters/article16123614.ece

246,People welcome verdict with firecrackers,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,23:29:37 IST,"Mumbai citizens burst firecrackers, distributed sweets and relived memories of the November 26, 2008 massacre as soon as they heard the order on Thursday of the Special Sessions Court sentencing Kasab to death by hanging. Crackers went off in South Mumbai in the predominantly Muslim areas of the city, and people carried placards welcoming the verdict. Various groups came out on the street with banners and posters, passing sweets around.At Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), where Kasab and Abu Ismail wreaked havoc, crackers were burst to welcome the verdict. People queued up to pay homage at the memorial to victims. Right from 10-year-old Devika Rotawan, who was a witness, to Kavita Karkare, wife of the killed police officer Hemant Karkare, families of victims and survivors have been demanding death for Kasab for that night of horror which claimed 166 lives.For Assistant Police Inspector Hemant Bowdhankar, this was the day he was waiting for ever since he helped in the capture of Kasab. Mr. Bowdhankar was part of the police team from D B Marg police station which stopped Kasab and Abu Ismail at Chowpatty as they drove up in a stolen silver Skoda on the night of November 26, and engaged them in a short gun battle.The Mumbai police will always remember the sacrifice of policeman Tukaram Ombale who fell to Kasab's bullets that night. The death sentence has vindicated somewhat his sacrifice, feel the policemen. Mr. Bowdhankar told TheHindu: “I was expecting the maximum punishment for Kasab. Everyone did a good job of giving evidence and the truth was what made the difference. We all welcome this judgment.”Another policeman, who was part of this team and who does not wish to be named, says that this is a judgment that should make all Indians proud. It was the result of teamwork of the Mumbai police, and the Indian judiciary showed the world how it could conduct a fair trial. This is a moment to feel proud of our judiciary as well, he said.However, Ms. Karkare, while welcoming the death sentence, was disappointed that two persons were acquitted in this case. Kasab should not be given an opportunity to go to the Supreme Court and his sentence should be executed immediately, she added.Vaishali Ombale, daughter of Tukaram Ombale, expressed fears that the punishment would be delayed. She, like many other families of victims, called for a speedy end to the whole thing.
“Fit punishment”
Vishnu Zende, the announcer at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) who repeatedly made announcements asking people to clear the station that night, was happy. “I saw what Kasab did that day at CST and this is a fit punishment. Nothing less would have done. We are all very happy to hear this verdict,” he said.The government too welcomed the death sentence for Kasab. Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal and State Home Minister R.R. Patil praised the judiciary and Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, and said there must be no delay in executing Kasab's death sentence.Mr. Chavan said the verdict reflected the public sentiment. The trial was fair and democratic and ended within a year. He complimented judge M.L. Tahaliyani and also senior police officials, Rakesh Maria, Deven Bharati and the Mumbai police for the way in which they handled this case.Mr. Patil said India was a soft target for terrorists and this judgment should send a strong signal to the world that terrorism would not be tolerated. Considering the gravity of charges against Kasab, that of waging war against India and murder, it could be nothing less than the death sentence. Given the brutality of the attack, the punishment seemed less, he said.Mr. Patil once again said that all those convicted who were in Pakistan must be brought to India and the world community must bring pressure on Pakistan to do so. Responding to newspaper reports that the State had no hangman, Mr. Patil said the government would find one.He said the government would appeal to the Centre to fast track the legal procedure so that there was no delay in executing the sentence. In regard to the acquittal of the two Indians in the case, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, Mr. Patil said the government would file an appeal against it in the High Court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/People-welcome-verdict-with-firecrackers/article13637475.ece

249,India among the worst 10 climate polluters: study,IANS,2010-05-06,10:39:52 IST,"A man rows his makeshift raft in the polluted Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad. File photo: AP.
  India figures among the world’s worst 10 countries causing environmental damage, according to a new study which lists Brazil as the most polluting country.The research led by professor Corey Bradshaw, of the University of Adelaide’s environment institute, has placed India at seventh position while ranking the US and China as the largest carbon producers after Brazil.The 10 countries with the worst global footprint were Brazil, the US, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru, it said.Countries were measured on a range of indicators, including fertiliser use, natural forest loss, habitat conservation, fisheries and other marine captures, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat.The study, published in the science journal PLoS ONE on Wednesday, found Australia’s carbon emissions, rate of species threat and natural forest loss were the greatest contributors to its ninth—place ranking, according to The Age.“If you’re clearing a lot of forests, you tend to also to overharvest in the ocean and use a lot of fertilizers,” Prof. Bradshaw said explaining the link between development and environmental damage.He said finding the US and China in the top 10 were not surprising, though he was surprised that a relatively poor country such as Brazil took out the top spot.“The wealthier you are, the more damage you do, on average,” he said. “It’s just a function of human nature. Growth is the be—all and end—all for all economies around the world, and if you’re not growing economically, you’re stagnant, and therefore that’s a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that’s unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Prof. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Prof. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Prf. Bradshaw said the better—ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven’t wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we’d consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/India-among-the-worst-10-climate-polluters-study/article16298674.ece
250,U.S. tightens no-fly rule after Shahzad’s near escape,PTI,2010-05-06,10:38:36 IST,"After Times Square bombing plot suspect Faisal Shahzad managed to pass through several layers of security at the New York airport to board a Dubai-bound flight, only to be stopped minutes before take off, the U.S. has tightened its no-fly rules for airlines.The new rules, enforced yesterday by the Transportation and Security Administration, came within two days of Shahzad’s fleeing attempt.The Pakistan-born U.S. national boarded a Emirates flight, even though his name was added to the no-fly list of the United States on Monday.Under the new regulation, airlines now have to check the government’s no-fly list within two hours, which was earlier 24 hours, after they are notified that a name has been added.“It’s being done because a review of the situation finds that an airline is required every 24 hours to check the no-fly list. The suspect’s name was entered a little after noon, I believe, on Monday, therefore, though on the no-fly list, the airline didn’t have to check necessarily at that point,” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said at his daily news briefing.“The new rules require that to happen at a two-hour interval if airlines are notified that somebody’s been added as a risk to the no-fly list,” he said, adding the reason there were redundancies in the system to ensure that there are many mechanisms that would allow one to prevent somebody from flying, which is what happened in this case.“The CBP (Custom and Border Patrol) takes a locked manifest, that’s required to be filed 30 minutes before a flight, with people that are on the plane. That was checked against that list and the individual was removed from the plane,” Gibbs said.Shahzad nearly escaped arrest with only around 20 minutes left for take-off and planes gates closed but the tide turned later - the gates were reopened and he was arrested.The Pakistani-American was placed on the expedited no-fly list Monday at 12:30 afternoon.Seven hours later at about 7:30 pm, he was able to purchase a one-way ticket to Pakistan all by cash. The flight was scheduled to leave at 11:45 pm.“In his case, the airline seemingly didn’t check the name, and the suspect was allowed to purchase a ticket and obtain a boarding pass,” a senior administration official told The Washington Post.“Under the new measure, the airline would be required to re-check the list within two hours of being notified of a special circumstance expedited no-fly name,” the official was said as quoting by the daily.However, Emirates Airlines in a statement said it “fully cooperated with and responded immediately to all local and federal authorities on all matters” related to the flight in question.The airlines also said it is fully compliant with all US passenger check-in procedures and works closely with the US government “to update security watch lists on a regular and timely basis.”Meanwhile, a group of Democratic Senators urged the US President Barack Obama to issue an executive order that all airlines would automatically have to alert the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) if a passenger seeks to buy an airline ticket with cash.Senators Benjamin L Cardin, Charles E Schumer and Mark Udall said the new policy would bolster airline security until the end of the year, when airlines’ responsibility for checking passenger manifests against the no-fly list is scheduled to shift entirely to the TSA.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/U.S.-tightens-no-fly-rule-after-Shahzadrsquos-near-escape/article16298678.ece

Do it in a phased manner. To say we don't have funds and we can't do it is not the answer. What could be a greater need than protecting human lives? You need Government of India funds and till then you can't set up shelters? How can the Chief Secretary say like this in an affidavit? Do you know how your State will be painted in the eyes of the world?”The Bench said: “I am sure the Chief Minister has not seen the affidavit. Otherwise, this type of affidavit will not be filed. The entire country is on one side and you are on the other. You file a better affidavit after it is vetted by the Chief Minister.”The Bench, in its brief order, lauded the steps taken by Andhra Pradesh and Delhi for formulating a comprehensive scheme for providing shelter to the homeless. The Bench said the sensitivity shown by them required to be emulated by other States. Copies of these affidavits should be sent to all the Chief Ministers and Chief Secretaries for adoption, the Bench said and posted further hearing on July 21.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Supreme-Court-pulls-up-Bihar-for-lsquowe-dont-have-funds-affidavit/article16298605.ece

  | Photo Credit: Damian Dovarganes Google Monday snapped up a top Canadian startup which pioneered a 3D interface technology for Mac and Windows PCs.Called Canada's hottest software startup, Toronto-based BumpTop has been acquired by the search engine for reportedly between $30 and $45 million, according to reports. However, there were no details of the deal by the two sides.Set up just three years ago, BumpTop has pioneered touch-screen software that allows use of multiple fingers at a time on a multiple touch screen.Called ‘desktop workspace,’ the software allows users to organise pictures, documents and videos much more intuitively. Users can perform many functions with their fingers, including dragging of items into docks, and playing around with photos on desktop.Though Google has not specified how its will use this pioneering technology, it is certain that it will use touch-screen software in its smart phones based on its Android operating system.Since its Android operating system is basically geared for touch-screen technology, rather than keyboard technology, Google's mobile market strategy is aimed at taking on Apple's iPhone and iPad that use touch screen technology.The acquired Toronto company will no longer sell its software independently after May 7.In a statement on its website Monday, it said, “Today, we have a big announcement to make: we're excited to announce that we’ve been acquired by Google! This means that BumpTop (for both Windows and Mac) will no longer be available for sale. Additionally, no updates to the products are planned.”The acquisition of BumpTop is the fifth such deal by the Mountain View-based Google within a month as part of its strategy to take on Apple.Just last week, it had acquired Labpixies that develops social games for mobile services and Facebook. Agnilux, Plink, and Episodic are the other three acquisitions made by Google within a month.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/Google-acquires-3D-software-pioneer-to-take-on-Apple/article16298798.ece

Ahead of Apple's iPad coming on the block analysts predicted pain for Amazon.“We're quite comfortable having a diverse range of physical retailers, whereas most of the other players would like to have a less competitive space, because they'd like to dominate,'' said a Google official.Google confirmed to the BBC that Google Editions would not be affected by the firm's present legal troubles over trying to digitise millions of out-of-print books.“Plans for Google Editions will happen independent of whatever the settlement agreement is,'' said a Google's official.The search giant's efforts to create the world's biggest digital library have been mired in legal action for the last couple of years.Critics have long claimed Google's deal with U.S. publishers and authors would give them a monopoly over online book sales.Google said it would make “millions of books searchable via the web''A ruling on the issue is due soon. — © BBC News/Distributed by the New York Times Syndicate",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Google-enters-digital-book-war/article16298858.ece

This can be easily crossed especially in case the Kurdish parties, strong in northern Iraq, support the merger.Analysts say consolidation of these factions is a victory for Iran which is highly influential among the Shia formations in Iraq.The Iraqi National Movement or Iraqiyah, headed by former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, slammed the formation of the new Shia coalition as a move to isolate his party. The Iraqiyah party had won 91 seats, the highest among any single formation which contested the March 7 elections.Apart from achieving a simple majority, the Shia bloc has to cross two remaining hurdles. First, it has to agree on its choice of a new Prime Minister. Observers say that the chances of Mr. Maliki getting a second term are slim because of the stiff opposition to his name by the 40-seats strong group led by Shia cleric Moqtada Al Sadr. The former Prime Minister, Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, Adil Abdul Mahdi, currently Vice-President, and Baqir Jabr are the other heavyweight contenders for the post.Second, the Shia parties are debating the incorporation of the Iraqiyah formation, which has wide support among the large Sunni minority, in a new national unity government. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, headed by Ammar al-Hakim, which is part of the new Shia super-coalition, has been insisting on the inclusion of “other national forces” in the new government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Iraqs-major-Shia-blocs-to-merge/article16298855.ece

  Millions of undecided voters held the fate of Britain's political leaders on Thursday as polling was held for the most closely-contested general election in a generation with opinion polls pointing to a hung Parliament while giving the Tories sufficient edge to be able to form a minority government.Tory chief David Cameron, accompanied by his heavily-pregnant wife Samantha, was the first of the three main party leaders to vote and the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg the last. His wife, Miriam, accompanied him to the polling station but was not able to vote because she is a Spanish national.On what could be his last day as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown looked remarkably cheerful as he briskly walked into the polling booth with his wife Sarah and warmly greeted journalists and party supporters gathered outside. After a gruelling campaign, all three leaders travelled to their constituencies to cast their votes.Mr. Brown ended his campaign with an emotional appeal to disenchanted Labour voters to “come home'', while his two rivals called for “change'' after 13 years of Labour rule with Mr. Cameron urging voters not to let “fear triumph over hope'' and Mr. Clegg saying people had an opportunity to ‘change Britain forever''.With as many as 40 per cent of voters said to be undecided all parties were able to claim that there was still everything to play for. The tension was, especially, palpable in the 100-odd key marginal seats where a swing of a few hundred votes could make the difference.Tories, in particular, invested heavily in Labour marginals, some held by leading Labour figures, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Ed Balls, Schools Secretary and one of Mr. Brown's close confidants.
Late surge
Labour claimed a late surge of support among women voters in marginal constituencies saying the election would be decided “around kitchen tables and in living rooms''. Lib Dems' hopes of snatching a number of marginal Labour and Tory seats appeared to fade after failing to sustain the momentum they had gained on the back of Mr. Clegg's barnstorming performance during the leaders' television debates.Polling would close at 10 p.m. (local time) and first results are expected around midnight though a clear picture is not likely to emerge until late Friday morning.No official figures for voter turnout were available at the time of going to the press.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/U.K.-elections-on-a-knife-edge/article16298851.ece

Photo: AP.
  Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a tough test on Sunday, when almost a quarter of Germans go to the polls after this week’s decision to bail Greece out with billions of euros of government—backed loans.On May 9, voters in North Rhine—Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, will be asking how to fill the gaping holes in city budgets as they elect a new regional parliament — while Greece stands to benefit from Germany’s perceived generosity.The majority of Germans oppose the Greek bailout, of which Merkel has pledged the lion’s share, fuelled by a media campaign portraying Greeks as corrupt, lazy and undeserving of German aid.Eight months into Ms. Merkel’s second term, the vote is also a key hurdle for the coalition between her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP), whose popularity has plummeted during their time in office.North Rhine—Westphalia’s 13.5 million voters have frequently set the future course for German federal politics.If the state’s current CDU—FDP government is ousted on Sunday, it would cost Ms. Merkel her slender coalition majority in the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house of parliament representing the federal states, making it tougher to push through promised economic liberalization.Opinion polls show no clear favourites in North Rhine—Westphalia, traditionally a Social Democrat (SPD) stronghold, after an election campaign dominated by such issues as school reform and financial shortages.The reputation of state premier Juergen Ruettgers, of Ms. Merkel’s CDU, was tarnished by a funding scandal when it emerged earlier this year that a party official was offering private meetings with him in return for cash.His main challenger, the SPD’s Hannelore Kraft, is little—known beyond North Rhine—Westphalia, where the 48—year—old hopes to become the state’s first female premier after a rapid rise within her party.Greece’s request last month for a eurozone and International Monetary Fund bailout could not have come at a worse time for Ms. Merkel, who has been widely accused of trying to put off the unpopular decision until after the North Rhine—Westphalia election.The chancellor has since been at pains to convince voters that a Greek bailout was the best move for Germany. After cabinet gave the go—ahead on Monday, Ms. Merkel hurriedly convened a press conference and gave a series of television interviews.“A stable European currency has an incredibly high value,”the chancellor said, justifying the rescue package with the “emergency situation“that Greece found itself in.Asked on television whether she feared a voter backlash at the weekend, Ms. Merkel insisted the real question was whether the government had done everything to save the stability of the euro and protect German interests.“I think this question can be answered with a clear ‘yes’ — and I think the people know that,”the chancellor added.If Ms. Merkel does not receive the hoped—for backing at the polls, this could set a worrying signal, in a state seen as a bell—weather for German federal politics.In 2005, Ruettgers led the CDU back to power for the first time there in 39 years, forming a coalition with the FDP which was a forerunner of the coalition at federal level last year.According to opinion polls, the governing coalition is neck—and— neck with the alternative pairing of Social Democrats and Greens, who governed North Rhine—Westphalia until their national government fell out of favour with voters.However, neither the CDU—FDP nor SPD—Greens looks likely to win the necessary majority to govern. One alternative could be a CDU coalition with the Greens, testing the waters for a possible replication at federal level.Alternatively, the SPD and Greens could bring the radical Left Party into the fold — a move seen by many as a political taboo, due to the Left’s roots in the former East German communist state party.The SPD’s Kraft has repeatedly insisted that the Left Party is “neither able to form a coalition, nor to govern” — although they consistently poll above the five—per—cent hurdle required for parliamentary representation.Sunday will also be a vote of confidence for Ms. Merkel’s coalition partner, FDP leader Guido Westerwelle.

Segun Adeniyi, chief press secretary to Yar’Adua, confirmed that the President died about 9 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Wednesday in Abuja.Mr. Yar’Adua, 58, had been suffering from a heart ailment since November, which necessitated his seeking treatment in Saudi Arabia and Vice President Goodluck Jonathan assuming office as acting president.A former governor of the northern state of Katsina, Mr. Yar’Adua was elected president in 2007 following controversial general elections.His term was dominated by speculations over his health, as he has suffered a chronic kidney condition for at least 10 years.In the last three years, Mr. Yar’Adua has twice been flown to Germany for emergency treatment and visited hospitals in Saudi Arabia.In February, Mr. Jonathan became acting president following Mr. Yar’Adua’s three-month absence as a result of pericarditis, an inflammation of the lining of the heart.Mr. Jonathan, 52, was elevated from vice-president on February 9 by the Nigerian National Assembly in Yar’Adua’s absence.Yar’Adua, 58, had not been seen in public since November, when he went to a Saudi hospital for treatment of the heart. He departed without invoking constitutional measures to temporarily hand over power, leaving Nigeria with a political and legal vacuum.After both chambers of the legislature voted to install Mr. Jonathan as acting president, Mr. Yar’Adua returned to Nigeria and reoccupied the presidential palace but remained out of sight.Mr. Yar’Adua was a Muslim from northern Nigeria, while Mr. Jonathan is a Christian from southern Nigeria.In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences for the death of Mr. Yar’Adua, in a White House statement.“We remember and honour President Yar’Adua’s profound personal decency and integrity, his deep commitment to public service, and his passionate belief in the vast potential and bright future of Nigeria’s 150 million people,” Mr. Obama said.He praised Mr. Yar’Adua’s work “to promote peace and stability in Africa through his support of Nigerian peacekeeping efforts as well as his strong criticism of undemocratic actions in the region. He was committed to creating lasting peace and prosperity within Nigeria’s own borders, and continuing that work will be an important part of honouring his legacy.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Nigerian-President-YarrsquoAdua-passes-away-after-long-illness/article16298747.ece
269,India Post is on Twitter,Sandeep Joshi,2010-05-06,22:32:52 IST,"The Department of Posts, one of India's oldest establishments, has become the first government organisation to be on the social networking site Twitter. Tilted ‘PostOfficeIndia,' the DoP's page already has around 200 followers, from both India and abroad, in less than two months of its operations.As part of its new business strategy, the DoP wants to leverage this unique medium to promote its business, as is being done by leading food chains and other firms in the U.S. and Europe. Though some senior DoP officials are currently managing the web page, soon it plans to have a dedicated team of people to answer queries of followers and paste latest promotions and programmes of the department. It also plans to have sub-categories for various users such as business users, foreigners and have posts State and region-wise.It all began with the DoP posting information about new schemes for users. It posted links to its website telling users how they could calculate postage tariffs or know pin codes of their respective areas. Then recently, the DoP launched SMS tracking facility for Speed Post shipments and told people how they could make use of it.Similarly, through Twitter, the DoP has already started an awareness campaign for India's biggest-ever stamp show that will be held in Delhi next February. It has also been sending messages to people who want to partner DoP in various projects or apply for some tender. Followers have also been making complaints and giving feedback about how to improve the functioning of the department.DoP's Twitter page is also proving to be a boon for those who pursue philately as a hobby, as it has been informing people about limited edition stamps that India Post issues from time to time. “Welcome to the amazing world of the great magician P.C. Sorcar” read a ‘tweet', asking people to get India Post's commemorative postage on the magician. Through another message – India Post greets you on Earth Day! Let's spare a thought for the future of the planet. Let's all join to put together sustainable lifestyles — it is trying to send social messages and connect with those on Twitter.Senior DoP officials are excited by the initial response from its followers. “Wow, Indian Post is on twitter...that's great to hear” wrote one Indian follower, while a few foreign nationals have also shown interest in India Post's Twitter postings. The DoP has been taking special initiatives for foreigners. For instance, during the recent Pushkar festival in Rajasthan, which is very popular among foreigners, it informed tourists about the post office near the fair where special arrangements were made for sending mails and parcels, which received good response.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/India-Post-is-on-Twitter/article16298859.ece

  | Photo Credit: Pat Wellenbach It may look like a piece of gel but it’s a new nano-based telecom technology “enabler” that can make computers and the internet hundreds of times faster.The technology, that may be in use only five or 10 years in the future, is being designed by Koby Scheuer of Tel Aviv University's (TAU) School of Electrical Engineering.Mr. Scheuer has developed a new plastic-based technology for the nano-photonics market, which manufactures optical devices and components. His plastic-based “filter” is made from nanometre (a billionth of a metre) sized grooves embedded into the plastic.When used in fibre optics cable switches, this new device will make our communication devices smaller, more flexible and more powerful, he says.“Once Americans have a fibre optics cable coming into every home, all communication will go through it - telephone, cable TV, the Internet,” adds Mr. Scheuer.“But to avoid bottlenecks of information, we need to separate the information coming through into different channels. Our polymeric devices can do that in the optical domain - at a speed, quality and cost that the semi-conductor industry can't even imagine,” Mr. Scheuer says.In the next decade, fibre optic cables that now run from city to city will feed directly into every individual home. When that technology comes to light, the new plastic-based switches could revolutionise the way we communicate.“Right now, we could transmit all of the written text of the world though a single fibre in a fibre optics cable in just a few seconds,” says Mr. Scheuer.“But in order to handle these massive amounts of communication data, we need filters to make sense of the incoming information. Ours uses a plastic-based switch, replacing hard-to-fabricate and expensive semi-conductors.”Semi-conductors, grown on crystals in sterile labs and processed in special ovens, take days and sometimes months to manufacture. They are delicate and inflexible as well, Mr. Scheuer explains.“Our plastic polymer switches come in an easy-to-work-with liquid solution. Using a method called ‘tamping,’ almost any lab can make optical devices out of the silicon rubber mould we've developed.”His biggest hurdle, says Mr. Scheuer, is in convincing the communications industry that polymers are stable materials.“There is a lot of prejudice in this industry against plastics. But this approach could take us to a new level of communication,” the researcher says, according to a TAU release.He also notes that the process is not much different from the way that mass numbers of DVDs are produced in a factory - except Mr. Scheuer works on a nano, not a “giant” micro, scale.His device can also be used in the gyros of planes, ships and rockets; inserted into cell phones; and made a part of flexible virtual reality gloves so doctors could “operate” on computer networks over large distances.These findings were published in Optics Express.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/New-fibre-optics-technology-to-speed-up-internet/article16298792.ece

273,Nagin (1954),Vijay Lokapally,2010-05-06,17:05:26 IST,"It used to be one of the favourite pastimes of the summer vacations. The kids would wait for the snake charmer to arrive and play his mesmerising flute, gradually lifting the cover of his basket to unveil a lethal reptile, its hood greeting the motley gathering to a session of music and dance.As the flute's captivating notes came wafting through, the children would gather under the tree, the girls instantly transformed into intrepid ballerinas, the snake happily forgotten…The kids, swaying to the flute, held centre stage, and only when the reptile hissed angrily would the snake charmer dismiss the enthusiastic young group. The music, and not the snake, remained etched in memory.
Charming tune
It was only many summers later that one learnt the tune was not his original work. It came from a movie called “Nagin.” The tune, created by Hemant Kumar, became the theme for all snake charmers. The man playing the charming been (flute) in Hemant Da's orchestra was Kalyanji, who later joined hands with Anandji to form a highly successful team of composers. You could hear this immortal composition across the country.It is said that when “Nagin” was released, snake charmers entertained the crowd outside the cinema halls during the intermission. It is also said that some theatre owners would engage these snake charmers to keep an eye just in case the tune from inside the hall ‘attracted' a reptile in the neighbourhood.One had heard of a movie hall in Hyderabad being host to an unwelcome ‘guest' during the screening of “Nagin.”
Strength of music
Coming to the storyline, there is nothing exceptional about “Nagin”. Mala (Vyjayanthimala) and Sanatan (Pradeep Kumar) belong to warring tribes and fall in love when she is entranced by his been. The movie progresses on the strength of its music as the two lovers, confronting opposition in various forms, are separated before uniting in a climax that includes five songs in a row.The closing segment of the movie is shot in colour, but it is the black-and-white portion that stands out for Hemant Da's music and Vyjayanthimala's performance.The ethereal Vyjayanthimala, barely 18, illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty, moving around daintily from one song to the other; from the bewitching “Man Dole Mera Tan Dole” to the poignant “Mera Dil Ye Pukare Aaja…” Of course, the soul of the movie remains Lata Mangeshkar's voice and Hemant Da's unforgettable composition to some impeccable lyrics by Rajinder Krishan. Simply unmatched…There are only a few movies that can be counted for their musical score, and “Nagin” remains one of them. When Lata sings “Jadugar Sainyya Chhodo Mori Bainyya” and Vyjayanthimala responds with her dancing skills, the result is sheer magic on the screen. The close-up shots of Vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effort.“Nagin” was a precursor to her rise in Hindi cinema as an iconic actor, who combined her talents, performing and dancing, to rule the screen on her terms.There are a couple of nondescript numbers too, ironically sung by Lata, but tolerable compared to some mediocre stuff that symbolises music today.Hemant Da's contribution to the movie is monumental. He gets the best out of Lata and then lends his voice to an unforgettable duet “Arre Chhod De Sajaniya Chhod De Patang Meri Chhod De”, apart from the solos that have stood the test of time: “Tere Dwaar Khada Ek Jogi”; “Yaad Rakhna Pyaar Ki Nishani Gori Yaad Rakhna” and “Zindagi Ke Dene Wale Zindagi Ke Lene Wale…”The two biggest recall values of “Nagin” are Vyjayanthimala and Hemant Da. The director is Nandlal Jashwantlal; there is a cameo by I.S. Johar; the villain is Jeevan and the hero is Pradeep Kumar; it was a huge hit and fittingly fetched Hemant Da the Filmfare Award. In small towns, it was common to see a man guarding snake baskets outside the theatre screening “Nagin”, for the charmers would all be inside. A pity the snake charmer has vanished in these times, but the charm of “Nagin” has only grown….",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Nagin-1954/article16298764.ece
274,Obsession with marriage,ANUJ KUMAR,2010-05-06,16:58:35 IST,"Director Gurinder Chadha
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr gurinder new Most of the times we find Hindi film heroines are presented as the epitome of beauty. Gurinder Chadha tinkers with this deep-rooted stereotype, which has social ramifications, in “It's A Wonderful Afterlife”, a Chadha comedy releasing this Friday. If the title gives a backhand compliment to Frank Capra's classic, Chadha says the form flirts with the Ealing comedies, the lightly satirical films which depicted British society in the post World War II period. “I have also put an element of ghost. Horror-comedies are common in Britain, but Indian audience have not experienced the genre. Also, in British films we hardly find British Indian characters. I felt the need for both, and we have a ‘masala' film, which has comedy, ghosts, tragedy and reincarnation with a social comment underneath,” says Chadha, who established herself as the voice of the Diaspora with films like “Bhaji On The Beach” and “Bend It Like Beckham”.
Indian obsession
At the heart of the story is the Indian obsession with marriage dealt with in a light-hearted fashion. “Mrs. Sethi is a typical Punjabi woman that we see on the road but hardly ever try to delve into the story of such fat dames. She has a well-rounded daughter, who is not beautiful in the traditional sense. Frustrated after her repeated attempts to get her married, Sethi kills the people who refused her. Interestingly, the ghosts of four such people help her out in finding a groom for her daughter in return for reincarnation.” She says the thought of reincarnation by doing a good deed lends a moral fibre to the film and therein lies the link with Capra's “It's A Beautiful Life”.Chadha assures us she hasn't fallen for the typical solutions that the girl loses weight in the second half and turns into a swan. “Here the character Roopi is ultimately accepted as she is…only her dress sense changes a bit. The filmmakers need to understand that we have a lot of well-rounded women around and they make perfect brides and mothers. In India you will find such ladies in almost every household. The filmy representation is responsible for creating unnecessary pressure on girls to be skinny leading to an unhealthy lifestyle.”Shabana Azmi plays Mrs. Sethi and Chadha says the actress didn't read the script before accepting the offer. “Like many, I also had a serious image of her in my mind but when I met her with Javed Akhtar during the shooting of ‘Bride and Prejudice', I saw the lighter side of her. There I made up my mind to offer her a central role in one of my films. Mrs. Sethi is a complex character. It is not one of those roles where she had to look inside. On one hand it is over the top, as she is interacting with ghosts, which only she could see, all the time, and on the other, there is a tragic underpinning to her character. Only she could have made it look authentic. Those who have seen the film in Britain have called it an Indian Bridget Jones.”Chadha says this time it was different for Shabana, known for her intense preparation for a role. “She didn't know my kind of humour. It was only when she landed in London that she got an idea. I made her watch some Ealing comedies and then she got the hang of things. She observed the gait, walk and accent of Punjabi women in South Hall and incorporated it so well into the character that when curious people trooped in on the sets looking for Shabanaji, they were unable to identify her.”The film also marks Chadha's association with an Indian production house, Studio 18. There is a growing acceptance for her kind of cinema where culture is used as a tool to transcend boundaries. “Coming from a mixed parentage, growing up in London and married to a Japanese American, I understand the problems of the Diaspora better than many others. British people might not identify with the Indian obsession with marriage, but Italians, South Africans and Chinese would. This has happened with most of my films. People have been able to identify with the characters despite cultural barriers on the surface.” Chadha says during her growing up years she missed Asian characters on television and films. “So when I got an opportunity, I attempted to make them mainstream.” Now when she has succeeded, she wants to have fun with it.
Hindi version
The Hindi version of the film is called “Hai Marjawaan”, but if the past is a parameter, the chances don't look too bright as the dubbed version of “Bride And Prejudice” didn't find many takers. “‘Bride And Prejudice' was not essentially made for a Hindi film audience. It was a way to introduce American audiences to Bollywood song and dance and it achieved that goal. I have seen young American girls still dancing to songs of the film in Bollywood night parties. “Hai Marjawaan” is very much my film. It has much more to appeal to the Indian audience, as apart from the theme the comic lines and gags have an Indian touch.”Chadha is now working on a children's film set in Kerala with lots of elephants around. “I believe kids' films have lost their innocence. These days I find them a lot more knowing. Perhaps producers want to reach out to the entire family. The kids of today are much more exposed to the media and perhaps they get the inherent meaning, but do they need to? I want to make it just for kids. Then there is a film on the Indian Freedom Movement from a British Indian perspective.” Is she ready to rub some Indians the wrong way? “Well, every good film does that. Otherwise filmmaking will become a very bland process. It is still early days, but the film in a way represents my life. My grandparents suffered while shifting from India and I have carried that pain somewhere inside.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Obsession-with-marriage/article16299076.ece

  | Photo Credit: 07dfr antaheen The unsung hill State of Nagaland with its recently concluded Indian Panorama Film Festival is all set to become the precursor of things to come. Emboldened with the success of the first ever film festival in Nagaland, the Directorate of Film Festivals is ready to take the concept to other remote States, including those not traditionally known for either their film industry or hosting such fetes. States like Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, not quite known for their cinema, are likely to host similar events later this year.Speaking to The Hindu at the conclusion of the Nagaland fest, S.M. Khan, director, DFF, said, “We want to take the Indian Panorama Film Festival and also National Award-winning films to all parts of the country. We want people who do not have access to quality cinema to have a firsthand experience of acclaimed films in different Indian languages. For the first time we are also going to screen National Award-winning films in various State capitals. Earlier such films could be seen only in Delhi.”
Local content
After Kohima, the next festival is coming up in Shimla from May 28. Like the North East venture, it too shall have around 15 offerings with a mix of feature and non-features films. “In Shimla, we also plan to screen a Punjabi film, if possible. In fact, wherever we host the festival, we will make sure that local sentiment is respected and at least some of the films are in either the local language or they have content that local people can identify with,” Khan said.Unlike Kohima where stars were conspicuous by their absence, Shimla will keep its date with them during the three-day fest. Rahul Bose, Divya Dutta, Abhishek Pathak and Sivan are likely to attend. Among the films to be screened are “Haat: The Weekly Bazaar”, “Harishchandrachi Factory”, “Boond”, “Keshu” and “Antaheen” — the last one having already been shown in Kohima.After Shimla, the film caravan shall roll into Bhopal in July this year. Meanwhile, plans are afoot to take the festival down South, beginning with a three-day venture in Kerala's capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The summer of many challenges and cine feast continues with another possible edition in either Hyderabad or Chennai.“This is probably for the first time in its history that DFF is hosting film festivals across the country. We don't want that the cinema viewing experience should be available to only a handful in metropolises. We want to make it a universal phenomenon. That is why even beyond the Panorama festivals, we are all geared up to have retrospectives of Kamal Haasan and Ang Lee in July this year.” Incidentally, Kamal Haasan was scheduled to have a retrospective in Goa last year. It could not be held during IFFI as it was felt he deserved more than concurrent shows with other luminaries.All the Panorama festivals will conclude well before the International Film Festival of India kisses the coastal State of Goa in November this year.The show goes on.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/The-show-moves-on%E2%80%A6/article16298761.ece
276,Hero of the common man,Saraswathy Nagarajan,2010-05-06,16:30:17 IST,"Film Director Sathyan Anthikkad. Photo: C. Ratheesh Kumar
  | Photo Credit: C.RATHEESH KUMAR Sathyan Anthikkad continues the saga of the common man with his film ‘Katha Thudarunu,' which reaches theatres today. Scripted and directed by Sathyan, the film narrates the story of a single mother (Vidyalakshmi) who refuses to let circumstances crush her spirit or her sense of adventure. Common sense and sense of humour – the hallmark of every Sathyan film – is evident in this film as well. For the veteran director believes that if one is endowed with the two, one cannot be down in the dumps for too long. And who should know the secret of success better than this director who is celebrating his golden jubilee as a filmmaker with his ‘Katha Thudarunnu.'
Gift for comedy
Right from his first directorial venture, ‘Kurukkante Kalyanam,' Sathyan's heroes and heroines are people next door. Unerringly, he tapped the gift for comedy in actors such as Sukumaran, Nedumudi Venu, Mammotty and Mohanlal to eulogise the common man and his world of joys and sorrows. Over the years, he has gifted viewers with some of the most memorable heroes and heroines in Malayalam cinema.“All of them are my favourites,” says Sathyan with a smile. “But,” he adds, “among them it is undoubtedly Balagopalan of ‘T. P. Balagopalan MA' and Kochu Tressia of ‘Manasinakkare.' Balagopalan is very dear to me. All my other characters, I feel, are his cousins and friends. Preman (played by Jayaram), my hero in ‘Katha Thudurunnu,' could be his younger brother,” says Sathyan.Looking back at his eventful filmography, Sathyan says what he treasures during his stint in Mollywood are certain priceless moments that came his way on account of his work in cinema. “I cherish the fact that I was able to work with such a fine actor as Mohanlal. There were moments during the filming when he blurred the line between reel and real life. One moment, he could be laughing and joking but the moment he stands before the camera, within seconds, he becomes the character,” says Sathyan.A trifle sentimentally, he says he treasures the fact that he could hear, work and see playback singer K.J. Yesudas sing. “That is not something filmmakers of tomorrow would be able to say,” says Sathyan, also an evocative lyricist whose songs have been sung by Yesudas.Another golden moment he holds close to his heart happened while they were recording the songs of ‘Rasanthantram.' “Much before I entered tinsel town, Ilayaraja was someone I idolised a great deal. The fact that I am able to work with him is something precious to me. While the recording for ‘Rasathantram' was going on, Kamal Hassan's ‘Vettaiyadu Vilayadu' was being shot in the vicinity. During a break in the shoot Kamal would join Ilayaraja in the room that he used for composing. I told Kamal that my heroine's name was Kanmani in the film as I was inspired by his song ‘Kanmani Anbodu Kadhalan' in ‘Guna.' Immediately, Kamal hummed the lines of the Ilayaraja song sung by Kamal himself in the film. Ilayaraja played it on the harmonium and Kamal sang along. I value such moments more than awards and hits,” says Sathyan.Not that he is a stranger to hits and awards. Many of his films (especially the ones written by Sreenivasan and Lohitadas) have become classics in Malayalam cinema, while the much quoted dialogues have become film lore and a part of the vocabulary of Malayalis. He remembers with a smile how during the discussions for ‘Sandesham,' Sreenivasan had assured him: ‘I don't know if the film will be a hit or not. But it will certainly have the best of dialogues.'“Kerala was going through a period of political vacuum and that is when we began discussions on the film. Both Sreenivasan and I knew we had a good subject but we were unsure how it would work out on the screen. Finally it was Lohitadas who gave us the confidence to go ahead.” But when both Lohitadas and Sreenivasan became engrossed in their own works, Sathyan began writing his own scripts. “Fortunately, writing has never been a new domain for me. But I still discuss my scripts with Sreenivasan and other friends. For instance, in ‘Katha….' there is a twist to the story that was advised by Sreenivasan. Similarly, it was Lohitadas who advised me to make Narain's character a bank manager in ‘Bhagyadevta,'” says Sathyan.However, he avers that it is essential for a filmmaker to have his ear to the ground to catch the rumblings of change that shapes a society in transition. The veteran feels that many of today's films seem to have lost that lifeline to reality, which is one of the most important reasons for the problems plaguing Malayalam cinema. “I make one film and watch films for the rest of the year to understand what is happening around us. I must be one of the few people who must have watched the most number of Malayalam films that were released last year,” says Sathyan, who continues to live in the village (Anthikkad) that he has put on the map of cinema.Perhaps that is how Sathyan gives us those perfect snapshots of life in the suburbs, complete with three-dimensional characters who live their roles on the screen. “I am one of them,” says Sathyan. “I make a film when I have something to say.”With ‘Katha Thudarunnu' the raconteur unveils another facet of life in Kerala.

277,Addressing love,Vijay George,2010-05-06,16:12:16 IST,"Oridathoru Postman
  | Photo Credit: special arrangement A modest but elegant house near Muttom in Thodupuzha, with waterfront views and greenery all around, makes for a rich frame for director Shaji Aziz's ‘Oridathoru Postman.' The film stars Kunchacko Boban, Innocent, Sarath Kumar, Kalabhavan Mani and Meera Nandan in the lead roles.“It's a serious A genuine story filled with humour, romance and sentiments,” says Shaji Aziz, who has earlier directed ‘Shakespeare MA (Malayalam)' with Shyju Anthikkad.“The story centres around the escapades of a father and son who live in this house. The father, Gangadharan (Innocent), is a postman in the village but not a very punctual one at that. He often fails to deliver letters and money orders on time and that is a cause of concern for all.“His long-suffering son, Reghunandanan (Kunchacko Boban), on the other hand, is a hardworking youth who teaches at a Public Service Commission examination coaching centre. He hopes to make it big but most of the money he earns from his salary, real estate and other businesses is barely enough to settle his father's bungles,” says the director.
Twist to the tale
“Reghunandanan often helps his father to deliver letters and comes across some letters that were left behind. He finds that the letters were addressed to one Yasin Mubarak and he decides to find him. The story takes a different turn once Raghunandanan sets off to find the addressee,” adds K. Gireesh Kumar, who has written the screenplay and dialogues of the film.Tamil actor Sarath Kumar, who has found great acceptance in Malayalam after his fine portrayal of Edachena Kunkan in the epic ‘Pazhassi Raja,' plays Yasin, a wildlife photographer. “Yasin is also an environmentalist. In fact, the sequences, which were shot earlier, had him requesting the villagers to keep their surroundings free from plastic waste, tobacco and so on. Presently we are shooting the scene where Yasin comes to meet Gangadharan,” says Sarath Kumar, while getting ready to face the camera.Meera Nandan plays Usha, a student at the coaching centre, who is in love with Reghunandanan, while Suraj Venjarammood, Salim Kumar and Jaffer Idukki, play “characters we would hope to come across in our villages” according to Gireesh Kumar.
Playing a cop
Kalabhavan Mani plays a cop, who despite talking and behaving in a comic way, is brilliant at his job and has a great track record.“The character is quite interesting and he presents himself initially in a comical way. I have really missed doing comedy for I love such roles.

278,My first break: Pyarelal,Rana Siddiqui Zaman,2010-05-06,15:58:10 IST,"Music Director Pyarelal
  
How it happened
Being from a musically driven family, I started arranging music at the age of 16. By 17, I became a composer. My father Pandit Ram Prasad Sharma, a trumpeter, taught me music and made me learn violin at the age of 12 from a Goan violinist. A famous director those days, who also gave a break to Kalyanji-Anandji was known to us. Once, I hesitatingly said to him, “You gave a chance to Kalyanji, give me one too.”He smiled and the next thing I knew was that I was to play the violin in the famous film “Haqeeqat” for which Madan Mohan composed music.The song was “Mein Ye Soch Uske Ghar Se Utha Tha.” He was so pleased with my performance that he came running and hugged me after the recording.
How it felt
At 17, it was thrilling and served as a great morale booster. In no time, he offered me “Parasmani”. That was in 1963. I couldn't believe my luck. Babubhai Mistry was a name to reckon with. No one would question his integrity. I and Laxmikant started working on the film. The film didn't do well but the music was a hit. It brought us close to known music directors like Naushad and Ravi and film producers like Tarachand Barjatya.
How life changed
The music of “Parasmani”, especially the song “Roshan Tumhi Se Duniya”, paved the way for us. The very next year director Satyen Bose gave us “Dosti”. It was Tarachandji's Rajshri Productions film. The film had new and young actors but its music was super hit. It got us our first FIlmfare Award in 1964. The most thrilling experience was that with “Dosti”, films like “Sangam” (music by Shankar-Jaikishan) and “Woh Kaun Thi” (Madan Mohan) were also nominated for the Filmfare Award.The award may have brought us fame, but unfortunately, it also created jealousy among our peers. Some of them canvassed against us and we stopped getting films. But we still got films from those who believed in us. Again from 1977 to 1980, we got the Filmfare Award consecutively for four years for “Amar Akbar Anthony” (1977), “Satyam Shivam Sundaram” (1978), “Sargam” (1979) and “Karz” (1980). In Ameen Sayani's “Binaca Geet Mala” our songs were regularly played among the top hits. Lata Mangeshkar made a great contribution to our success. She used to record 10 songs a month for other music directors, but for us she even sang 16 songs a month. Till date, I go to seek her advice in any music-related matter.Today, I miss Laxmikant, (he passed away in 1988) but I didn't stop making music. I have won friends like Jitendra, Dharmendra , Shashi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan in the film industry. Though I feel music has become quite technology-driven today, I always tell my students never to stop the use of acoustic instruments like flute, violin and sitar, for they are the basic ones. Today, there is even less poetry in songs. Dard-e-dil has become dard-e-disco. I and Laxmi did one good thing: We didn't take all films that came our way. We picked and chose even at the cost of sitting at home, unlike Shankar-Jaikishan. I still have lots of symphonies for kids that I wrote long ago, apart from western symphonies. I have few films today but I am happy that I haven't compromised with my kind of music.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/My-first-break-Pyarelal/article16298771.ece
279,Trying out a new turf,MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:25:34 IST,"A PRUDENT MAKE-OVER: Vikranth
  Whether Vikranth wishes it or not comparisons with his famous cousin have been inevitable. “It isn’t fair. Vijay Anna is innumerable notches higher. I’m just a beginner,” says Vikranth. Four films in four years and a solo hero in three of them, yet Vikranth has decided to toe the anti line in ‘Goripalayam,’ releasing today.“I’ve realized that to make up leeway I’ve got to be part of winning projects. And doing a negative role is a sure way of avoiding comparisons with my brother, because he’s never played villain,” he smiles.The young man has no problem admitting that he approached director Rasu Madhuravan for a chance to work with him. “I liked his ‘Maayaandi Kudumbathaar’ and called him up for an appointment. ‘I’ll get in touch with you myself,’ he said, and I thought it was another of those usual responses directors come up with.”But true to his word, Madhuravan contacted Vikranth and gave him ‘Goripalayam.’ “‘The film has 15 important characters and though yours has a negative slant, the scope it offers will be worthwhile,’ he told me. I make a late entry in the film but my character will make an impact,” he states with confidence. Those who have watched the film already have told him, “For the first time you don’t remind us of Vijay.” And wife Manasa who has been pulling his leg about his earlier roles, said, “You look nice in ‘Goripalayam.’” Vikranth and Manasa have known each other for long, and got married quite recently.Madhuravan has been so impressed with Vikranth’s show in ‘Goripalayam’ that he has booked him for his first production, ‘Vavvaal,’ to be directed by Bharatiraaja’s associate, So.Arulraj. Vikranth will also be working in Madhuravan’s next directorial venture.Criticisms about his earlier performances have singed the young actor. “I’ve been pained by comments,” he says. A debut film could make or irrevocably mar a hero’s career. ‘Karka Kasadara,’ his maiden attempt with Lakshmi Rai, wasn’t quite a judicious choice. “When I watched myself on screen I knew I had to start from scratch,” he concedes.Then came ‘Ninaithu Ninaithu Parthaen,’ again a non-starter. “But it had talented names Manikandan, Madhu Ambat, Joshua Sridhar …” defends Vikranth. Neither did ‘Nenjathai Killadhae’ in which he had ‘Ammuvaagiya Naan’ Bharathi as his pair work. “Directed by Agathiyan of ‘Kaadhal Kottai’ it is a film which I had pinned my hopes on,” he says.What did brother Vijay have to say about his performances? “He watched ‘Karka Kasadara’ and complimented me for my dances and stunts. ‘Work hard, talk little, turn a deaf ear to sycophancy and you’ll secure a safe niche in five years time,’ he advised. We meet often and discuss a lot of subjects but somehow, films haven’t been one of them.”Making it as a cricketer was Vikranth’s aim when in school and college. “In school Dinesh Karthik was my classmate and Badani my senior. Cricket, not acting, was the reigning passion then,” he says. Even today actors Arya, Jeeva, Ramesh, Ramana and Vikranth play regularly and participate in tournaments. The college team didn’t welcome the aspiring cricketer with open arms. Put off by the treatment meted out to him Vikranth gave up the game and began to concentrate on cinema.Like Vijay, Vikranth too began as a child actor. And again like Vijay who initially did ‘Senthoorapaandi’ with Vijayakanth to bolster up his career, Vikranth worked with the captain (Vijayakanth) in ‘Engal Aasan.’Getting back to ‘Goripalayam’ Vikranth says, Michael Rayappan, who is producing the film after the successful ‘Nadodigal,’ is immensely happy with the output. “He told Madhuravan, ‘You’ve done your job well. So my responsibility of taking it to the audience becomes greater now.’ For his part, Vikranth is keeping his fingers crossed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Trying-out-a-new-turf/article16298713.ece
280,Messiah off the mark,MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:23:14 IST,"ON USUAL LINES: Sura
  Adamantly adhering to the formula of a do-gooder’s one-man expedition against corruption, Vijay shows that he doesn’t intend to swerve even slightly from the path which he has trod on, in film after film. With ‘Sura’ (U) the capable crowd-puller follows the commercial pattern for the nth time in his career.Sura (Vijay) is the uncrowned prince of the fishermen’s colony, Yaazh Nagar. He offers succour to the people in his area and is looked upon as their saviour. Life goes on smoothly, till, of course, a Minister (Dev Gill) becomes too avaricious and all of a sudden wants to acquire the land on which the fishermen live.Vijay looks smarter than he did in his other recent films, his charming smile is intact, his poker-faced comedy has you in splits most of the time and his danger-courting stunts highlight his agility. Only when he overdoes things a little (like in the scene in court) does his performance lose appeal. So, if despite Vijay ‘Sura’ fails to sustain your interest it is the predictable story and the sagging screenplay that are to be blamed.Writer-director S.P. Raajakumar scores with his witty dialogue, though the fishermen’s gibberish about the greatness of the hero makes you want to scream. With MGR’s ‘Padagotti’ as the base Raajakumar has tried weaving a ‘modern’ yarn in a fishing settlement.A wealthy heroine falling for a poor fisherman is so outdated a premise that you don’t even find it funny anymore. The incongruity in the love affair between Sura (Vijay) and Purnima (Tamannaah) irritates.Vadivelu’s role of Umbrella is enjoyable whenever it melds with the main narration. Otherwise the track is just a time-wasting exercise.And what a let-down Tamannaah is, especially after her appealing chirpiness and pleasing screen presence in ‘Kandaen Kaadhalai’ and ‘Paiyya!’Ekambaram, the ace cameraman, who exquisitely captured the high seas that formed the backdrop of the story of ‘Iyarkkai,’ is in his elements once again in ‘Sura.’Zest marks Mani Sharma’s peppy numbers, and the pallavi of the opening song, ‘Vetri Kodi’ that portrays Vijay as a Messiah, is striking.A patient viewer can put up with a second love song, even when it hampers the flow of events. But by the time the lovers take off on their third duet he is down and out!Shooting an action sequence in the midst of a fleet of cars is fine, but why were two earth movers going this way and that like dinosaurs, in the background? Only the art director can explain the purpose!That it is his 50th film hasn’t come in his way of opting for the beaten track – so what if it is the half century mark and a milestone for an achiever, Vijay seems to ask.Predictable lines may have worked for one or two yesteryear heroes till the very end, but with changing tastes it is time Vijay begins to chalk out a different course. It isn’t dearth of talent, only an erroneous choice of roles. Come on Vijay, you can do it!",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Messiah-off-the-mark/article16298847.ece
281,"‘Raavanan’, a re-incarnation",MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:18:08 IST,"""In Hindi my presence has been kept under wraps as of now. I'm the proverbial dark horse, "" says Vikram about his role in the film 'Raavan'.
  | Photo Credit: g mail R
aavanan is almost ready and for Vikram it's another dream come true. “You know, I used to think one film each with Mani Ratnam and Shankar and I wouldn't mind retiring in that blaze of glory,” smiles Vikram. Always a picture of effervescence, mention Ratnam and his Raavanan (
Raavan in Hindi), and Vikram's energy level revs up further! He plays solid roles in both the Hindi and Tamil versions of the film — Raavanan is being dubbed in Telugu too. “Audiences in Andhra are bound to be floored by the subject,” Vikram's words ooze confidence.Interestingly, he isn't replicating the Tamil role in Hindi. “Here I'm Veera and in Hindi, Dev,” he smiles and on a serious note adds, “I hear that it's the first time in the world that an actor simultaneously plays two diametrically different roles in two languages of the same film.”
First straight Hindi film

Raavan isn't just Vikram's first project with Ratnam. It is also his first straight Hindi film. That he is being launched by the same reputed maker whom he yearned to work with sometime ago is a bonus! “You said it. Though Aparajith (
Anniyan dubbed in Hindi) didn't do too well, it's been telecast over 17 times so far. Yet Raavan is my first Hindi film,” he explains.Ratnam popped the question to Vikram just when they were about to begin shooting for Raavanan. “I think you can pull it off. Why not give it a shot?” he suggested. “Are you sure,” was Vikram's pithy response. Being in the habit of working on his physique and make-up to suit every part he portrays Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously. But locations were very remote and sets may not last for more than a month, he was told.So what did he do? “I've played little tricks with my body language and expressions and they should work,” he smiles cryptically. “I'm like a bull in one version — tough, rugged and a man who lives for the moment. In the other, my character is poetic, philosophical, fun loving… just about everything.”After the Hindi audio launch in Mumbai, the attention he got from the girls in particular was surprising. “I mean, after all these years…” he laughs gaily.Has he tried out a new look for Hindi? “Surely not the clean shaven look. I don't intend to look like other heroes. I've plumped for a close hair-cut and moustache. In Hindi my presence has been kept under wraps as of now. I'm the proverbial dark horse,” he chortles.Not many know that Vikram had earlier screen-tested for Mani Ratnam's Bombay. “But the wait has been worth it. Over the years, I've evolved as an actor. I feel in Raavan Mani has transcended his earlier achievements. The films should hit the bull's eye.”Working with Ratnam has been an engaging experience for Vikram. “He's open to your inputs. Raavanan And his energy is unbelievable. After a day's work, we would rehearse the scenes to be shot the next morning, costumes et al, before we dispersed. He would mull over them all night and be ready with the changes he wants.” ”Vikram can't stop talking about the films' locations. “We've shot entirely in India and you can't but say ‘Wow! We didn't know such beautiful places exist here.' We've gone to the unexplored plateaus of the Malshej Ghats, beyond Pune, and to the mist-covered Orccha near Jhansi where we saw clouds just sitting down on the roads through which we walked. Sameer Chanda's sets have blended so well with the milieu that you can't differentiate between the natural landscapes and those created.”They've also shot in the remote areas of Kolkata and the rarely-visited terrains on the other side of Chalakudi. “Manikandan and Santhosh Sivan have captured them so beautifully on camera,” comments Vikram.
Big ride to scenic spots
The unit was put up in an ashram of sorts on the hills, from where everyday they travelled for about an hour by car, then geared up for a 30-minute jeep ride after which they trekked another 15 minutes to reach the scenic spots!“AB (Abhishek Bachchan) and I have given our interpretations of the roles. But Raavan is more an AB film,” says Vikram. And about working with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, he simply says, “It was nice.”Now that his aspirations have been realised, what more could he want? “I've recorded a song for G.V. Prakash for Madrasapattinam along with MSV. And I'm waiting for a chance to sing for A.R. Rahman. I love his Raavanan compositions, especially ‘Veera' and ‘Usirae Pogudhae.' Also I want to turn director one day… so there's a lot more left to be done,” he guffaws.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/lsquoRaavananrsquo-a-re-incarnation/article16299040.ece
282,This joke's on you,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:57:33 IST,"The Sajids (producer Nadiadwala and director Khan) virtually declared war on film critics by setting a historic precedent. They not just refused to have a press screening for reviewers but also went on record giving reasons for their decision — nature of the film's genre, effect of premature criticism on its business, advent of Twitter fuelling word-of-mouth bad reviews, etc.Once you watch Housefull, you realise that's what any smart filmmaker would do. No sarcasm there. Seriously, Housefull is an inspired escapist, borderline plagiarised, no-holds-barred, silly slapstick comedy that does not even pretend to have a plot, let alone logic or plausibility.Many of the jokes are forced in, the filmmaker trying to milk the ridiculousness of situational comedy for as many laughs as possible per minute even if it means letting characters slap each other for no reason at all.While critics revel in taking on films like these and more so, given the public display of arrogance, reviewers seem to have ridiculed the film for all the wrong reasons. Housefull has got plenty of flak for being a crude, sexist, offensive comedy. Like that's a bad thing.Though comedies such as American Pie, Dumb and Dumber, Road Trip and The Hangover have been celebrated as cult classics, the genre still remains in the domain of low-brow entertainment and filmmakers attempting it here are the favourite whipping boys of critics. Most of it has to do with plagiarised plots, situations and even lines, though the makers in some cases have gone ahead and acquired the rights to remake the film (while continuing to take credit for Story, Screenplay and Dialogues).
Housefull is a classic case study of factors plaguing comedy in India, despite the emergence of Judd Apatow's unapologetically offensive films as a legitimate sub-genre.So if these overtly sexist films are accepted and embraced by men and even women of late at an International level, why can't we laugh when Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh decide to do a Ben Stiller gag?Here's why. Originality factors apart, these adaptations are just not funny enough. While Housefull provides a considerable number of laughs in the second half, there are also a considerable number of jokes that fall flat all through the film.Within the film's first few minutes, we learn that Akshay Kumar plays a loser who brings bad luck to all around him and hence, is employed by a Casino that wants to make sure all their clients lose their money. If you are wondering how the Casino remains unaffected by his bad luck, you ought to get out of that movie hall when you still can. This is not your kind of film.The loser then decides to stay at his best buddy's place in London only to get married to the wrong girl (who does a Heartbreak Kid on him during their honeymoon in Italy) and falls in love with another girl (while Forgetting his Sarah Marshall) and in the second half of the film, needs to Meet The Parents… Or the Brother in this case, who is the same suspicious brother borrowed from Right Bed, Wrong Husband (last adapted in Ajay Devgn's All The Best). The makers also find time to recycle gay jokes from Kal Ho Na Ho and Dostana.Yes, the guys are cool and the women are totally hot when they are prancing around in bikinis. But with barely an original bone in its skeletal story outline, Housefull at best works in bits and starts as a series of inspired gags — many forced and a few spontaneous. Hate it as much as you want but you will find it impossible to stifle a laugh.Watch it only if you are forgiving and don't mind junk food for the thoughtless.

283,Reason to cheer,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:55:43 IST,"Trust good old Clint Eastwood to craft a film that transcends the spirit of sport with its political layering without compromising on the integrity of a riveting sports film or the reputation of a celebrated leader of a nation while focussing on one of the lesser-known aspects of his personality.Mandela's interest in the game was not just a political move but a “human calculation,” as the newly elected President (Morgan Freeman lends a lot of grace and dignity to Mandela) insists, quite early on.The docudrama begins with Mandela's first day on the job as the new President. “He can win an election but can he run a country,” asks the front page of a daily as he goes for his early morning walk, with just two security guards for company.Eastwood loses no time at all to introduce us to the security risks, and the sub-plot with his security aides keeps the drama alive (the moment with the plane over the stadium is a heart-stopper) when the sport portions of the film are yet to take off.Though based on the book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation, the filmmaker takes some cinematic licence to replace Mandela's source of inspiration. Apparently, Mandela in reality had given the rugby captain Pienaar an extract from Theodore Roosevelt's speech that inspired him and not the poem Invictus written by William Ernest Henley.
Invictus is the story of a President who decides to channel the country's passion for sport as a unifying force to blur racial differences by deciding to back the dominantly white Springboks team when the rest of the Sports Ministry is baying for the blood of the players and stepping up the pressure to change the name of the team.But it's also the story of the other leader, the rugby captain Pienaar (Matt Damon's on a roll — The Green Zone and now, Invictus) who has to motivate the team and back the lone-black player in the team and see the team through its rough patch and strive for the kind of glory they hadn't even imagined.Eastwood's genius lies in making us see how the challenges both these leaders face were not too different and the solutions weren't too different either.Between Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, the actors have oodles of charisma to charm the audience and they turn in a sincere, natural portrayal, backed with some crisp writing (Anthony Peckham).It helps that Eastwood resists the urge to hero-worship the President and treats him like an ordinary dutiful old man, who despite his superhuman faith in humanity, is a vulnerable workaholic with a miserable domestic life.This sort of sensitivity and balance is what makes Eastwood the master filmmaker that he is and that's exactly what makes Invictus transcend the sport film genre and keeps us hooked till the very end despite the predictability of the format.A truly inspiring and uplifting sports film guaranteed to make you feel good.
Genre: Drama
Director: Clint Eastwood
Cast: Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, Tony Kgoroge
Storyline: Two leaders, Nelson Mandela and Pienaar, the captain of his rugby team, need to inspire a country and the team by setting an example and leading from the front.

Kutti Pisasu' starts off with ‘Amman' specialist Ramya Krishnan reprising the role of yet another village protector, this time as Kenathadi Kali. Once her prowess is established through two sequences, including one where screen scorcher Nasser is reduced to a pale shadow of himself, it's time to move on to 200 years later.Priya (Keethika), a precocious child, the daughter of Ramjhi and Sangeetha, gyrates to adult steps and draws like a dream, coming up with a visual of an ancient yellow car. Soon, she is possessed by the spirit of a girl called Savithri (a terribly out-of-sorts-and-shape Kaveri — whatever happened to the cute actor?).Cut to flashback mode, and the stories of Savithri, her brother, Karuppu (Ganja Karuppu) and their adored yellow car (washed only with warm water, mind you!). Savithri is cheated by her fiancé Nanjappan (Riyaz Khan), and given as sacrifice by his sorcerer friend Mandiramoorthy. Her brother also dies in the process of saving her. His spirit is locked in the yellow car, till Kenathadi Kali frees him to avenge his sister's death. Two of Nanjappan's friends are killed by the possessed child — one in the harbour and another in the circus ring — and, he's next in line. Enter a miniature villian (Mandiramoorthy's guru) mouthing “Jakkamma” ever so often, and the stage is set for a lopsided fight, not-so special effects and all.Finally, evil is vanquished, but not before you are forced to sit through some more songs where your heart bleeds for the child artiste, who seems to have little else to do other than look startled, angry and roll her eyes, all this in the midst of bad lip-sync.Ramjhi and Sangeetha have little to do except perform pujas, make thayir saadham, and cry about their daughter's fate. And, Delhi Ganesh plays the grandfather who loves ftv. Ouch!There's little to say in terms of story or production value. Strange, considering director Rama. Narayanan is a veteran in children's and godly movies, even if they are terribly over-the-top! As for the music, Deva's brief seems to have been to come up with such high-decibel dabbankuthu that even the Transformers-look-alike dances.

The big move
Director Vijaya Varman's Biriyani, an emotional drama of the plight of a young domestic help, has won teenage actor Poo Myli, the ‘Best Actress' award at the Short Film Festival of Los Angeles. The film, based on Subhalakshmi Narayanan's short story, and with music by Mohan Narayanan, has been Varman's stepping stone into films. He now directs a full-length Tamil film, Ninaivodu Vilayadu, starring Master Mahendran and Nandana. The music is by Swar Mogi, while Varman has written the story, screenplay and dialogues.”
Recreating a hit
Twenty-seven years ago, Thyagarajan acted with Sarita, Silk Smita and Jayamalini in the huge hit Malayoor Mambattiyan, which was remade in Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Now, he has cast his son Prashanth in the new version of the film, titled Mambattiyan, with Meera Jasmine and Mumaith Khan for company.Will the new film re-create the magic of the original? With Prakash Raj and Vadivelu in key roles, the theme should work with present-day audiences, we think.
Getting real
Tiruvannamalai's 10-day Brahmotsavam, where more than 15 lakh devotees throng the town, forms a major part of the A.G. Raja-produced , Ivar. Directed by N. Priyan, the film was initially meant to be Raja's directorial venture. “Since I was introducing four new actors as the main leads, I felt that someone as talented as Priyan should also be given a chance to prove his talent. And, he has done a wonderful job,” says Raja.The film revolves around four youngsters who are interested only in the present. Since the film focusses on the men, the songs feature male voices too. Also, there are no choreographed dances or ‘contrived' fight sequences, says the producer. “There's a dance, but an impromptu one that happens in a TASMAC bar,” he adds.
Novel attempt
Director Keera's Pacchai Engira Kaathu is the story of 27-year-old Pacchai Ramkumar, narrated from the point of view of seven individuals. Based on a real-life incident, Keera's movie is about the life of youth who blindly support politicians and parties. Newcomer Vasagar plays the hero, while another new face Devathai plays his love interest. Says Keera: “The story is narrated in flashback mode by four persons at the time of the hero's unlikely death. As the film progresses, two more persons join the narration, including the heroine's sister. Finally, I, the director, complete the story.”

he svelte Shilpa Shetty judged the first season of ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa', the second season of ‘Bigg Boss' on Colors and will now be judging the second season of the war-of-the-genders dance competition, ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' on Star Plus. The actor on judging celebrities and why television works for her.
You have only two films — “The Man” and “Desire” lined up. Are you gradually bidding goodbye to films?
Sunny Deol's “The Man” has been stalled. I shot for “Desire” six months ago, but there is still some work left. I really wanted to take a break… I have been working continuously for the last 18 years. I have so much happening that I just do not have the time.
Meanwhile, it seems you have taken a liking to television — after ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa' and ‘Bigg Boss', it is ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha now.
Television works well for me because it does not take too much of my time, the audience sees me and I enjoy the chance to say my bit in front of people. So I always try to do something different on TV every year. ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance show and is obviously different from ‘Bigg Boss' in which I was a host. And though I have been a judge before, this is a new format.
But there doesn't seem to be any significant difference in the show's format — it will be the same girls versus boys competition.
The difference would be us — the new set of judges. The show is being aired on Star Plus and so more money has been spent on the production, packaging, costumes this time around.
Being a dancer yourself, do you get impatient or irritated when untrained celebrities perform badly on a platform such as likethis?
‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance-oriented show and I know a bit of dance, so my job is a little easy. All the participating celebrities are good dancers — we have sifted out the bad ones.
Does the at fact that you will be judging ‘TV celebrities' make it difficult for you to criticise them?
All the participants know that they will be judged; and that we are here to judge them. We are not here to pinpoint who is a bad dancer and who is better. We are here to see who performs better on a particular day.
Will the jury be biased towards the girls because it consists of two women — Vaibhavi Merchant and you — while Arshad Warsi is the only mansole male?
As judges, we have to forget the gender we belong to and have an unbiased opinion. I will try my best to do that.
Is there any particular dance form which you are still not confident about?
I'm not very good with locking and popping. I'm so glad it has come in recently; and not in my time (
laughs). I don't think my body is meant for that kind of dance form; my arms are very long. I just love the way these new kids do this dance. I'm amazed by the talent we have in our country. I'm a Bharatnatyam dancer but for “Desire” I had to learn Odissi and it was difficult, inspite of being a dancer.
Who are your favourite dancers from the industry?
I think Rishi Kapoor was a phenomenal dancer. He never missed a single beat. See his songs. I'm sure the choreographer never ever told him to do the step a particular way. He was superb … what synchronisation!
We saw husband Raj Kundra by your side throughout the IPL. Any chances of him making an appearance on this show?
Star Plus cannot afford him. They still do not have that kind of money.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Reality-bytes/article16298702.ece

  The master story teller is back to making a socio-romantic musical entertainer after a gap of five years. Veteran filmmaker K. Raghavendra Rao is making his 105th celluloid statement, Jhummandhinaadham with a theme that largely harps on our rich traditional music and heritage, according to producer Lakshmi Prasanna. Starring her brother Manoj Kumar Manchu and debutante Tapsi in the lead with her father Mohan Babu playing a pivotal character.At the Ramoji Film City, the atmosphere is one of celebration. A celebration showcasing unity and patriotism, capsuled into a song written by Chandra Bose and composed by Maragatha Mani Keeravani. Raghavendra Rao usually does the preliminary designing of the song sequence, making the job of the choreographer easy.Choreographer Suchitra Chandra Bose in consultation with the master craftsman is guiding the actors to perform that includes apart from the lead pair and Mohan Babu, Suman, Brahmanandam, M.S. Narayana, Pragathi, Aishwarya and others.
Desamante Matham kadhu… the song is played on the nagara and lensman S. Gopala Reddy captures the emotions of the actors. Desamante Manushuloy the song continues as the next block is taken for filming. It reminds you of the song, Punyabhoomi Naa Desam Namo Namaami from Major Chandrakanth in which the legendary N.T. Rama Rao played the title role. Keeravani is at his best one more time, you agree as you listen to the song.“It is a musical story with nine songs,” informs Lakshmi Prasanna. “A lot of research has gone into the making of these songs and the story. We are forgetting our traditional songs. How many of us know today that once during marriage ceremonies, songs recalling the family tree and roots of the bride/bridegroom are sung as the marriage parties reach each other's house. It is like nostalgia to the older generation and introduction of our rich traditional heritage to the young audience.”A wide variety of musical bonanza- from folk, lullaby, devotional, patriotic to fusion music awaits the discerning cine goers. “There is a competition song filmed on dad (Mohan Babu) and Manoj on the lines of the one that was shot on Nagesh and dad in Allari Mogudu,” says Lakshmi Prasanna.The camera now focuses on Manoj and Mohan Babu as they place their steps to Keeravani's tune. “This is the first time dad is playing a full length role in a Manoj film,” says the happy producer. “This movie presents Manoj in a different light, as a soft looking guy. In looks and acting it is a complete makeover from his earlier movies,” says the proud sister. Manoj has that certain ease in his acting be it in action, comedy or emoting.The conversation shifts to Tapsi, the newcomer to Telugu cinema. “ She plays a girl from the U.S. who is on a research work on Telugu traditions, music and culture. Manoj acts as her guide and the journey begins,” she smiles. The journey takes the audience on a roller coaster ride of entertainment laced with a gamut of emotions, wit, humour and a medley of music as the title indicates.“After this song, we have a four day talkie part to finish before flying to South Korea to film the remaining song on the lead pair,” signs off Lakshmi. The film is slated for release in June.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Family-ties-call-the-shots/article16298699.ece
288,Bale Piaa!,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:30:05 IST,"Very few actors here come without strings attached. Especially, the watchful eye of mom or dad on the sets. Piaa Bajpai of Goa fame is one of those rare actors who does it all by herself.As her film Bale Pandiya, directed by Siddharth Chandrashekar, readies for release (the audio launch happened recently), Piaa talks about her journey that began here with the Khosla Ka Ghosla remake, Poi Solla Porom, and continues with the K.V. Anand film Ko, to be out in August.
How it started
But, her journey to showbiz started five years ago when the girl from Uttar Pradesh left home for Delhi after doing a diploma in computer science.“I wanted to prove to my parents that I could live by myself. Giving tuitions was good business in Delhi back then. You could make up to Rs. 1,500 a kid. So if you took tuition for seven to eight kids, you could make good money. I also worked as a receptionist.“After a year, I got tired of going to office, coming back and doing nothing else. For a year, I had not taken money from my parents. Then, they grew confident about me, and I shifted to Mumbai,” she recalls.
Dubbing for serials
Piaa started dubbing for TV serials. “Since I was from U.P., my Hindi was good. I could make Rs. 250 - Rs. 300 doing just one session. Then, I started getting offers only for dubbing. When you want to see yourself on screen, but are dubbing instead for someone else, it's very depressing. So, I decided to stop dubbing, and started doing print ads, then commercials and music videos.”The auditions led to a commercial directed by Priyadarshan. “I was very apprehensive about working in the South because I didn't know anyone here. But, when Priyadarshan Sir asks you if you want to audition for a Tamil film, how can you not do it? I lied to him that Tamil wouldn't be a problem,” she laughs.“They auditioned me in English and Hindi and the Tamil audition came much later.”Now that she has shot for a few Tamil films (
Poi Solla Porom, Aegan, Goa, Bale Pandiya and Ko), Piaa understands the language better. “I write my lines in English-Hindi and memorise them, and the director tells me how to emote.”“In Bale Pandiya, I play a happy girl living with her grandfather. She falls in love with a boy who thinks he's a loser. We shot for three to four months. It's a good role,” she says, narrating an anecdote about how she fought sea-sickness with cans of tamarind. “We were shooting on a yacht, and I wasn't used to the sea.”Shooting by the beaches and partying in Goa for Venkat Prabhu's Goa, and now sailing. What a difficult life for an actor!“It's not like that. You have to shoot when you are not well. Sometimes, in the hot sun… you have to sing, dance, smile, not be tense, or look tired. No matter what's going on in your mind, it should not show on your face. It gets tough for me sometimes, because, when I am upset, it shows on my face.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Bale-Piaa/article11639885.ece
289,My First Break: Dhyana,S.R. Ashok Kumar,2010-05-06,14:25:54 IST,"I learnt Bharatanatyam at a tender age. When I finished my masters in Bio-technology, I got a chance to act in a film by popular director Logidas. Unfortunately, it did not materialise. So when Meera Kathiravan, his associate, asked me to act in his film, I didn't evince much interest. Moreover, it was not the role of the heroine. But the director succeeded in convincing me and the film was Aval Peyar Thamizharasi.It was exciting to see myself on the screen. I watched the film in a theatre in Tenkasi where I had been on a holiday. To my surprise, people recognised me and some even came forward to talk to me. They wished that I should appear on screen more often.After my debut, people recognise me wherever I go. Except that nothing much has changed. Acting is a passion for me. I would like to do more powerful roles and make a mark in the industry. I did not do any other film for nearly a year as I was waiting for a good break. Virunthali is a good film produced by Rajesh Gopinath for Gopika International and directed by Whaterman. This is my second film and I am awaiting its release — I am sure it will be a box office success.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/My-First-Break-Dhyana/article16298693.ece

Akshay plays monkey!
With hi-definition technology being the order of the day, Housefull producer Nadiadwala Grandson has tied up with Hungama Digital Media and launched a digital promotion campaign for the multi-starrer. An online game application has been devised on the Akshay-monkey slapping episode from the film. The player can choose to be either the ape or Akshay and the objective of the game is to slap the other person harder.When we asked Akshay to make a choice, he jested, “I'd rather be a monkey as his reflexes are stronger.” When it was Deepika's turn to answer, she spontaneously replied, “I'd always be Akshay because I could never hit him.”
No Ranbir for now
There has been much talk in tinseltown about Ranbir-Deepika's on-off relationship, not just onscreen but off screen as well. Last seen together in Bachna Ae Haseeno, there was a buzz about Deepika signing her next film opposite the young Kapoor.When queried about it at an event, she curtly said, “When I sign, I'll let you know.”
Humour to the rescue
Sajid Khan, director of Housefull, is making a tall claim. He brags that Akshay's comic timing in his film will remind the audience of the peerless comedy king, Kishore Kumar, especially in his scenes with Riteish.The proof of the pudding lies in the eating. And Akshay amply provided the proof when he bailed Sajid out. Some time back, Manoj Kumar was miffed with Sajid and had said that flinging mud at others only makes the person who is flinging the mud, dirty. At the Housefull event, a contrived Sajid responded to Manoj's comment with, “Manoj Kumar is a veteran and I will never make fun of him. If he thinks I am mud, then so be it.”Akshay instantly quipped, “After all, a lotus can grow only in mud,” and made an otherwise sheepish Sajid grin from ear to ear.
Archana's role
Ask Badmaash Company director what his wife Archana Puran Singh's contribution to his film was and the hunky Punjabi actor-turned-director says: “When I took a break for this film, she became the husband as well as the wife. She took care of the finances which took most of the burden off my head. Finances are something that can kill a man; and this was why I couldn't become a director earlier. I was trying to fulfil my duties as breadwinner, husband and father. Finally, when I decided I needed to do something for myself and live my dream for once, she said ‘Go fulfil your dream'. I'm very fortunate I have a wife like her.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Mumbai-Express/article16298688.ece

293,Blast from the past - Bhooloka Rambai (1940),RANDOR GUY,2010-05-06,14:11:29 IST,"A SUCCESS STORY: Bhooloka Rambai
  
K.L.V. Vasantha, T.K. Shanmugham, T.R. Mahalingam, T.S. Balaiah, N.S. Krishnan, T.A. Mathuram and Kumari Rukmini
K.L.V. Vasantha was one of the popular heroines of early Tamil cinema. Slim and attractive, she could also sing well. She made her debut in Sri Kanda Leela (1938), a Premier Cinetone, Coimbatore production, directed by noted filmmaker H.S. Mehta, and written by well-known writer L. Nanjappa Chettiar, one of the directors of the production company and studio.Vasantha hit big time in 1939 when she played the title role in Rambayin Kaathal, directed by noted filmmaker B.N. Rao. Critics remarked that the celestial beauty of Lord Indra's court, Rambha, would have looked like Vasantha!Following the success of Rambayin Kaathal, Vasantha was cast in Bhooloka Rambai. A folktale with many twists and turns, it's about a prince (Shanmugham) falling in love with Bhooloka Rambha (Vasantha), their secret marriage, getting a child to be sacrificed, and later saved by Divine Grace… His friend (Mahalingam) travels with him; they meet birds that talk and predict their future. Again directed by Rao, the film was produced by M. Somasundaram (Jupiter Somu) and M.D. Viswanathan under the banner of Salem Shanmugha Films and Vijaya Maruthi Pictures at Central Studios, Coimbatore. During the making of the film, the producers ran into financial problems and work halted for sometime. Around this time, the later day Indian movie mogul S.S. Vasan had just entered as a distributor with his Gemini Pictures Circuit (GPC) and was looking for movies for distribution. He called on Rao at Coimbatore and asked him whether he could complete the film in time for Deepavali if he funded the project. He also told him he was in the process of acquiring a studio in Madras, and promised Rao that he would be the director of his first production. Vasan who never went back on his word engaged Rao for the first Gemini Studios production Madanakamarajan (1941) which somewhat interestingly had much common ground in Bhooloka Rambai (both were written by well-known writer and playwright B.S. Ramaiah.)
Bhooloka Rambai proved a success and Vasantha's popularity grew by a few more notches. Besides being cast as the heroine in Madanakamarajan, Vasan cast her as ‘Chandralekha' in his mammoth movie. However, for many reasons, Vasantha opted out, and T. R. Rajakumari came on board to create movie history.In those days, Tamil films were screened all over South India without any dubbing or subtitles, and people watched them with interest. To give them an indication of the storyline, producers invariably had an English title for each of the Tamil film. For example, Gumasthavin Penn had the title, Clerk's Daughter!For the same reason, the name of this film in English was given in posters as Bhooloka Rambha and not ‘Rambai' as in Tamil. B.N. Rao told this writer years later that the name of the celestial dancer was Rambha and not Rambai!As usual, the N. S. Krishnan-T.A. Mathuram pair took care of the comedy and sang a couple of duets in their own inimitable style.
Remembered for: the interesting storyline, gripping on-screen narration, the impressive presence and performance of Vasantha, and the comedy of Krishnan-Mathuram.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Blast-from-the-past-Bhooloka-Rambai-1940/article16298691.ece

  Director Hari has reasons to cheer, as his impending Suriya-starrer Singam will have its audio launched on May 11. Taut screenplay and climactic surprises will be the crowd-pulling factor of the film and the film is set to create waves, he said.The film also marks the 10th project of the director and 25th film for Suriya. The director said the second half would stir considerable curiosity among the audience and has all the ingredients of a racy entertainer.Suriya dons the role of a police officer in the film, pairing up with Anoushka. Hari has a signature style of setting his films in lush countryside and this film will be no different. The story is based in Thoothukudi and nearby villages, with some portions shot around Chennai. Suriya has got a makeover and would sport a new look as a police officer, with a stylish moustache. “His film Kaakha Kaakha is still quite popular with Tamil audience. It was tricky for me to pull out Suriya off that image. I created this character as a personality that is a contrast to the role of ‘Anbuchelvan',” he told The Hindu recently.The film will have a lot of action sequences and a good amount of hilarity, with Vivek handling the comedy track. Hari promises that the movie will have logical sequences and everyday issues are narrated in cinematic language. The director does not brook comparisons with filmmakers scripting off-beat movies. “They are doing an excellent job and taking Tamil cinema to the next step. But the industry also needs some dose of commercial element. I have no intentions to attempt such different storylines. Commercial movies are my forte.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Hari-hopeful-of-Singams-roaring-success/article16303871.ece

  With prices of essential commodities cooling a tad on arrival of rabi crops, food inflation softened further to 16.04 per cent for the week ended April 24 from 16.61 per cent in the previous week.Even as the general expectation is that a normal monsoon, if as projected by the India Meteorological Department comes true, would help in easing food prices further, fuel inflation held steady at 12.69 per cent owing to higher prices following the hike in duties on petrol and diesel.Significantly, despite persistent demands by the Opposition earlier this week for rolling back the hike in fuel prices, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee held firm and expressed his inability to do so owing to the fragile fiscal situation.The gradual decline in food inflation for the second week in a row has raised hopes of some moderation in the overall inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for April from the March level of 9.9 per cent. The headline WPI inflation data for April is expected to be released next week.According to Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu, the headline inflation is likely to soften to 6-7 per cent in the coming months. “I expect the overall WPI to come down to 6-7 per cent in the next three months,” he said.However, despite the declining trend in recent weeks, food inflation has remained above 15 per cent since November last year. Keeping this mind, the United Nations' organisation ESCAP has expressed concern over the food price spiral even as it projected a cool-down during the year.During the week, inflation eased on account of lower prices of fish, wheat, fruits and vegetables which declined by one per cent each. However, the prices of tea went up by 13 per cent while gram, maize and eggs were also dearer by one per cent each.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Food-inflation-softens/article16298862.ece

  As board examinations slowly fade into memory and students prepare for their results, the season of obtaining application forms for various courses has begun.Most government and self-financing institutions have started issuing application forms for admission into professional as well as arts and science courses. But, with intense competition pushing students to have multiple backup options, application fee collected along with the forms seems to have become a revenue-generating option for colleges, say parents and students.G. Abdul Haseeb, a parent, says “Some professional colleges give 15-page application forms with pictures of the college library and canteen printed on glossy paper. As a result, they charge exorbitant amount as application fee.”He says that it especially affects students in the 60-to-75 percentile category who might want to keep options open and end up applying to many colleges. “Some kind of regulation is needed and a uniform application fee regime must be brought in.”K.Ramnath, awaiting his class XII results, says “My parents wanted me to apply to many courses. I have already spent more than Rs.2,000 on application forms. I will also be applying for law and a couple of bachelors programmes.”Students also say that if one applies for two or more courses in some colleges, a separate fee has to be paid each time. The application cost of popular courses such as B.Sc Visual Communication is twice that of a B.Com course in the same college.S.Narasimhan, principal, DG Vaishnav College, which is an aided institution, says that irrespective of the number of courses in a college, there must be only one application form. “Students can give their course preference in a single form. Government guidelines also clearly state that colleges must give out applications only after the Class XII results are announced. Students have to be given the chance to make an informed choice.” Higher Education Secretary, K. Ganesan, said that there was no reason for one college to have multiple forms. “Instructions will be issued to all colleges in this regard immediately.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/lsquoApplication-form-season-on/article16298633.ece
300,No words to explain the exceptional depravity: Judge,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,23:58:57 IST,"The “brutality” of offences committed by Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab, the “depravity” of his mind and his “voluntary” act of becoming a terrorist as per the prosecution's case formed the basis for awarding the death sentence to the lone surviving attacker of 26/11.The special sessions court in its reasoning for the sentence stated: “There is no evidence of mental or emotional disturbance. On the contrary, he [Kasab] appeared to be mentally prepared. The court has taken note that this man [Kasab] voluntarily went to the office of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. No leader took him there. He along with his friend Muzaffar went from place to place without being accompanied by anybody [from Lashkar]. He [Kasab] offered to become a mujahid. He was prepared to face all kinds of training. He refused the option of returning to his relatives' place and preferred to [remain at the training camp]. There is no chance of reformation or rehabilitation of such a person. The way he has committed the offence gives the court no scope for considering his reformation or rehabilitation.”The court rejected the defence argument of moral justification for Kasab's crimes as it found it to be “frivolous.” It also rejected defence lawyer K.P. Pawar's contention that his client was acting under duress and domination of the Lashkar bosses.“Where is the duress,” the court asked. “He and Muzaffar knocked on the door of the Lashkar office. He has shown no duress or domination. Instead, the delay in the attack [upset] him. He was anxious to attack India. He asked the wanted accused [of Lashkar] why there was a delay.”The criterion of young age was rejected by the court in the light of “the aggravating factors as argued by Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam on behalf of the State.”“The murders were committed after previous planning. Not only was there previous planning, but meticulous and systematic planning with all the modern equipment available. All possible precautions were taken to see to it that the attack was a success. The court has accepted Mr. Nikam's argument,” judge M.L. Tahaliyani said.In agreement with the prosecution's argument of unimaginable brutality, the court noted, “[The memory of] brutality was writ large on the faces of the witnesses. When you read the evidence of witnesses at CST [Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus], see the photographs of [photographer] Sebastian D'Souza, I don't think any words are required to describe the brutality. Some witnesses were not even ready to be police witnesses although having seen the incident, and some were not ready to come to court although their statement had been recorded by the police.”Commenting on the incident, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “There are no words to explain the exceptional depravity seen in the initial stages of commission of offence. When he fired indiscriminately, it was without any regard; children and women were killed.”The court also took into consideration that police officers and public servants were “assaulted, injured and killed” by Kasab and his associates.Having listed the observations, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “It is difficult for me to prepare a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The balance is totally in favour of the prosecution.”The court took into account the observations made by the Supreme Court in Bacchan Singh vs. State of Punjab, 1980. However, it noted that the nature of crimes committed by Kasab and the other attackers were not in the sight of the apex court. “The facts of this case are very different. The circumstances are so aggravating that it is impossible to mitigate any of the circumstances.”The judge also drew upon the principles of jurisprudence by jurist Salmond: “To enjoy an effective system of law we have to impose a penalty which [befits] the crime committed by the accused.” Referring to the case of Ankush Maruti vs. State of Maharashtra, he said, “Undue sympathy to give less penalty will do more harm to the justice system.” With reference to the case of Dhananjay Chatterjee alias Dhana vs. State of West Bengal, the court observed the rights of people at large need also to be considered along with the rights of the convict.Mr. Nikam expressed his happiness for the verdict before the media. “Today we have been successful in giving justice to the victims of 26/11 and the departed souls. I also feel relieved on being discharged from Arthur Road jail. We did not fall for the foul games Kasab was trying to play. I think the Crime Branch officers, they deserve all the praise.”Kasab's lawyer on the other hand said he was satisfied with the work he had done. “It was very difficult for me to defend; the evidence was voluminous. I did my job successfully and the court appreciated my efforts. The way I placed my case was the most important thing for me. I could find many good points. It's the court's jurisdiction whether to accept or reject the arguments. I am satisfied with my endeavours,” he said.The court sentenced Kasab to life imprisonment for offences committed under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 307 (attempt to murder), 307 read with 109 (abetment) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 364 (kidnapping or abducting), 121 A (conspiracy to wage war), 122 (collecting arms with the intention of waging war), and Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/No-words-to-explain-the-exceptional-depravity-Judge/article16298877.ece

302,Kasab sentenced to death,Rahi Gaikwad,2010-05-06,23:08:13 IST,"Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab “shall be hanged by neck till he is dead.”Pronouncing these words, the Special Sessions Court here on Thursday sentenced to death the lone surviving gunman of the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.Kasab was given the death penalty on five counts: murder, abetment to murder, waging war, criminal conspiracy and committing terrorist acts.He was also awarded life imprisonment on five counts: attempt to murder in furtherance of a common intention, kidnapping and abducting in order to murder, conspiracy to wage war, collecting arms with the intention of waging war and causing explosion thus endangering life and property.‘
Aapko char offences ke liye sazaye maut di jaati hai. [You have been sentenced to death for four offences],' Judge M.L. Tahaliyani told Kasab after he read out the order.“You have been given the death penalty for murdering Indian citizens, police officers, conspiring with Lashkar leaders and committing terrorist acts. The court has said while giving the judgment that you shall be hanged unto death,” Mr. Tahaliyani told Kasab. While the sentence was being read out, Kasab sat still, his face sunk deep in the cup of his palm. He listlessly waved when asked by the court to give an opinion on his sentencing. Anxiety drew him to ask for water and he had to be taken out of court. “
Shukriya saab [Thank you, sir],” was all the 26/11 convict could say on his way out of the courtroom.The court wholly accepted the prosecution's arguments for awarding the death sentence, noting that the “aggravating circumstances” fully outweighed the “mitigating circumstances.” It found that the defence could not make out a case for the lesser punishment of life.“In my opinion, the circumstances demand that death penalty be imposed in this case. The court has no option but to impose death sentence. This man has lost the right of getting humanitarian treatment,” the court observed.The court also referred to the Kandahar hijack incident triggered by the presence of the accused in the custody of the Government of India. Mr. Tahaliyani noted, “By keeping such a person alive there would always be a danger hanging over the government. He is a constant danger. He is a menace to society. He has no right to live.”The Indian Penal Code Sections under which Kasab has been given death penalty are: 302 (murder), 302 read with 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war), 302 read with 34 (common intention) and 302 read with 109 (abetment) read with 120 B.In addition, he has been given death for the offence punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. For the other offences, he was awarded rigorous imprisonment, simple imprisonment and imposed with fines.Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told reporters that a confirmation of the death penalty from the Bombay High Court was awaited. Kasab would continue to be housed at the high security Arthur Road jail till further orders by the government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Kasab-sentenced-to-death/article13797884.ece

Krishna, with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi during SAARC summit in Thimpu. Krishna told the Rajya Sabha that he will call up Qureshi on Friday to discuss bilateral ties.
  Setting the ball rolling for the resumption of dialogue with Islamabad, Minister for External Affairs S.M. Krishna on Thursday announced that he would speak to his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi soon after the end of the Parliament session on Friday.Mr. Krishna is expected to discuss the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Qureshi as well as between the two Foreign Secretaries. These interactions were agreed upon by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani in Thimphu last week to address the trust deficit between the two countries. Subsequently the two Foreign Ministers agreed to get in touch after the end of the ongoing Parliament session.Replying to clarifications in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Mr. Krishna was positive about the prospects of the two countries normalising their relations in the light of free and frank discussions between the two Prime Ministers.“An ideal situation has come about in transforming our relations. The mood, ambience, tone and tenor of the Pakistan Prime Minister were indeed encouraging and the Indian Prime Minister put across our core concern about terrorism.“I am sure in the light of these discussions by the Prime Minsters we are in the right direction in trying to create trust and harmony. I am sure that ultimately the whole region will stand to benefit from the thaw with Pakistan,'' he said.The Foreign Minister said the first steps towards reducing the distrust quotient by holding talks between the principals of the Foreign Ministries were being taken following Pakistan's assurance of “adequately'' meeting Indian concerns on terrorism.A meeting between the Foreign Secretaries in February this year was intended to send the message to the people of Pakistan that India believes in “open door, open communication policy.''Terming the beheading of a Sikh in Pakistan as “heinous and inhuman,'' the Minister pointed to the unequivocal condemnation by its President Asif Ali Zardari and his assurance of providing adequate security in keeping with his declaration of Pakistan being a pluralistic nation.Mr. Krishna said India was involved in reconstruction work in Afghanistan at the request of its government. “It behoves India that whenever such an invitation comes we should go there and do our humble bit…India is not militarily involved and our volunteers have gone there to help Afghanistan to be self-reliant and self-confident. No doubt there are elements not disposed to be happy with cordial India-Afghan relations. We have lost valiant men but let me assure you that our involvement is going to continue and not going to be deterred by such attacks,'' he declared.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Krishna-sets-ball-rolling-on-dialogue/article16298954.ece

Anyone who volunteers for the job can do it. Even if there is no hangman to be found, any police officer from the rank of a constable can also do it if he volunteers,” a Tihar Jail official said.Legally, the government can appoint a hangman either for short-term or as a permanent appointee.“If there is such a problem, it is only temporary. The government can either appoint someone on a short-term basis or permanently. Moreover, any jail official can also do the job if he wishes,” G. Venkatesh Rao, senior Supreme Court lawyer, who was also involved in the Indira Gandhi Assassination case said.It was in 1989 that Satwant and Kehar Singh, convicted in Indira Gandhi Assassination case, were hanged to death.The latest case of execution was of Dhananjay Chatterjee who got the death penalty for murder.Chatterjee was kept at the Alipore Jail for 14 years before his mercy plea was rejected by former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and he was hanged to death on August 14, 2004.He was executed by the 87-year-old hangman Nata Mullick in West Bengal. Mullick, whose father Shibal Mullick was a hangman in the British colonial days, died in December 2009.Major jails across India face an acute shortage of trained hangmen.Only men are employed for this job and the candidate has to be above 5 feet 4 inches tall.Other than the morbid nature of the job, the meagre salary also acts as a deterrent.

  Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday said conviction of Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab proved that the present laws were adequate to deal with the menace of terror.

They have broad support of all sections...Let's try these acts. If necessary, we can always revisit them.”Mr. Chidamabaram said while he respected the BJP's views, a large section of society, particularly minorities and SCs/STs, rejected these ideas as they feared their misuse against them.Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said though Kasab's conviction was a landmark event, he was disappointed because there were several other accused in the case living in Pakistan and the U.S., from where not much cooperation was forthcoming.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Conviction-came-without-anti-terror-law-Chidambaram/article16298874.ece

314,Tagore's school to celebrate his 150th birth anniversary,Raktima Bose,2010-05-06,15:54:39 IST,"Rabindranath Tagore at the Santiniketan. File photo
  On May 9, when people across the country will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, Kolkata-based St. Xavier's School and College will join in the celebrations for its former student, whose association with the institution, though brief, was close to the poet's heart.Though the Nobel laureate strongly disliked the system of institutionalised education — resulting in his being home-tutored for most of his academic years — he studied at the school for almost two years; perhaps his longest stint as a student in any school during his lifetime, and penned down his memories of the period on several occasions.Organised by the Alumnorum Societas and the St. Xavier's College (Cal) Alumni Association, the celebrations will be marked by a recitation of Tagore's ‘Sesher Kobita' (Last Poem) by actor Soumitra Chatterjee and Dhritiman Chatterji in the presence of several noteworthy alumni of the institution.The programme will also coincide with the school's celebration of its 150th year of existence.Tagore was admitted to the fifth standard in 1875, at the age of 14, along with his elder brother Somendranath Tagore and nephew Satyaprasad Gangopadhyay. The St. Xavier's was the fourth and last school he attended before his father decided to home-tutor him.In one of his accounts, Tagore wrote about his disinterest in school education. “I could understand that my value in the civilised society is going down. But I can never connect myself with a school that shuts out life and natural beauty and conjures up frightening images of a prison or hospital,” he had said.His experience at the St. Xavier's School, according to him, was relatively happier. Though most teachers appeared to him as “mere teaching machines,” he was fond of a Jesuit priest, named Father Alphonsus De Peneranda, who had come from Spain and was appointed a part-time teacher.Tagore reminisced in one of his accounts that while most students in Father Peneranda's class were inattentive due to his lack of fluency in English, the poet felt a deep sense of empathy and respect for his teacher.Historians researching Tagore have found out from school records and accounts of his classmates that the school's annual calendar misspelt the poet's name twice as ‘Nobindronath Tagore,' that he failed in the fifth standard, that his roll number was 36, and that he came to school in a horse-drawn carriage.While Tagore left the school in 1877, he came back to his alma mater in 1931 to preside over a function organised by the teachers and students to collect funds for people affected by the devastating floods in Bengal that year.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Tagores-school-to-celebrate-his-150th-birth-anniversary/article16299038.ece

  BJP tendered an unconditional apology on Thursday for alleged remarks of its member Ananth Kumar in the Lok Sabha against RJD Chief Lalu Prasad during the Census 2011 debate.As soon as the House met for the day, Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj said, “I unconditionally apologise for the remarks made by Mr. Ananth Kumar yesterday.”When Mr. Prasad sought to intervene, Ms. Swaraj said in a lighter vein, “I also apologise on behalf of Mr. Laluji also.”“There is a lot of important business to be done in the House. I appeal to members to help in smooth running of the House,” she said.Mr. Kumar, who was present in the House, however, did not say anything.The BJP member had insisted on Wednesday that he had not made the remarks against Mr. Prasad and would neither apologise nor withdraw them.“I will neither apologise nor withdraw my comments,” Mr. Kumar had told reporters.Ms. Swaraj had said Mr. Kumar has not denied using both Gaddar (traitor) and rashtravirodhi (anti—national)” words during his presentation in Lok Sabha.Both Ms. Swaraj and Mr. Kumar had maintained that the BJP member had not used these two words against Mr. Prasad and there was a misunderstanding among SP, RJD and other members.“But one should understand the context in which Mr. Kumar mentioned them. Our notice demanding a discussion on Census was against the column ‘nationality as declared’ in the National Population Register (NPR) form.

317,SC upholds Constitutional validity of MPLAD scheme,PTI,2010-05-06,11:07:25 IST,"The Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional validity of the MPLAD scheme under which members of Parliament are allocated Rs two crore annually for development of their constituencies.“We hold that the MPLAD scheme is valid,” a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said in a unanimous verdict.“There is no reason for us to interfere in the scheme,” the bench also comprising Justices R.V. Raveendran, D.K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and J.M. Panchal said.The bench, however, said improvements can be made in the working of the scheme.The bench said the mere allegations that the funds are prone to be misused cannot be a ground for scrapping the scheme.It said that both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have standing committees to monitor the scheme and there are various levels of accountability for its implementation.The apex court said that the scheme has benefited the local area development by way of providing water, electricity, infrastructure, library and sports facilities.It rejected the contention of the opponents of the scheme that it gives an unfair advantage to the sitting MPs against their political rivals.The bench said there is no reason to believe that the MPLADS cannot be implemented and monitored by the district authorities. The scheme is for the public interest and public purpose.The court said it was satisfied that under the scheme, there is no violation of separation of power.Interpreting Articles 282 of the Constitution, the bench said that Parliament validly holds power to disburse funds for the scheme.The scheme had come under judicial scrutiny after a sting operation in 2005 showed some MPs allegedly demanding money from contractors to award work for projects under MPLAD scheme. The expose had led to the expulsion of members from both Houses of Parliament.The MPLAD scheme had been in the news in 2006 due to allegations that trusts run by the then Election Commissioner Navin Chawla’s family got funds from the scheme.A three—judge bench on July 12, 2006 had referred the matter to a five—judge Constitution Bench observing that important questions of law needed to be settled.The scheme was first challenged in 1999 by Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party Chief Bhim Singh and an NGO, Common Cause, alleging that in the absence of any guidelines, the funds allocated under the scheme were misused by MPs.Later, petitions were also filed in various high courts and on the Centre’s intervention all the petitions were transferred to the apex court.Attorney General G E Vahanvati, who was then Solicitor General, had submitted that MPLAD Scheme is also a welfare measure implemented with the assistance of the local authorities like other schemes Jawahar Rozgar Yojna, Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme and Integrated Child Development Scheme.The funds under the MPLAD (Member of Parliament Local Area Development) Scheme were directly released by the Centre to the district authorities and it did not go directly in the hands of the MP, he had submitted.The Centre had defended the scheme, saying that it had the authority of law to release money under it as funds were withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India by passing the Appropriation Bill.The opponents of the scheme had alleged it was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution (Right to Equality) as it gave arbitrary powers to an MP without there being proper checks and balances, monitoring and accountability regarding the money being spent under it.NGO Lok Sevak Sangh had contended that the scheme gives an unfair advantage to serving MPs over their rival candidates in elections.The NGO had said the powers exercised or enjoyed by the MPs by virtue of MPLAD scheme results in discrimination between various sections of society in allocation of work.It was argued that though there is a provision in the guidelines that an MP who does not want to use his funds may withdraw from the scheme, it has not been done by any of them.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/SC-upholds-Constitutional-validity-of-MPLAD-scheme/article16298679.ece
318,’26/11 Mumbai attacks help New York police to be better prepared’,PTI,2010-05-06,09:32:30 IST,"New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. File photo: AP.
  The New York Police Department (NYPD), learning lessons from the 26/11 Mumbai attack, has taken necessary steps to prevent any such type of terror attempt, a top US cop said today.“As part of our comprehensive response to what happened in Mumbai, we’ve held tactical drills and tabletop exercises with officers from our Special Operations Division based on that scenario,” New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in his testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.Mr. Kelly had testified before the same committee last year about the NYPD’s response to Mumbai—like terror assault in 2008, which claimed 183 lives.“As you may recall, that attack was carried out by small teams of operatives using AK—56 assault rifles. By sustaining the operation for hours, they maximised the casualties,” he said.NYPD has trained “more than 250 additional officers” in the use of heavy weapons to “supplement” the work of emergency service officers in a crisis.“We’ve also decided to use the instructors in our Firearms and Tactics Unit as another reserve force,” he said, adding that all of its police recruits would now receive basic instruction in three types of heavy weapons.“We’ve taken these and other measures because we believe an attack involving active shooters is always a possibility.Likewise, we must also guard against terrorists armed with homemade bombs, whether a car bomb like the one we saw in Times Square or stashed inside backpacks for a suicide mission like the one planned for last September in New York subways,” Mr. Kelly said.The officer noted that the department’s subway bag search programme is designed to counter terror threats like the 2005 London bombings.Mr. Kelly rued that their undercover operations showed the “ease” with which terrorists can purchase explosive ingredients such as chlorine and ammonium nitrate in the US.“These efforts are part of a robust counter—terrorism programme we built from the ground up in 2002, when we realised that in addition to our focus on crime fighting, the police department needed to build the intelligence collection analysis and infrastructure protection capabilities to defend New York City from another terrorist attack,” Mr. Kelly said.The NYPD had also established the nation’s first municipal counter—terrorism bureau and structured a intelligence division.“We recruited the best that the federal government had to offer to head those two operations,” he said.Similarly, the department had created a new civilian intelligence programme to support field commanders, who have tapped the “incredible” logistic diversity of the police department, with timely information and analysis.“We assigned native speakers of languages such as Urdu, Arabic and Pashtu to counter—terrorism duties. We strengthened our patrol of key infrastructure in the city, including bridges, tunnels and a host of landmarks and other sensitive locations,” Mr. Kelly said while listing out the measures taken after the Mumbai terrorist attack.A team of officials were sent to Mumbai to have first hand information of the terrorist operations there in November—December 2008.“We forged collaborative relationships with the private sector with law enforcement organisations up and down the East Coast and with federal agencies, especially the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security,” Mr. Kelly added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rsquo2611-Mumbai-attacks-help-New-York-police-to-be-better-preparedrsquo/article16298672.ece
319,"In public interest, Centre keen on intervening in MCI",Aarti Dhar,2010-05-06,02:03:56 IST,"The Centre is contemplating bringing in an ordinance to amend the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 empowering the government to intervene in the event of MCI members, including the president and the vice-president, being unable to perform and on grounds of misconduct.The ordinance seeks to fix the term — to a maximum of two – of the president and the vice-president and give the Union Health Ministry powers to make arrangements in the event the office of president falling vacant in unforeseen situations as it has arisen now. The functioning of the Medical Council of India has come to a virtual standstill following the arrest of its president, Ketan Desai, on corruption charges.These amendments are expected to incorporate major changes suggested by the Ministry in the amendment Bill, tabled in 2005, which were turned down by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health.Sources in the Ministry told The Hindu it was keen that the government be able to intervene in the MCI in the “larger public interest” as did the Human Resource Development Ministry in the case of the All-India Council for Technical Education and the University Grants Commission under Section 20 (1) of the AICTE and the UGC Acts though these were nominated bodies. The MCI is an elected body with no such provision for intervention by the Centre. A provision for intervention was turned down by the Standing Committee on the ground that it would seriously jeopardise the independent working of the MCI and decision making of its president and vice-president.
Final decision
The proposed amendments to the MCI Act — if and as approved by Parliament — will continue until the government takes a final decision on whether medical education should come under the purview of the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) under the HRD Ministry or the National Council for Human Resource in Health being pushed by the Health Ministry.Meanwhile, the NCHER has invited a Health Ministry representative for its final meeting later this week.

  In a snub to the Manipur government that has banned his visit, National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) leader T. Muivah on Wednesday arrived on the State's frontiers. From there, he is set to embark on a journey to his birthplace, where prohibitory orders have been issued and security heightened to avoid tribal unrest.Mr. Muivah reached Viswema village, near the Nagaland-Manipur border, on his way home to the Somdal village in Ukhrul district.Escorted by members of the Naga civil society, Mr. Muivah left the NSCN-IM headquarters, Camp Hebron, near Dimapur at noon after a brief prayer and arrived here to a warm welcome at the check gate on the National Highway 39. He was then escorted to the Viswema village, 25 km south of this town.Mr. Muivah was to stay overnight at Viswema, from where he had planned to go to Somdal on Thursday, said the Naga Hoho leaders, who are coordinating Mr. Muivah's entourage.The Nagaland police have provided Mr. Muivah with a bullet-proof vehicle, while security forces have been deployed on the national highway, a senior police officer said.At least 50 vehicles, mostly occupied by members of Naga non-governmental organisations, including women, escorted Mr. Muivah to Viswema.In a hurriedly convened press briefing at the NSCN-IM headquarters on Tuesday night, Mr. Muivah said he would go ahead with his planned visit to his village, which he said was agreed upon by the Centre.“I must go there and no force can stop me. My parents died waiting to meet their son.”He said he failed to understand why Manipur was objecting to his visit, adding: “The opposition to my visit came as a surprise...the visit is for peace, to meet family and friends and not to disturb anyone...We will not claim anything which belongs to the Meiteis [an ethnic group of Manipur], let them have theirs, we will only have what is rightfully ours.”The Manipur government has stepped up security and clamped prohibitory orders on the other side of the Mao inter-State gate to thwart the entry of the Naga leader.The NSCN-IM, one of the oldest and powerful rebel groups in the northeast, has been demanding a ‘greater Nagaland,' which it proposed be formed by merging the Naga-populated areas of adjoining States. The demand has been rejected by Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.Union Home Minister P.

321,‘Recognise right to worship Ram Lalla',J. Venkatesan,2010-05-06,01:40:03 IST,"The right to worship Ram Lalla at the disputed site at Ayodhya must be recognised by court. For, this place has been believed to be the birth place of Lord Ram by millions of Hindus for several centuries, senior counsel Ravi Shankar Prasad argued in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court.A Full Bench comprising Justices S.U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D.V. Sharma is hearing final arguments in the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. In the suits pending since 1989 Muslims sought a declaration that the area in dispute be declared a Babri mosque.After the completion of arguments on behalf of the plaintiffs in March, senior Supreme Court lawyer Prasad, representing the interest of Hindu worshippers, who claim as of right worship of the deity of Ram Lalla at Ram Janmasthan at Ayodhya, commenced his arguments on May 3.Mr. Prasad argued that in Hindu ethos and Hindu customary law, duly sanctified for the last thousands of years, “the concept of deity is a very distinguishing feature unlike in other religions. This deity is the manifestation of the Supreme Being which is eternal, permanent and omnipresent. The temple is the home of the god and the idol is a manifestation of the Supreme Being.”Quoting scriptures, he said: “The Hindus' concept of deity can also be shapeless and formless as they worship both Vayu and Agni. Even a log of wood or a piece of stone or the Sangam at Prayag, where — it has been believed by people for generations — a dip in the trinity of three rivers washes one of all sins, has also been exalted to the status of a deity. The Hindu concept is that a deity does not die nor is it subject to decay, and if an idol is stolen or is damaged or is defiled, a new idol installed [at the same place] acquires the antiquity of the old.”Counsel said: “The Ram Janmasthan fully answers the description of a deity held in reverence by the Hindus for the last thousands of years.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lsquoRecognise-right-to-worship-Ram-Lalla/article16298620.ece

  | Photo Credit: Sushanta Patronobish Announcing the induction of West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC) working president Subrata Mukherjee into the Trinamool Congress here on Wednesday, party chief Mamata Banerjee indirectly accused the State Congress of “conspiring” with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to break up the alliance between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress in the State.“The people's grand alliance has struggled against the tyranny of the CPI(M) for the past 33 years. Whichever party might conspire with and support the CPI(M), it is useless since the latter has lost all power…these agents of the CPI(M) will eventually realise that the real power rests with the people's grand alliance as those who flee from a battlefield are never respected,” Ms. Banerjee said.The Trinamool chief was speaking at a press conference where Mr. Mukherjee formally announced his decision to quit the Congress and join the Trinamool.Pointing out that her party is a “part and parcel” of the coalition government at the Centre and is committed to the alliance, she claimed that it had always tried to maintain the alliance and had worked hard accordingly.Exuding confidence about her party's prospects in the upcoming civic polls, Ms. Banerjee asserted that Mr. Mukherjee's decision to rejoin the Trinamool was “necessary for history, for change, for the State and its people” and appointed him the party's senior vice-president.Echoing Ms. Banerjee's words, Mr. Mukherjee said he had of late started doubting the Congress' intention of maintaining the alliance and felt “useless” in the party. “The truth is that it was a deliberate attempt to break the alliance. The CPI(M) has a major role behind it ,” he added.After functioning as Mayor of Kolkata under the Trinamool banner, Mr. Mukherjee had left the party and joined the Congress five years ago following differences of opinion with Ms. Banerjee.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Trinamool-committed-to-alliance-Mamata/article16298660.ece

324,Criminals may benefit but citizens' rights should be protected: Court,J. Venkatesan,2010-05-06,00:08:26 IST,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would be failing in its duty if it permitted any citizen to be forcibly subjected to narco-analysis, brain mapping and polygraph tests in violation of his privacy. Notwithstanding the fact that its judgment would benefit hardened criminals who had no regard for societal values, the court had a constitutional right to protect the rights of citizens.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said: “One of the main functions of constitutionally prescribed rights is to safeguard the interests of citizens in their interactions with the government. As guardians of these rights, we will be failing in our duty if we permit any citizen to be forcibly subjected to these tests.”
Unjustified intrusion
Irrespective of the need to expedite investigations in sensitive cases, no person, who was a victim of an offence, could be compelled to undergo any of these tests. Such forcible administration would be an unjustified intrusion into mental privacy and could lead to further stigma for the victim.“It must be borne in mind that in constitutional adjudication our concerns are not confined to the facts at hand but extend to the implications of our decision for the whole population as well as future generations.”The Bench said: “Forcing an individual to undergo any of these techniques violates the standard of ‘substantive due process' which is required for restraining personal liberty. Such a violation will occur irrespective of whether these techniques are forcibly administered during the course of an investigation or for any other purpose since the test results could also expose a person to adverse consequences of a non-penal nature.”
Inhuman treatment
On the contention that these techniques could be read into the statute within the ambit of ‘medical examination' in the Criminal Procedure Code, the Bench said such an expansive interpretation was not feasible. “It would also amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with regard to the language of evolving international human rights norms. Furthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered from these techniques comes into conflict with the right to a fair trial. Invocations of a compelling public interest cannot justify the dilution of constitutional rights such as the right against self-incrimination.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that a person could make an incriminating statement on being threatened with the prospective administration of any of these techniques. Conversely, a person who has been forcibly subjected to these techniques could be confronted with the results in a subsequent interrogation, thereby eliciting incriminating statements. While the scheme of criminal procedure as well as evidence law mandates interference with physical privacy through statutory provisions that enable arrest, detention, search and seizure, among others, the same cannot be the basis for compelling a person ‘to impart personal knowledge about a relevant fact'.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that an individual may give his/her consent to undergo the said tests on account of threats, false promises or deception by the investigators. For example, a person may be convinced to give his/her consent after being promised that this would lead to early release from custody or dropping of charges. However, after the administration of the tests the investigators may renege on such promises. In such a case, the relevant inquiry is not confined to the apparent voluntariness of the act of undergoing the tests, but also includes an examination of the totality of circumstances. The questionable scientific reliability of these techniques comes into conflict with the standard of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt' which is an essential feature of criminal law.”
“Only an aid”
The former CBI Director, R.K. Raghavan, welcoming the judgment, said: “These tests are a dubious tool in the hands of the investigator. It [test] has been more romanticised than the real benefit in the investigation. Within my knowledge, it has not served any useful purpose in any major investigation. It is only an aid.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Criminals-may-benefit-but-citizens-rights-should-be-protected-Court/article16298615.ece
325,All radioactive sources of varsity irradiator accounted for: AERB,R. Ramachandran,2010-05-06,00:04:22 IST,"The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) has identified and accounted for all the cobalt-60 radioactive sources originally present in the gamma cell irradiator of the Chemistry Department of Delhi University.Stating this in a pres release here on Wednesday, the AERB said that the sources would continue to remain in the safe custody of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).It would be recalled that the irradiator, supplied by the Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) in 1968, had been in disuse since 1985 and was auctioned away to scrap dealers on February 26. This had found its way to the metal scrap market of Mayapuri in West Delhi. Without realising that there was a radioactive source in the scrap, two Mayapuri shops where the scrap had finally landed dismantled the equipment and cut open the irradiator into several pieces. This resulted in the people directly involved in the operation and handling the pieces to high doses of radiation. This caused severe radiation poisoning of seven people engaged in the scrap metal business one of whom has since died. The other six continue to battle for life – one at Apollo Hospitals and the rest at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.Following a complete survey of the market, officials of the AERB and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) stated that they located 11 radioactive sources in all — eight from one shop, two from another and one from an individual who was in its possession. Given the badly mangled state of the irradiator and its pieces, it was not clear then whether the 11 sources were all separate sources or were pieces of a single source. These radioactive materials were moved from Mayapuri in mid-April to the Narora Atomic Power Station (NAPS) in U. P.Detailed inspections of the materials recovered were carried out by the AERB officials at NAPS on May 3 and 4 following which the statement was issued. The statement clarifies that all the pieces originated from this single Delhi University gamma irradiator's Co-60 source. This also makes it clear that reports appearing in the media about ‘missing radioactive pencils' and the ‘source trail leading to Rewari (in Haryana)' were incorrect.According to S. K. Malhotra of the DAE, the reconstruction was made possible by the details of the original device that was supplied to the university in 1968, which the AERB managed to obtain from the AECL. Apparently the AECL responded to the query with great efficiency and supplied the details of the sale 42 years ago within a couple of hours. Mr. Malhotra also confirmed the initial activity of the source was over 3,000 curies (Ci). After 42 years, or 8 half-life periods of Co-60, the activity would have dropped by a factor of 2 to the power of 8, or 256, only. (One curie stands for 37 billion radioactive decays/sec.)According to the details provided by the AECL, the source chamber had provision for 54 pencils of Co-60 of which only 16 were occupied at the time of supply based on the requirements specified by the user. Each cylindrical pencil is made of 7 ‘slugs' or pieces of Co-60, each measuring about 2.5 cm x 0.6 cm stacked together and all the pencils constitute a unit that can be placed around any material to be irradiated with gamma rays. The AERB claimed that they were able to account for all the 112 slugs of the 16-pencil Co-60 source unit.In a related development, the Delhi University teachers' Association (DUTA) has demanded an impartial enquiry by the President of India, who is the Visitor of the university, into the callous disposal of the Co-60 source to scrap dealers. In particular, the DUTA has called for a enquiry into the constitution by the vice-chancellor of the committee that authorised its disposal and into the inexplicable silence on the part of the university authorities for as long as 20 days when the Delhi police and the AERB were groping in darkness to hunt down the origin of the radioactive material. “In this context, the speedy work by the Delhi Police in tracking down the origin to the Chemistry Department of Delhi University needs to be commended, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/All-radioactive-sources-of-varsity-irradiator-accounted-for-AERB/article16298577.ece

Doctors who attended on her said measles was the immediate cause for her death. She was admitted to the hospital on Monday. The doctors said Bency had the HIV encephalitis syndrome.The funeral rites will be held at a date to be declared later since the arrival of her maternal uncle is awaited. Together with her HIV-infected brother Benson (13), she was under the care of their blind grandmother at Kaithakuzhy near here. The funeral will be held under the supervision of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society.The body was brought to Kollam later in the eveningto be placed at the mortuary. A spokesman for the AIDS Control Society said a decision on how to handle the dead body before the funeral would be taken by the Society on Thursday. There is no harm in conducting the funeral as per Christian rites, the spokesman has said.Bency and Benson are children of AIDS-infected parents. Their father C.K. Chandy died in 1997 and their mother, Princy, in 2000. At the time Bency was 5 years old and Benson, 3. They then came under the care of their maternal grandparents. Their grandfather Geevarghese passed away in 2006.The siblings were one of the best publicised cases of HIV-positive children being denied access to school. The issue had attracted the attention of even the international media. Attempts by the grandparents to get them admitted in several schools were denied mainly because parents of other students threatened to withdraw their children from the schools if the siblings were allowed to study there.This compelled Geevarghese to undertake a fast in Thiruvananthapuram in 2003, which in turn resulted in the then Chief Minister A.K. Antony, calling a high-level meeting to solve the issue. Initially, a private tutor was appointed at their home and exams were also written separately.Later, as the constant campaign on AIDS awareness began producing results, the siblings were given admission to one of the schools that earlier denied them admission. Bency and Benson were presently studying at the Adichanalur Panchayat High School with other children. Bency was in Class 9 and had been promoted to Class 10.In September 2003, during an interaction with the siblings in Thiruvananthapuram, the then Union Minster for Health and Family Welfare, Sushma Swaraj, hugged them in public in an attempt to dispel myths and the stigma attached to the condition. On that occasion, Ms. Swaraj announced the public-sector Hindustan Latex would meet the educational expenses of the siblings for five years. Benson and Bency also had a meeting with former President of India A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Bency-passes-away/article16298837.ece

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has provided financial assistance to set up the Rs. 50-lakh Agro Park. Mango growers can bring their product here and get them sorted, graded, ripened and packed for export or to send it to cities like Mumbai and Delhi for a good price.The Agro Park employs ethylene-based ripening , which is recognised internationally as a safe method for ripening fruits. The Park has ripening and pre-cooling chambers. This mangoes can be kept for three weeks without damage, said Becker Palliparambil, exporter of mangoes to the Gulf countries and the persons behind the new Agro Park.He said four tonnes of mangoes can be ripened at a time. The park will function round the clock during the season to benefit the farmers of Muthalamada and other places.Mango growers here had been using a lot of chemical pesticides to kill fruit flies, which rupture the outer skin of the fruit to lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the pulp of the ripe fruit. Deputy Director of Agriculture Department (Horticulture Mission) Jose Varghese says these insects can be effectively controlled by the new methods used in the Agro Park.At present, calcium carbide is widely used for ripening mango. In this case, the acetylene gas liberated is highly carcinogenic. This has to be strictly avoided. To get more orders and good prices in national and international markets, mango should be organically cultivated and ripened, he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Muthalamada-lsquomango-city-goes-hi-tech/article16298828.ece

334,100 injured in Kinaloor violence,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,19:48:20 IST,"About 100 people including policemen were injured in a pitched battle between the police and local people at Kinaloor, 24 km from here, on Thursday after several hundred protestors prevented a team of revenue officials from conducting a feasibility survey for a proposed four-lane road to the KSIDC industrial park located on the Kinaloor industrial park.The protestors had blocked the load leading to the estate with large boulders and timber logs in the morning when the officials, led by Revenue Divisional Officer K.P. Remadevi, arrived for the survey. Soon a pitched battle broke out between the protestors and the police and women constables were seen dragging women and children from the frontline of the blockade.The police resorted to a lathicharge to cow down the protestors and they responded by hurling stones at the police. Several protestors including women and at least one child were injured in the lathicharge. Several policemen sustained injuries in stone-throwing. The police used a grenade and teargas to disperse the crowd. They chased the protestors into nearby houses.The residents in the area have been questioning the rationale of laying a four-lane road to the park ever since a Malaysian government agency that had proposed a satellite city at Kinaloor withdrew from the project in September 2008. Also, there are rumours of a ‘land mafia' having purchased large swathes of land at Kinaloor in view of the Malaysian project.The police allegedly damaged a car and a motorbike owned by a persons after he refused to cooperate with policemen searching for fleeing protestors. His daughter told presspersons that the policemen used expletives and behaved in a menacing manner.Thamarassery Deputy Superintendent of Police Kuberan Namboodiri was among those who suffered major injuries. Among the 55 persons who came to the Community Health Centre at Balussery for treatment, 44 were police personnel.A protestor who sustained injuries on his back and left leg said several persons injured in the lathicharge did not seek treatment in hospital for fear of police persecution.The survey resumed after the police managed to disperse the protestors.Meanwhile, a tense situation gripped the area outside the estate when Communist Party of India (Marxist) activists and the protestors regrouped there. This time, the police preferred to watch the situation from a safe distance.The CPI(M) workers alleged that the protest and violence were orchestrated by outside elements. They said the policemen were provoked into lathicharging after the protestors sprayed a solution of cow dung on them.The protestors said they had only convened a Jana Jagrata Samiti on the occasion. “We blocked the team that came for the survey three times earlier. There were policemen then too, but no violence happened. This time, policemen were sent with orders to use force against us,” alleged a protestor.District leaders of the Congress, Indian Union Muslim League, Bharatiya Janata Party and the Solidarity Youth Movement soon arrived at the scene. The situation eased following Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan's orders to stop the survey. The Chief Minister directed the District Collector to submit a report on the incident.

  | Photo Credit: S_K_MOHAN The ongoing agitation by the local residents against a toddy shop at South Bazar here and the counter-protests by toddy tappers reached a flashpoint on Thursday. Irate toddy tappers, led by their union leaders, stormed into the venue of the agitation, destroyed the thatched structure erected by the agitators and opened the toddy shop that had remained closed for over 40 days.The toddy tappers reached the venue in a procession around 11.15 a.m. demanding that the shop, employing 30 toddy tappers, be allowed to function. Police personnel, outnumbered by the toddy tappers, were pushed aside and they remained mute witnesses to what followed.As the toddy tappers gave vent to their wrath, local residents at the venue ran to the safety of a nearby house. The workers then opened the toddy shop and measured the toddy brought there. The incident occurred after Sarvodaya Mandalam leader Thayat Balan inaugurated the fast by a resident expressing solidarity with the agitation.
Some injured
The agitators alleged that four women were injured in the assault by the toddy tappers. The union leaders claimed that a toddy tapper was also injured. A policeman also suffered injuries in the melee.The agitation began on March 23 when a group of local people came out against the shifting of the toddy shop from an old rented building to a new building, hardly 10 metres away, purchased by the co-operative society running the toddy shop. All efforts for a settlement came to naught as the agitators insisted that the toddy shop, which has been in the area for 42 years, will not be allowed in the locality.
Question of livelihood
The toppy tappers' union leaders said that the workers were just asserting their right to do their job. They claimed that the agitators refused to attend meetings to discuss alternatives. The workers could not be afford to be onlookers when they were denied their right to livelihood, they added.Kerala Madya Nirodhana Samiti activist T.P.R. Nath, who was at the venue of the agitation when the workers went berserk, said the agitators would discuss with supporting organisations the future course of action.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Toddy-tappers-agitators-clash/article16298825.ece

  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised to refer to an expert panel Kerala's plea for conferring ‘classical' status to Malayalam.The Prime Minister, who gave a patient hearing to the delegation led by Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy, Culture Minister M.A. Baby and poets O. N. V. Kurup, Sugathakumari and K. Satchidanandan, said while Kerala appeared to have a strong case, it was for experts to decide on the State's plea.“The Prime Minister gave us a warm welcome and patiently listened to our arguments. We are hopeful that this initiative by the Culture Minister and the State government would produce a positive outcome,” O.N.V. Kurup told The Hindu here on Thursday evening.“This is a very significant initiative by the Culture Minister which was long overdue. We look forward to some change. We will also continue to strive for securing classical language status for Malayalam,” added Sugathakumari.A language is accorded classical status if it is at least 1,000 years old, has a rich a literature and an independent literary tradition. Malayalam is the only South Indian language that has not been accorded classical status.“We are not asking for any relaxation in the criteria because we are confident that Malayalam does fulfil all the criteria. What we ask for is patient consideration of our arguments which, we are confident, no independent minded panel would be able to reject,” said O.N.V. Kurup.
Submits memorandum
In the memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister, the delegation pointed out that Malayalam had developed sufficiently much earlier than 12th century.Malayalam, the memorandum said, is as ancient as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada as it belonged to the Proto Dravidian family of languages. It was the language of the ancient ‘Chera' Kingdom, which underwent gradual transition like its sister languages, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu. For long, the word ‘Tamil' was a synonym for the word language. ‘In fact this served as a misty curtain to hide the antiquity of Malayalam Language,' the memorandum said and added that it was significant that Malayalam versions and commentaries of Sanskrit works were mentioned as ‘Tamil Kuttu' (Tamil book), an important example being the Malayalam annotation of the famous Sanskrit Lexicon, ‘Amarakosham' which was mentioned as ‘Amaram Tamill Kuttu'.The first available work in Malayalam, ‘Ramacharitham,' was proof of a rich heritage of poetic culture. Further, the present Malayalam script ‘Granthalipi' can be found in ancient Kerala writings from as far back as 9th century AD, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Panel-to-go-into-Keralas-appeal/article16298933.ece
337,State takes up NH issue with Manmohan,J. Balaji,2010-05-06,02:48:12 IST,"Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan led an all-party State delegation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh here on Wednesday and urged him to reduce the requirement for right of way (RoW) for National Highway (NH) development projects in the State to 30 metres from the proposed 45 metres.The delegation opposed the implementation of the projects in the State on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis as this would lead to collection of toll. The delegation wanted the Centre to invest in the NH projects directly. It sought adequate rehabilitation and resettlement packages for the evictees. They pointed out that in many stretches land was being acquired only on one side of the road and not in equal measures on either side. A width of 45 metres was too heavy a demand in a densely populated State like Kerala (with a population density of 819 per sq km). Moreover, religious institutions and historical monuments needed to be protected.Later, the Chief Minister told journalists that the Prime Minister had agreed to consider the request. He said that over 15 lakh people would get affected if the highways were expanded to 45 metres. There were lots of agitations and police actions which made the government to rethink on the subject after an all-party meet.Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy said the Congress, in principle, was not against the BOT package for NH 47 and NH 17. But the Centre had initially agreed to expand the highways with its own funds, he said.The delegates also urged the Centre to move the Supreme Court to get the stay given by the Karnataka High Court on night traffic on NH 67 and NH 212 connecting Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, vacated.Regarding the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, the delegates told the Prime Minister that though Kerala was committed to adopting the national pattern, it required some time. The Centre should extend funding to the State under the project without insisting on a change in the age of entry to school immediately. “As a transition management measure, the State may be allowed to convert Class I as pre-primary and the Centre may finance the expenses involved,” they said promising that in due course the age of entry would be changed to six.On the Kochi Metro project, the delegation sought early Central clearance with the participation of the Centre with the requisite external funding. They want this to be implemented on the Delhi metro formula and pointed out that the Centre need to spend only Rs.450 crore on the Kochi project.Among others, Ministers C. Divakaran, N.K. Premachandran, Jose Thettayil, Kadannappaly Ramachandran, K.P. Rajendran, M. Vijayakumar, and M.A. Baby, MPs M.I. Shanavas (Congress), Jose K. Mani (Kerala Congress-M) and E.T.

338,Luck by chance,Nita Sathyendran,2010-05-06,16:02:09 IST,"Deal or No Deal
  | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT I
n the few months since it has been on air, Surya TV's game show ‘Deal or No Deal' appears to have come up trumps for its exciting format, suspense factor, remarkable participants, glamorous models (who hold the cases with the money) and of course most of all, its affable host – actor Mukesh. ‘Deal or No Deal,' which recently completed 50 episodes and which airs on the weekends at 19.30, hinges on the decision-making ability of the contestants. The contestants have to figure out whether to call the deal offered by the banker or override the deal and continue playing for possible higher stakes. Mukesh, who is revelling in his second avatar as a game show host after his stint in ‘Kodeeswaran,' talks about the show to Friday Review. Excerpts from an interview…
Different formats of ‘Deal or No Deal' are aired in over 73 countries and perhaps in as many languages. What is different about the Malayalam version?
Apart from me, you mean? (Laughs). Just kidding. Actually, it is the participants who make the show the success that it is.They are simply superb. They are people with fascinating stories of life. They come from all walks of life – from fisher folk to teachers to scientists and what not, but what makes each of them so special is that they don't come here for the money or fame. Instead they come here to change their lives, change perspectives. For them winning money is secondary.
Change their lives, perspectives?
Well, for instance, in an episode there was a woman from Neyyatinkara who came on the show with her infant son with the hope that her missing/estranged husband would see the bubbly youngster and then want to come back home to them. Then again there was an 18-year-old who came on the show to request me to tell his father, a stonemason, that he (the father) should not spend his entire savings on alcohol.Likewise myriad such stories. The more I host the show the more I realise that it is all about human relationships.
What is your biggest challenge as the anchor?
Since there is a lot of one-to-one interaction between the contestants and myself, I have to constantly think on my feet. There is no script and you can never know what the contestants will ask/say. That's where my experience in mimicry, theatre, films and with life itself comes in handy.
How different is this stint as an anchor?
Being the host of ‘Kodeeswaran' gave me the confidence that I can do this one too. This time around, though, it is much more physically and mentally taxing.In ‘Kodeeswaran' I was comfortably ensconced in a chair asking predetermined questions and only crack a joke or two in between. Here I have to stand throughout the show and help contestants make their decisions on whether to deal or not to deal.
How do you help contestants make their decisions on something that appears to have more to do with luck than logic?
Actually luck only comes in the initial phase of the game. Once you go ahead its all about making the right decision at the right time. Of course, it is up to the contestant to deal or not to deal but I can be their support system and explain the pros and cons.

Thambidurai (AIADMK) said the Bill was brought with a political motive to accommodate some persons as it was sure that the AIADMK was going to capture power in Tamil Nadu in 2011 Assembly poll.He said the Council was a symbol of British legacy and its revival was a retrograde step.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Parliament-nod-for-Council-Bill/article16298959.ece

  Responding to a request from Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the Centre has allotted an additional 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice and 65,000 tonnes of wheat to the State.Replying to Peter Alphonse (Congress), Mr. Karunanidhi informed the Assembly on Thursday that he had made the request in the morning in New Delhi. “By the time I returned to Chennai in the evening, the order for the allotment had already reached Chennai.”Earlier, Food Minister E.V. Velu said the State normally received 2.96 lakh tonnes of rice from the Centre each month. Of this just over 65,000 tonnes was meant for distribution to Anthyodaya Anna Yojana families. This rice was supplied to Tamil Nadu at Rs.3 a kg. Another 1.04 lakh tonnes was given at Rs.5.65 a kg for Below Poverty Line families.For the remaining, the State paid Rs.8.35 a kg, which was the open market rate for rice supplied by the Centre (for 1.26 lakh tonnes). This was for above poverty line families. But, the intake had gone up, possibly because of the Re.1 a kg scheme of the government.The demand now stood at 3.17 lakh tonnes a month, he said, and added that this meant a significant deficit, which totalled to over 2.3 lakh tonnes per annum. The Centre had now allocated 2.5 lakh tonnes.Answering a question, Transport Minister K.N.

  The Madras High Court has directed the State government to take up enumeration of heritage buildings in Tamil Nadu that have been listed in the report filed by the Justice E.Padmanabhan Committee.Allowing a writ petition filed by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), a Bench comprising Justices Prabha Sridevan and P.P.S.Janarthana Raja said that immediate direction must be passed to protect all such buildings/places in the State, wherever they may be and cited as an example the 150-year-old Kuthirai Vandi Court in Coimbatore that has become home to anti-social elements .The Bench restrained Life Insurance Corporation of India from demolishing the Bharath Insurance building without complying with regulation 22 of the Development Control Rules for the Chennai Metropolitan Area, 2004.
Directive to HCC
It has directed the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) to assess the value and feasibility of retaining the Bharath Insurance building. “As far as possible the building must be saved.The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and the Chennai Corporation, with the consultation of the HCC, shall issue directions for the protection of the building,” the judges said.The Bharath Insurance building, situated on Anna Salai, is an example of Indo-Saracenic architecture.Work on the construction of the building began in 1894 and it was inaugurated in 1897 as Kardyl Building, headquarters of ‘W.E.Smith & Co Ltd.'In 1934, it was sold to Bharath Insurance by Spencer's. Later, when life insurance was nationalised, the building and the company were taken over by the LIC.In 1998, the LIC initiated a process of eviction of tenants in the building on the grounds that it was unsafe for occupation due to its dilapidated condition.The HCC has been asked to recommend to the government steps to notify buildings listed by it as heritage buildings and within three months, cause notices to be issued to the concerned, especially the private owners, in respect of buildings listed by the Justice E.Padmanabhan committee so that there is no threat of demolition of destruction or alteration to such buildings.The Bench has asked the State government to issue rules to prevent persons from undertaking any repair, even in the name of renovation of heritage buildings without seeking the necessary approval of the HCC.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Restraint-on-demolition-of-heritage-building/article16298583.ece

347,"Prime accused absconding, 23 convicted in Bathani Tola massacre case",Shoumojit Banerjee,2010-05-06,20:07:25 IST,"A local court on Wednesday convicted 23 people for perpetrating the horrific massacre of 21 Dalits at Bathani Tola in Bhojpur in 1996.However, as with the April 7 verdict on the 1997 Laxmanpur-Bathe massacre, the notorious supremo of the Ranvir Sena and the prime accused - Brahmeshwar Singh “Mukhiya” - has been pronounced an “absconder” by the police along with five others in this case as well.A total of 53 people faced trial, out of which 30 were acquitted. The quantum of the judgement is to be pronounced on May 12.The carnage took place on the afternoon of July 11, 1996, when upper-caste landowners of the Ranvir Sena (a private militia of the landlords) stormed Bathani Tola in Bhojpur’s Sahar block and ruthlessly hacked 21 Dalits to death.The slain included women, teenage girls and babies less than 10 months old.An FIR was lodged against 33 people the day after the massacre. In all, the Bhojpur police framed charges against 63 persons in October 1996.The case was committed to the court of the Sessions judge on January 24, 1998, with charges being framed against 62 accused (one person had died by that time) on March 24, 2000.However, after the Central Bihar caste massacres violently concluded with the Mianpur carnage, the case against Brahmeshwar has been getting progressively murkier, with the police repeatedly failing to bring charges against the Mukhiya.Listed as an “absconder” by the Sahar police since 1996, no FIR, quite inexplicably, has ever been registered by the police against Brahmeshwar till date.The Mukhiya continues to be a non-FIR accused even after he was nabbed from Patna’s Exhibition road on August 29, 2002.While the government dithers on Brahmeshwar’s case fearing an upper-caste backlash this crucial election year, highly sceptical ponderings which surfaced soon after the Bathe verdict, are slowly turning into a cruel certainty in what is being constituted as “an open cover-up” on part of the government in Bhojpur judicial circles.“It is hard to fathom as to what is preventing the police and the government in bringing to book this criminal, who has been lodged in Ara jail since 2002,” said Special Public Prosecutor Mr. Rambabu Prasad, speaking to The Hindu from Ara. “This clearly shows that both the police and the government are not interested in ensuring that justice is meted out.”When questioned, the SP Bhojpur told this correspondent that Brahmeshwar did not stand trial as “certain court proceedings initiated against him were yet to be completed.”With the police’s failure to produce the “Butcher of Bathani Tola” in the Patna Sessions Court on April 7, a disturbing aspect of the case has been the repeated feigning of “confusion” on its part as to the status of Brahmeshwar’s investigation.The police has also conveniently the blamed the prosecution for failing to serve them notice regarding Brahmeshwar’s location.An absurd pretext, given that practically everyone in Bihar knows the Mukhiya to be safely ensconced in Ara jail for the last 8 years and counting.Meanwhile, Mr. Prasad said that he has filed a petition in the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Ara on April 19, urging the case against Brahmeshwar to be committed to the Sessions court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Prime-accused-absconding-23-convicted-in-Bathani-Tola-massacre-case/article16298833.ece
348,Jaipur hospital conducts successful bariatric surgery,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,20:03:21 IST,"Doctors at Fortis Escorts Hospital here have performed the first single-incision bariatric surgery in north India to treat a 31-year-old woman for obesity. The surgery for weight loss left only one scar and also treated the patient's related disorders such as acidity, insomnia, snoring and high cholesterol.Ajay Sharma, gastro-intestinal surgeon, said here on Thursday that the new laparoscopic surgery reduces the risks of infection, speeds up healing and helps reduce post-operative pain. The specialised surgical procedure was conducted here this past week for the first time in any northern State.A few attempts made for the single-incision surgery in Delhi had earlier failed. Dr. Sharma said the surgical technique required surgeons to learn specialised skills to perform the operation through a solitary incision against four or more in the traditional surgery, in which each incision has the potential to become infected and cause pain.Dr. Sharma said the woman patient weighed 98 kg and her body mass index (BMI) was 41 against 27 for a normal person. She did not get any relief from the regular yoga, diet control and fat loss medicines consumed for quite some time.Doctors at the hospital conducted tests such as sonography, liver function, thyroid and hormone profiles on the woman and concluded that her obesity could be controlled by bariatric surgery. A single 2.5-mm incision was made in the abdomen during the operation and the patient fully recovered within three days without any stitch marks or scars.Besides the removal of fat in the minimally invasive surgery, a portion of the stomach was detached to decrease the food intake and reduce the release of hormones responsible for deposition of fat. Dr. Sharma said the woman lost seven kg within 12 days and resumed her daily routine.The single-incision surgery was earlier performed at Fortis Escorts Hospital for gallbladder, appendix and hernia. Dr. Sharma said more weight loss surgeries though single-incision had been planned during this month after the first successful bariatric operation.Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gradually gaining ground in several other areas of medicine as well. For the obese people, the procedure leads to long-term loss of weight, recovery from diabetes, improvement in cardiovascular risk factors and a reduction in mortality.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Jaipur-hospital-conducts-successful-bariatric-surgery/article16298832.ece
349,INLD accuses Hooda Govt. of trying to influence voters,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,20:02:14 IST,"Even as 1,371 nomination papers were filed till Wednesday for the general municipal elections in Haryana due on May 20, the Indian National Lok Dal on Thursday condemned the “brazen manner'' in which the Haryana Government was “trying to influence the voters''.INLD spokesperson K.C. Bangar said the party had urged the State Election Commissioner Dharam Vir to “intervene and uphold the Model Code of Conduct to ensure free and fair elections''.Dr. Bangar alleged that the State Government was “posting certain officials owing allegiance to the ruling party in key positions''. The INLD had drawn the attention of the election office to the fact that with the notification for holding the municipal elections on May 20 issued on April 26, the Code of Conduct had become immediately effective. Therefore no transfer of officials should have been made after the notification without the approval of the Election Commission.However, the Government had transferred O.P. Sheoran, Deputy Commissioner of Palwal, to Hisar as Deputy Commissioner. Dr. Bangar said this “transfer became even more critical in view of the fact that only a few days earlier Mr. Sheoran had been transferred from Hisar to Palwal. The latest transfer orders after the notification of the elections are obviously motivated with the intention of favouring the ruling party and also vitiating the peaceful atmosphere of Hisar''.He charged that in the past too the Bhupinder Singh Hooda regime had been misusing government funds to further the interests of the ruling party. This practice of using government machinery and funds continued unabated in view of the municipal elections. He accused the State Public Relations Department of “releasing advertisements to various magazines and journals with the intention of winning support during the polls''.The INLD has urged the State Election Commissioner to seek a report on all the advertisements that had been released by the Public Relations Department after the elections were notified and urged him to stop such release of funds immediately.The party has also brought to the notice of the State Election Commissioner a public notice published in a newspaper on May 5 informing the public that the Transport Department would issue 1,714 new permits and launch 860 new routes.The spokesman said this was a serious violation of the model code .The Election Commission has also been apprised of enrolment of bogus voters in Kurukshetra and Faridabad and action has been sought against the Deputy Commissioners/ Municipal Commissioners as the case may be.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/INLD-accuses-Hooda-Govt.-of-trying-to-influence-voters/article16298831.ece

Chidambaram has said the Dantewada operation, in which 76 CRPF personnel were massacred by Maoists last month, was planned “thoughtlessly” by top officials of the force there.“I was heartbroken after Dantewada (where 76 personnel were killed on April 6). I did not lose my nerve. I have no fear of Naxalites. One IG, two DIGs and an SP, thoughtlessly without planning, sent 76 troops for recce,” Mr. Chidambaram said, addressing students at a seminar in the Jawaharlal Nehru University, here on Wednesday nightHe said the setback meant that the country was confronting an adversary who is organised in strength.Later talking about developmental issues, Mr. Chidambaram said, “Dantewada has a police station which has only two policemen. When a policeman does not want to go there, how can you expect a teacher or a BDO to go there.”The Minister said that extreme ideology can be propagated in India. “Speech and propagation is free in a democracy but when they take up arms, the conflict arises.”He said there was no confusion about the aim of the Naxals. “The aim is seizure of political power with armed struggle. That is acceptable under certain conditions. Countries under colonialism took this path. Even India saw armed struggle to overthrow British.“There are situations when you are agitated or frustrated. I represent a backward constituency. Development has just started pouring in. If everybody has a justified right to take up arms, what will happen to the country?”He said the debate regarding whether development or police action should take place first in naxal-affected areas is “metaphysical.”“In West Midnapore, police action is needed first. In Gadchiroli, the district has been secured by security forces. Orissa is in a mixed stage, we have progressed in Jharkhand. It is a chicken and egg argument.“Maoists know development is a threat to them, so they demolish schools, 71 schools were blown up in 2009, they mine roads and blow up bridges. Villagers are killed in the name of being informers.... So to say Maoists are pro-development is a very naive argument,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Dantewada-operation-was-lsquothoughtlesslyrsquo-planned-Chidambaram/article16298795.ece

357,Super Eight: England beat Pakistan by six wickets,S. Dinakar,2010-05-06,22:50:17 IST,"England's Kevin Pietersen, left, is congratulated by teammate Tim Bresnan after he took the catch to dismiss Pakistan's batsman Umar Akmal during their Twenty20 Cricket World Cup match in Bridgetown on Thursday.
  Kevin Pietersen is light on his feet and heavy with his strokes. He waltzed at the crease here on Thursday with shots that were both graceful and inventive.The smooth-stroker was unbeaten with a 52-ball 73 as England won the first Super Eights duel of the ICC World Twenty20 by six wickets with three deliveries to spare.Chasing 148 after inserting Pakistan, England, guided by Pietersen's brilliance, managed to nail a potentially hazardous chase on a lively pitch. The innings was well-paced; only two runs were required in the final over.Earlier, paceman Stuart Broad and left-arm spinner Michael Yardy impressed as Pakistan was pegged back when poised for a surge. England, however, was let off the hook by Pakistan's sloppy catching.Saeed Ajmal grassed a regulation offering at mid-on after appearing to have the ball in control to reprieve opener Craig Kieswetter (on zero) off paceman Abdul Razzaq. Then, Ajmal put down Michael Lumb (on 23), left-arm speedster Mohammed Aamer being the bowler to suffer.And Razzaq failed to latch on to a return catch when Pietersen was on 21. It proved a costly lapse.After Kieswetter and the more fluent Lumb had powered England to a strong start - the openers put on 44 in 5.4 overs - Pietersen took charge.Crucially, he forced the Pakistani bowlers to alter their length. He danced down the track to convert the length to drive, loft, flick and glance both the pacemen and the spinners.He won the crucial duel against leg-spinner Shahid Afridi; the on-the-walk strike over cover reflected his urge to dominate. The manner in which Pietersen, using his feet, clipped Afridi displayed his balance and timing.Indeed, Pietersen was at his fluent best. The lofted six over long off - against the spin - off off-spinner Ajmal was high on the scale of difficulty.Paul Collingwood batted smartly, rotating the strike. England lost its skipper and Eoin Morgan towards the end but then Pietersen had inflicted too much damage for his side to be in any trouble.Earlier, Pakistan started in an emphatic manner with Kamran Akmal pulling the first ball of the match - from left-armer Ryan Sidebottom - over the ropes.The dangerous Akmal dazzled briefly before Broad, extracting good bounce from the pitch, consumed the batsman on the hook. Meanwhile, the left-handed Salman Butt, drove, sliced and flicked to the delight of the Pakistani supporters. Off-spinner Graeme Swann, a quality bowler, deceived Butt in the flight to terminate a promising innings.Yardy, quicker through the air with his left-arm spin, took out Mohammed Hafeez with a change of pace.Off the very next ball – it was the 11th over of the innings – Afridi set out for a non-existent single to cover only to be sent back by Umar Akmal. The Pakistan captain could not regain his crease. England had struck a body blow.Umar Akmal, a naturally free-stroking batsman, produced a few sparkling shots but Pakistan continued to lose wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq fell to an attempted reverse sweep off Yardy. And Umar fell to a sensational catch from Pietersen at deep mid-wicket when he attempted to muscle a short ball from Sidebottom. Pietersen, running with his back to the ball, anticipated to perfection.It was his afternoon at the Kensington Oval. Pietersen was rightly adjudged Man of the Match.

Brief Scores:

Pakistan: 147 for nine in 20 overs (Salman Butt 34, Umar Akmal 30; Michael Yardy 2/19, Stuart Broad 2/25, Ryan Sidebottom 2/28).England: 148 for four in 19.3 overs (Kevin Pietersen 70 not out, Michael Lumb 25, Craig Kieswetter 25; Saeed Ajmal 2/15).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Super-Eight-England-beat-Pakistan-by-six-wickets/article16299035.ece
358,"India, Australia set for Super Eights showdown",S. Dinakar,2010-05-06,20:38:19 IST,"A confident India face a stern test when they square up against Australia in their first Super Eights clash in the World Twenty20.
  The ball flew around at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday. There was good carry for the pacemen and the bounce assisted the spin bowlers too.This suggests strong back-footed players who can unleash the horizontal bat shots and those with hands that can harness the pace on the ball could be among the runs at the famous Kensington Oval.The venue that oozes character - cricket is very much in the air in these parts - will be the stage for the crucial Super Eights clash between India and Australia on Friday.The cricketers will not be short of inspiration. The immortal Garfield Sobers enclosure stands sentinel over the ground. It will be a big game for both sides. The side, which loses the first match will, in all probability, be under tremendous pressure to win its next two encounters.Much could hinge on how the Indian top-order fares against the Australian pace battery. If Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes can be prevented from making the early inroads, India can win.Tait and Nannes form the quickest new ball combination in the competition. This is a pair of contrasts that blends well. Tait, the high velocity slinger, complements Nannes, the sharp and skiddy left-armer.Will the influential Mitchell Johnson recovers in time from an elbow injury to his non-bowling right arm. If Johnson does not play, Ryan Harris, deceptively quick, will retain his place.The Aussie gameplan will be simple - use the short-pitched deliveries to disrupt the footwork of the Indian batsmen.Tait and Nannes are likely to rely on short-pitched stuff - while only one bouncer per over is allowed, the paceman can bowl any number of deliveries that forces the batsmen to fend off rib-cage – and push the men facing them to the back-foot.They can then strike with searing yorkers. This is a ploy that has worked against India in the past. Once the Aussies score early, then the spinners, including leggie Steven Smith, could be able to bowl under less stress.In a morning match – the game starts at 9.30 a.m. local time – toss will be a factor. The side that bowls first – there will be some moisture on the surface – could starts with an advantage.Openers Gautam Gambhir and Murali Vijay, a left-right pair, face a daunting task. However, the fact that both of them can play the cut and the pull might enable them to counter-attack. Yes, the Indian batsmen will have to disrupt the length of the Aussie pacemen.The in-form Suresh Raina and his ability vis a vis the short-pitched stuff will be under the scanner. He has to remove the question mark against his name when it comes to a particular form of attack. He occupies the vital No. 3 slot.Yuvraj Singh can meet fire with fire, respond with furious hooks and pulls. The mercurial left-hander appears to be getting his confidence back.India has depth in its ranks with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni capable of orchestrating remarkable turnarounds. Yusuf Pathan can strike the ball hard and long too but he could be probed with a barrage of short-pitched deliveries.Australia, though, lacks a specialist fifth bowler. The Indians would be looking at an opportunity here. The Indian bowlers will be in with a definite chance on this surface.Australia has firepower in its batting but then its top and middle-order came apart against Bangladesh before the cool and calculative Michael Hussey came up with a worthy innings under adverse circumstances.For India, left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan should be back in the attack and the bounce will enhance his cut off the wicket. Ashish Nehra, another left-armer, has been bowling a mean length at the death.Bowling in the end overs has been an area of concern for the Indians but Nehra has been operating with heart and tact.And Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla could pose searching questions to the Aussie line-up. The spinners could be among the wickets as well.The wicket of the imposing Shane Watson would the key strike for India at the top of the order.

360,I was made a scapegoat by ICC: Samuels,IANS,2010-05-06,18:08:50 IST,"West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels feels he was made a “scapegoat” by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as he nears completion of the two-year ban for leaking team information to a bookie.In three days, Samuels will complete his ban from international cricket, and he maintains he did nothing wrong.“I am an honest person. My conscience would not allow me to come back if I knew within myself I had done something wrong,” Samuels was quoted as saying in Sydney Morning Herald.“They (ICC) need to spend time on situations like this; it is delicate and very important because you are dealing with players’ careers.”“When they looked at my case, they used me as a scapegoat, the ICC wanted to make an example out of me when I was never in a position for them to be able to use me as an example. The way they dealt with my case was very unfair,” he said.“I really didn’t have a case; when I went to the hearing I thought it would be just a fair process but it wasn’t like a hearing at all, I was just banned.”Samuels was charged with playing a part in fixing the first One-day international between India and the West Indies in Nagpur January 21, 2007. The allegations led to the ICC asking the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to conduct an investigation.At the disciplinary hearing, the committee considered evidence provided by the ICC’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) and excerpts of a recorded telephone conversation between Samuels and alleged bookie Mukesh Kochchar, which detailed vital match information being leaked by Samuels.Samuels was accused of leaking information like pitch conditions, the West Indies batting order and team strategies.The 29-year-old won’t predict if or when he might appear for the West Indies again but says: “I’ll just let my bat do the talking.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/I-was-made-a-scapegoat-by-ICC-Samuels/article16298789.ece
361,We can handle Indian spinners: Clarke,PTI,2010-05-06,15:40:55 IST,"Australian captain Michael Clarke
  On the eve of their crucial Super Eights match, Australian skipper Michael Clarke is not unduly worried by the presence of quality spinners in the Indian ranks, saying his batsmen are equipped to negotiate them.“India have got a lot of talent and they are a great side. They have some good spinners. Harbhajan is a world-class bowler. But then every team plays spinners differently and we are not perturbed. We have batsmen who can play spin pretty well. We will see how it goes tomorrow,” Clarke said.India have a flock of spinners in Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja and part-timers Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh who have proved effective in the past.The Aussie skipper though feels that spin bowling would play a big role in the tournament but sees equal opportunities for the fast bowlers and spinners as far as Friday’s clash is concerned.“Spin bowling is going to play a big part in the tournament. We saw in our win against Bangladesh that the spinners turned the ball a bit. So we can anticipate captains use their spin bowlers more often in the Twenty20 format.“The wicket here is good and the ground is wonderful. It is a lot different from the one we played in St. Lucia. But the nature of the wicket would be of no consequence as the result of the match depends on how the bowlers bowl and how the batters bat.“It depends on how the bowlers use the conditions and execute their skills. So, we are not thinking too about the wicket right now,” averred Clarke, adding “a score of 140 to 150 was defendable.”Clarke was satisfied with his team’s performance in the group matches, where Australia kept a clean slate by beating Pakistan and Bangladesh.“In the last two games we have done pretty well. We came back into the match against Bangladesh after losing six wickets for nothing. We are enjoying our cricket at the moment.Clarke said his boys were ready for the showdown in the Super Eights.“We have trained hard and our preparation has been spot on. We will focus on one match at a time and do not want to look too far into the future. We want to keep our game simple and not worry too much about what India could do,” he said.He did not rule out Mitchell Johnson, who missed the game against Bangladesh with a sore elbow, from Friday’s match.“The physio has been working on him. We will take a call on him tomorrow. But I think we have found a good replacement for him in Ryan Harris,” said Clarke.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/We-can-handle-Indian-spinners-Clarke/article16298732.ece
362,"Australia beat Bangladesh by 27 runs, qualify for Super 8s",PTI,2010-05-06,01:42:10 IST,"Australia produced a clinical performance to beat Bangladesh by 27 runs and qualify for the Super Eight stage of the Twenty20 cricket World Cup here today.The Aussies rode on Michael Hussey’s unbeaten 47 and Dirk Nannes’ four-wicket haul to drew curtains on their group campaign on unbeaten note after having defeated title holders Pakistan by 34 runs in their opening match.Australia now join Pakistan from Group A in the Super Eight stage and will take on India in their opening second round encounter on Friday.Michael Hussey played a sweet little cameo and shared crucial 74 runs with Steven Smith (27 off 18) for the seventh wicket to lift Australia to 141 for seven before Nannes (4/18) produced a breathtaking pace bowling display toNannes was ably supported by David Hussey (2/8) and Smith (2/29) at the middle.Captain Shakib Al Hasan top—scored for Bangladesh with a run-a-ball 28 while wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim (24 off 25) gave him the perfect support from the other end during their 48-run fifth-wicket partnership.Bangladesh made a mockery of their run chase as they lost four of their top-order batsmen inside the first four overs.Needing a outright win inside 19 overs to book their place in the Super Eight stage, the Bangladesh’s did not help their cause in any way and played insensible shots against some fine pace bowling to totter at 16 for four.Shain Tait (1/15)) and Nannes tested the Bangladeshi batters from the onset with their fiery and high quality fast bowling.Nannes, in particular, was the fiercesome of the duo as he picked up Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed and Mahmudullah during his three-over opening spell before returning back to account for the wicket Jahurul Islam (18).Inspite of the early jitters, Shakib and Mushfiqur put up a brave fight during their the fifth wicket to keep Bangladesh in the hunt.Shakib’s innings was finally cut short by a blinder of a catch at deep from Michael Hussey off Smith.Jahurul and Shafiul Islam (16 off 13) tried their level best to dig something out of the game but it was not to be Bangladesh’s day as Australia dished out a fantastic performance on the field to eventually romp home with eight balls to spare.Earlier opting to bat, the Aussies initially struggled as they lost six wickets for mere 65 runs before Hussey and Smith saved the day with the 42-ball vital partnership.After the initial hiccup, the Aussies added 59 runs in the last five overs, courtesy some fine hitting from Hussey and Smith.Australia did not have the ideal start to their innings as Shane Watson (4) feel early with Mashrafe Mortaza (2/28) striking in his second and innings’ third over.Watson mistimed a pull of Mortaza’s well-directed bouncer that landed in the hands of Ahmed.Captain Shakib (2/24) then ensured double celebrations for Bangladesh in the next over, picking up dangerman David Warner (16 off 11), caught by Ahmed.And then few overs later, a reckless shot from Brad Haddin ensured further trouble for Australia. He was easily caught by Shafiul off left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak (1/29) as he went for a lofted sweep over square leg.As if that was not enough, skipper Michael Clarke (16) was the next to depart, caught at long-off boundary by Jahurul off Ashraful (1/24) to see Australia stutter at 54 for four at the halfway mark.It could have been more trouble the Aussies had Jahurul not dropped a David Hussey sitter off Ashraful’s next ball.But Mortaza ensured that Bangladesh did not have to pay heavily for the dropped chance, picking up David Hussey in the next over to mark the departure of half of the Aussie side.Another well-directed bouncer from Mortaza hurried David Hussey into the pull, but the batsman could not control the shot and ballooned it to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur.Cameron White too failed to make any impact as Shakib outsmarted him with a lovely leg-spinner that turned away crashed onto his timbers.With chips down, Michael Hussey and Smith first played sensibly with ones and twos before opening up in the final five overs to take Australia to the fighting total.Michael Hussey took the onus on him to guide the Australia innings and picked up the tempo with a 17-run over off Mortaza. He hit as many as four fours and six during his 29-bal unbeaten stay.Smith too was not far behind as he used his long handle to great affect in the dying stages to register two sixes and a boundary against his name.

Brief Scores:

Australia: 141 for seven in 20 overs (Michael Hussey 47, Steven Smith 27; Mashrafe Mortaza 2/28, Shakib Al Hasan 2/24).Bangladesh: 114 all out in 18.4 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 28, Mushfiqur Rahim 24; Dirk Nannes 4/18).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Australia-beat-Bangladesh-by-27-runs-qualify-for-Super-8s/article16298627.ece

  | Photo Credit: K_Ananthan With campus placements improving and the economy looking up in the “spill-over” days of the recession, one would have thought that those who are about to start their undergraduate course will be happy about this trend and go with the flow.But, the student crowd that thronged The Hindu Education Plus Education Fair 2010, held for the first time in Coimbatore on Wednesday, told an entirely different story. Even with fairly good jobs and quality education in India, the 2,500-odd visitors to the fair stood testimony to the fact that studying abroad still remained a craze.Though the favourites of the day were Information Technology, engineering, biotechnology, management, and animation, there were universities and academies offering courses from dance and aviation to medicine and health studies, which too drew many enquiries. Of the 2,500, there were more than 1,200 students who registered, showing their earnestness about the course and university they were interested in.For such an enthusiastic turnout, the fair with 30-odd stalls comprising universities, educational consultants, and a bank, turned out to be a boon, offering options with many countries, universities, and courses, to choose from. Students and parents had to wait their turn at each stall to talk to representatives.A parent said she had to talk to representatives in most of the stalls because all the participants were genuine and not institutions which were of run-of-the-mill quality.The University of Bradford, the U.K., with its bachelors, masters' and research programmes in health studies, informatics, and life sciences, Birmingham City University, the U.K., with its job-ready vocational programmes in automotive, and mechanical engineering, and Stratford University, the U.S., with its special focus on telecommunications and software engineering, were a big draw.University of Alabama, Huntsville, the U.S., was promoting the two five-year integrated programmes for undergraduates – Mechanical Aerospace Engineering, and Business Management. Representatives of RACUS, a private organisation representing Russian State universities, said the universities were offering medical and dental courses for 20 per cent of the total fee. “The Russian Government bears 80 per cent of the fee for international students,” Maria Postolovskaya, said. Hence, a candidate with only 50 per cent aggregate and with no GRE score could do a course in medicine, dentistry, business management, or engineering, in a Russian State university.Just like any other stall, eager parents swarmed the stall put up by State Bank of India (SBI) keen to know about the education loans available for students going abroad.S. Venkataraman, Regional Manager, Region I, SBI, said for students going abroad the loan amount went up to Rs. 20 lakh at 11.75 per cent interest. “This will be given against a collateral. Students get a grace period of a year on completion of the course. After that they are given a seven-year repayment period,” he said. Many walked out with the options they needed to make the right decisions to join the bandwagon of Indians studying abroad.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Ardour-for-going-abroad-for-higher-studies-still-in-vogue/article16298590.ece

367,"Water supply erratic, say residents",Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,00:30:15 IST,"Residents of T.N. Chinnaswamy Avenue in Ward 1 of the Coimbatore Corporation say they are going the worst time yet in terms of drinking water supply under the Pilloor scheme for over two months.The layout is among the many that fall under the North and East zones of the Corporation that are struggling for water.Official sources say that with the bulk of the city's new regularised layouts located in these zones, the residential colonies have been pushed into a phase of scarcity from that of abundance.The areas coming under the Pilloor scheme were envied by those in the Siruvani scheme areas because the former enjoyed a sustained allocation of 65 million litres a day throughout the year. But, the monsoon determined the quantity of supply in the Siruvani areas.But, the residents in Wards 1 and 2 say that water adequacy was a thing of the past. Now, it is a tough struggle.“Every day, at least 10 women walk to the Corporation's overhead tank near our colony in a desperate search for water,” says secretary of T.N. Chinnaswamy Avenue Welfare Association K. Ramachandran.Ward 1 councillor K. Chandrasekar says: “It 13 days (till May 4) since we got water supply. When we take this up with the Corporation water supply staff or officials, they cite power shutdown as the reason. Three hours of power cut has a direct effect on the areas where water has to be pumped to from the water tank.”Ward 2 councillor D. Jothimani too has a similar complaint. “We get water only once in 10 days,” she says. “And, there is no solution to this problem though we have taken it up with the water supply wing of the civic body.”Mr. Chandrasekar wonders how Avarampalayam gets water once in five days and not Wards 1 and 2 that were not very far away.Mr. Ramachandran says the residents are even more upset with the water supply staff for not informing of the probable supply time.“The supply is made at 11 p.m. If we know of this in advance, we can stay awake. Otherwise, we will never know of the supply.”Even in the case of disruption in Pilloor supply because of problems in the supply line such as leaks of bursts, the residents say that they should know when the supply will be restored in their respective layouts after the supply in the main line is restored.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Water-supply-erratic-say-residents/article16298584.ece

But since it is a special city being the Capital of the country and has a large diplomatic corps, there is a strong need to modernise the force.

A multipurpose galvanised iron wire now stands tall as a farmer with a plough on his shoulders. At another corner of the wall, a piece of thermocol has been turned into an exquisite clay model of Radha-Krishna, imitating art on wood complete with fine engravings.The clay used to mould these three-dimensional figures is unique. Unlike normal clay models, which develop cracks, do not have solidity and need to be ‘fired' in a kiln, this clay does not require any special treatment.To top it off, it is eco-friendly and no chemicals have been used in its preparation.The studio of artist K. Muralidhar at Sindhi Colony has loads of such astonishing clay models, moulded by using things which are usually discarded to a bust-bin.The empty box of a talcum powder now has a clay face on it and can be used as a paperweight. A used towel has been expertly moulded, by using the clay, into wavy curls of a woman.“Such artwork is usually done with plaster of Paris, cement or adhesives like an M.seal”. Normal clay does not bind and cracks develop immediately. I have prepared this eco-friendly clay without any chemicals. The colours being used in the artwork are also natural,” says Muralidhar.To prove the environment friendly nature of his clay, Muralidhar grows decorative plants at his art studio, by using the clay, in small pots. The artist has done lot of research on how to prevent clay models from developing cracks, make them light weight and without using furnace or a kiln to heat.“I have used grounded cotton powder to prevent cracks and wood powder to make clay light in weight,” he reveals. The clay is soluble and artworks can be recycled by dipping in water. “If you are not happy by the finished artwork, just dip it in water and start again,” he says.

Chandrashekhar,2010-05-06,00:24:08 IST,"The drinking water situation in rural areas across the State is alarming due to depletion of water availability and drying up of sources.Authorities of the Rural Water Supply Department admit that about 38 lakh people in nearly 3,000 habitations, mostly in Telangana region, are facing drinking water scarcity.Some district Collectors, at whose disposal the State government has kept sufficient funds to tie over the situation, have been found wanting in taking the call to meet the demand in several districts. As a result, people in most of the affected habitations are being forced to manage with a meagre supply of 15 litres per capita per day (LPCD) against the WHO-standard requirement of 40 LPCD.“The WHO norm means water requirement of a person for all his needs in a day. But, we (RWS Department) are supplying water only for drinking and cooking needs”, officials of the department argued. Summer has put severe stress on water sources resulting in 154 protected water supply schemes becoming defunct and 15,009 borewells getting seasonal.When contacted, Deputy Chief Engineer of RWS B. Surender Reddy told The Hindu on Tuesday that drinking water was being transported to 2,939 habitations as on May 4 due to shortfall in yield (1,091), drying up and depletion in the water quality (1,831) and power supply problem (17). Need of 1,831 habitations was being met by hiring private sources like agricultural borewells.Shortfall in water yield in sources was high in Chittoor (374 habitations), Karimnagar (115), Srikakulam (110), Adilabad (81), Krishna (65), Kadapa (53), Warangal (46), Medak (41), Nizamabad (39) and Khammam (31), whereas drying up of sources and depletion in quality was more in Warangal (902), Chittoor (499), Nalgonda (310), Karimnagar (282), Medak (151), Adilabad (132), Nizamabad (119), Kadapa (117), Srikakulam (113) and Khammam (71), he explained.Shortage of staff has also become a bottleneck in meeting the demand in some districts like Nizamabad, where only 15 per cent of the sanctioned strength was available. Of the a sum of Rs. 57.53 crore released to Collectors for taking up contingency measures in scarcity habitations only Rs.16,67 crore has been utilised so far. Besides, Rs. 25 lakh each legislators' ACDP fund has also been allocated for the purpose.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3000-habitations-face-water-scarcity/article16298578.ece
375,Bringing back a cultural metaphor,J. S. Ifthekhar,2010-05-06,00:22:50 IST,"Years roll back and time seems to stand still. Hyderabad's founder, Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, reclines on his throne with the royal guards in attendance. The poets are seated in a semi-circle on spotless white ‘chandnees'. The air is rife with expectation as the ‘shama' is placed before a poet.Yes, one is transported back in time as a typical mushaira of the Quli Qutb Shah days comes alive. Mushairas figure at the top on the cultural calendar of Hyderabad, but this one is different. It is a throwback to the olden times when aesthetic values had not yielded place to crass commercialisation.An earnest attempt was made the other day by artistes belonging to “Aiwan-e-Fankar” to bring back the glory of mushairas of yore. They tried to trace the journey of the ‘ghazal', capturing the typical ambience, the rich blend of thought and feelings. Not just this. Artistes donned period costumes complete with flowing beards and long tresses to play the roles of great poets like Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Daag, Jigar, Hasrat Mohani down to the recent greats like Shaz Tamkanat and Maqdoom Mohiuddin.For most part, the history of Urdu poetry is the story of the Urdu ghazal. But the current generation brought up on MTV has neither the taste nor interest to appreciate the nuances of shayari. “We want to present the greatest of Urdu poets in their original style. And also to show how mushairas were actually held earlier,” says Javeed Kamal, the man behind ‘Tamseeli mushaira'.Sure, this is a fairly good attempt to revive interest in the institution of mushaira. Interestingly, it seeks to treat the audience with the best of Urdu ghazals from the best writers of the genre. Mr. Kamal has shot the two-hour concert and it will be soon available in CD format. Urdu lovers can now watch the legendary poets recite from the comfort of their homes.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Bringing-back-a-cultural-metaphor/article16298576.ece

377,Traumatic moments for kin of rag-pickers,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,00:20:12 IST,"As four poclains rummaged through the mountains of garbage at the Jawaharnagar dumping yard, rag-picker Shanmuga sat there silently praying that his son is found alive.His son, Vaasu, along with two others, Khaja, 15, and Mohd. Raheem, 22, got buried alive under the heaps of garbage three days ago. Shanmuga believed that some miracle would bring back his son alive. His hopes were shattered as a poclain operator stumbled upon a severed body.Families of the three victims ran there to see who it was. Shanmuga collapsed on seeing that the severed body was that of his son, recognising it by the colour of the trousers and innerwear that he last wore.“Probably, the huge steel hook of the poclain hit the body severing it,” the police said. Vaasu was the only son of Shanmuga. His mother died few years ago. Theirs was one of the nearly 100 rag-picking families living near the yard, picking plastic from garbage and selling it for recycling.Shanmuga cried inconsolably on seeing his son's body refusing to leave the place till his son's head was found. The police sent him away convincing him that searches in the night would not be helpful. Family members of Raheem and Khaja too underwent equally tense moments as the bodies of their beloved ones could not be traced.Sania, wife of Raheem, went to Moosarambagh on Monday to see her ailing mother when she learnt that her husband got trapped in the garbage. They got married a year ago. The shell-shocked woman sat at the yard as searches continued for the last two days.Officials restricted rag-pickers from entering the dumping yard when a rag-picking woman, Nagamma, 42, died after heaps of garbage fell on her 10 days ago. “This meant no work and no food for us. Apparently, my son Khaja was worried about the family's fate and ventured into the yard in the night looking for plastic along with the other two,” Khaja's mother Sabera Begum said.

378,EAMCET: certificate verification to begin early,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,00:19:17 IST,"Officials are toying with the idea of verifying the certificates of EAMCET aspirants soon after the results are released instead of waiting till the actual process of counselling starts.The idea is to cut down the time and ensure that certification is not done in a hurry. This year the announcement of final ranks is likely to be delayed and done only in the second week of July. Officials want to announce the results taking into consideration the marks obtained in the re-verification of scripts and recounting of marks obtained in the advanced supplementary examinations.Officials said since verification of certificates has nothing to do with ranks obtained they want to advance the process. Last year, verification was done in 59 helpline centres across the State, and this year the number may be increased as new centres have been added in two more districts.If a final decision is taken the process is likely to start in June second week after the marks of EAMCET are announced.

  | Photo Credit: G_Karthikeyan With effective intervention of government hospitals and good support and coordination from the NGOs and Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres, the rate of spreading of HIV among people had come down to 0.025 per cent from 1.36 per cent, said T. Jayabal, Joint Director of Health Services.He was addressing an AIDS awareness seminar meant for HIV affected persons, nurses and volunteers held here on Wednesday.Approximately four million people have been living with HIV in the world including in African countries, top in the world in having highest number of HIV patients. India's position was number two in this list but it was number one in controlling the disease.Dindigul district alone had over 8,000 persons living with HIV. Only 3,411 patients had registered with Anti-Retroviral Therapy Centre of which 1,678 patients got regular treatment. Besides, 89 children too were also treated at the ART centre, Dr. Jayabal pointed out. The Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society had offered Rs.1.38 lakh to meet their educational needs, he added.He appealed to all persons living with HIV to register their names with the ART centre and avail its care and support services. The non-governmental organisations, volunteers and village health nurses should strive hard to include those who had not registered their names with the ART centre.Early detection of HIV, prompt diagnosis and treatment would certainly ensure reduction of morbidity and mortality of the infected and quality of life of the affected could also be improved. Effective management of the disease would also help delay the progression of the disease. The ART centre in Dindigul GH had all facilities and equipments required to test the patients. Patients need not go to Madurai for diagnosis and tests. The GH had even a legal cell for AIDS patients to protect their rights, he added.In his special address, Tamil Nadu Health System Project Coordinator A. Asai Thambi said that persons aged below 50 years alone were mostly affected by AIDS. Weakening the youth population will have a direct impact on the economic development and growth of the nation, he added.Speakers stated that HIV cases were on the rise in Oddanchatram, Nilakottai and Batlagundu.

381,High Court staff see light at the end of the tunnel,Mohamed Imranullah S.,2010-05-06,02:23:22 IST,"Madras High Court employees here demanded an exclusive housing colony in 2004; works for identifying the land began in 2005 and officials zeroed in on a 3.7-acre site opposite to the Maatuthavani Integrated bus terminus in 2006.Thereafter, a building plan was drawn in 2007 for constructing 16 ‘A' type apartments, 48 ‘B' type, 112 ‘C' type and 96 ‘D' type apartments along with a play area and other amenities. Nevertheless, there was a slump in the progress of the project for a year.In June 2008, a Lok Adalat comprising the Law Minister Durai Murugan, the then Chief Justice of the High Court A.K. Ganguly and the then Chairman of the Law Commission AR. Lakshmanan directed the Government to complete the project, preferably, by the end of year.A few months thereafter, it was announced that the construction would be taken up by the Public Works Department (PWD) instead of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). A foundation stone laying ceremony was held at Court Hall No.1 of the High Court Bench on November 1, 2008.The PWD, in February 2009, submitted a revised estimate to the Government to hike the project cost from Rs.19.38 crore to Rs.25.2 crore in view of escalation in prices of construction materials and considering the changes made by the High Court to the original building plan.The court had insisted on leaving vehicle parking space in the ground floor. Therefore, it was decided to construct four-storey buildings instead of three-storeys as it was planned originally. The sanction for the revised estimate got delayed due to the Parliamentary elections.After three months, a Government Order was issued in June 2009 granting sanction for Rs.25.2 crore.Subsequently, the PWD kickstarted the process of calling for tenders for various works and finalised the contractors even as the High Court staff waited with bated breath.At last, the court employees were able to see some light at the end of the tunnel on Monday when the officials brought a set of bricks and a bag of sand to the construction site, for the first time, to conduct a ‘bhoomi puja' .Having waited for nearly six years, the staff now only hope and pray that the buildings would come up within 15 to 18 months without any further delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/High-Court-staff-see-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/article16298653.ece
382,Vaiko voices concern over dam issue,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,02:20:16 IST,"Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko on Wednesday criticised the Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi, for not allowing Parvathiammal, mother of Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam leader, V. Prabhakaran, to enter Tamil Nadu to get medical treatment.He was addressing a public meeting here to highlight the proposed agitation blocking all roads leading to Kerala on May 28.Reacting to Mr. Karunanidhi's contention that he was not aware of Ms. Parvathiammal landing at Chennai airport, Mr. Vaiko questioned how a huge posse of police personnel was deployed at the airport before the flight could land. “Did the police come there without the Chief Minister's knowledge? Why did the police block me and P. Nedumaran (convenor of Mullaperiyar Dam Rights Retrieval Committee) from entering the airport though we had visitors' pass with us,” he said.He also condemned Mr. Karunanidhi for his argument that Ms. Parvathiammal was denied entry into Tamil Nadu as she was blacklisted by the Centre based on a recommendation made by the former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa. “If Ms. Parvathiammal was blacklisted, the Indian embassy in Malaysia could not have issued her a visa enabling her to visit India,” Mr. Vaiko said.Mr. Karunadhi always had the liberty to reverse the previous Government's decision on allowing Ms. Parvathiammal, considering her condition, he said. He sought an apology from the Centre and the State for their “inhuman” act against an ailing aged woman.On the dam issue, Mr. Vaiko said he had little hope that the Supreme Court could render justice to Tamil Nadu. He said that people of Tamil Nadu could not nurture any faith on the apex court that had reversed its own three-member bench verdict on the dam row by constituting a five-member committee to study the stability of the structure. He wondered what the panel was going to do after two Central committees had certified the stability of the dam and after which the Supreme Court allowed the level to be raised to 142 feet.He wanted the people of Tamil Nadu to participate in large numbers in the May 28 road roko in the interest of the future generations of the five districts benefited by Periyar dam. “If we failed to check Kerala Government in its plan to decommission the dam, these districts would become a desert,” he said.Mr. Nedumaran said that the Chief Minister could have put pressure on the Centre to implement the Supreme Court verdict on the dam issue citing the unrest caused in the State by the Opposition parties.Communist Party of India's State deputy secretary, C. Mahendran, warned that nationalism should ensure that every citizen was equally treated.

383,Pudhurai Vannars seek community certificates,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,02:16:12 IST,"For a few members belonging to the Pudhirai Vannar caste, obtaining community certificates has become more than an uphill task. The members have been running from pillar to post for months together representing their case in the grievance meetings but all in vain.S.Pechiammal and M.Alagarsamy of Pudhupatti, A .Muruganandam, Ettimangalam near Melur, K.Murugan, Keeraithurai and V.Murugan, Vavval Thottam have submitted petitions to the Adi Dravidar Tribal Welfare Minister, District Collector and Revenue Divisional Officer.V.Murugan, member, Tamil Nadu Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board, says “for the above said members of Pudhirai Vannar caste it is stated so in their school certificates but community certificates are not issued to them.” When enquired in the office of Adi Dravidar Welfare Department, all that Murugan and his fellow caste members were told was that it was stopped 15 years ago.The community members alleged that certificates were given randomly; in most cases, anyone among the family holds a certificate but when asked for others in the family the authorities are reluctant to issue them.According to government records, the Pudhirai Vannars are one among the 76 Scheduled Castes. The name, Pudhirai Vannar, is listed 60th in the Tamil Nadu list of Scheduled Castes, as laid out by the Scheduled Castes (Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into effect from July 27, 1977.However, the state authorities do not easily issue community certificates in the name of Puthirai Vannars. Mr.Murugan has in fact raised this issue during the first meeting held at Chennai on January 28, after the establishment of a separate “Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board” G.O. No.114.The members said that it was great that the State had established a board and provided Rs.50 lakh for the year 2009–2010 to extend relief to the needy registered members of the board.All this is welcome but we need community certificates to get a sense of belongingness to our own caste identity, they alleged. Pudhirai Vannars remain as a caste that can be referred to as victims of ‘multiple marginalisation' who provide services to Dalits.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Pudhurai-Vannars-seek-community-certificates/article16298650.ece

  | Photo Credit: Bijoy Ghosh The Murugappa Group has set itself a turnover of target of over $7 billion to be hit by 2013-14. At present, the group has a turnover of $3.03 billion.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, A. Vellayan, Executive Chairman of the group, said each business unit of the group had worked out a strategy to grow at 24 per cent annually. With the country's GDP (gross domestic product) projected to grow at 8 per cent, Mr. Vellayan felt that the sales target was achievable. He said all the business units were looking to grow three times the GDP.The group's turnover for 2009-10 dropped by 14 per cent from Rs. 15,907 crore to Rs. 13,617 crore, mainly due to a sharp drop in the prices of key inputs for Coromandel International Ltd., the Executive Chairman said. Coromandel reported a 32 per cent decline in its turnover at Rs. 6,431 crore, the biggest sales drop among the group companies.Notwithstanding the setback on the turnover front, the Murugappa Group reported a 22 per cent jump in EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation) at Rs. 1,879 crore against Rs. 1,535 crore. The profit before tax (excluding extraordinary income) of the group grew by 29 per cent to Rs. 1,354 crore from Rs. 1,054 crore.Mr. Vellayan said that the group was able to ride the wave of economic rebound powered by enterprise-wide efficiency. EID Parry, he said, had increased its daily cane crushing capacity to 32,500 tonnes (along with 150 MW co-generation power and 230 kl alcohol) by acquiring Sadashiva Sugars in Karnataka and GMR Industries, which have plants in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The sugar refinery at Kakinada was expected to start operations this month, he added.Besides sugar, Mr. Vellayan indicated that fertilizers and engineering could be key growth areas for the group in the coming years. “With favourable growth outlook for auto and commercial vehicles sector, we see a growth potential of 20 per cent,” said N. Srinivasan, Director (Finance), Murugappa Group.Mr. Vellayan admitted that the group's foray into China was not a good experience. While the group closed its tube operations, it pulled out of the abrasive joint venture in China.On the challenges being faced on the HR front in the wake of entry of MNCs and big industrial houses from across the country into Tamil Nadu, he said “We have seven home grown CEOs heading the group companies. The management development centre conducts leadership and business development programmes.”",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/Murugappa-Group-profit-up-29-per-cent-at-Rs.-1350-crore/article16298863.ece

Customer research has already shown that BMW is the strongest premium car brand and we hope to keep this customer confidence intact and grow even faster,” Dr. Schaaf added.Dr. Schaaf, who has completed his doctoral thesis and studied business administration at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, has come to head BMW's India operations after a successful stint as the Vice-President of BMW Group Korea with responsibility of sales and marketing. Before joining BMW Group Korea, he was the head of market development for the region Asia, Pacific, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe.On the other hand, Mr. Kronschnabl will be leading the German carmaker's Russia operations, where the company enjoys the leadership position. Since BMW India's inception in 2006, Mr. Kronschnabl not only built the BMW brand, setting up sales and service networks, but also took the Munich-headquartered company to the numero uno position. “I wish and hope that BMW India grows even faster… BMW is not just a brand, it's a philosophy,” he said in his farewell message.In 2009, BMW overtook Mercedes as the top luxury carmaker in the Indian market with sales of 3,619 units. Its market share in the luxury segment has crossed 40 per cent against just 9 per cent in 2006. With its recent launch of new 5 Series sedan in India, the luxury carmaker is upbeat on its sales.In 2010, the company has set even more ambitious target of achieving the sales of 4,000-units, besides expanding its network, taking the brand to Tier-II and Tier-III cities.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/BMW-India-hopes-to-retain-top-position/article16298864.ece

Consumer prices in India, particularly of food, have “remained stubbornly high”, it said while pointing to the Consumer Price Index (for industrial workers) which rose to nearly 9 per cent in 2008 and further to 12 per cent in 2009. “A faster increase in food prices has become a cause of concern,” it said.Turning to the South Asian economies, ESCAP expressed concern over the high deficits in some countries owing to the expansionary policies to counter the impact of the global financial crisis. “It is important that governments in the sub-region prepare a clear road map for fiscal consolidation to be implemented at the earliest to contain growing public debt…Yet another challenge is to manage portfolio capital inflows, mainly by FIIs that are leading to build-up of bubbles in capital markets and putting upward pressure on the exchange rates,” the report said.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ESCAP-projects-8.3-GDPgrowth-for-India-this-fiscal/article16298857.ece

402,Mauritius elections hold promise for India,Pranay Gupte,2010-05-06,23:23:21 IST,"Mauritius Prime Minister Navin Ramgoomam cast his vote at a polling booth in Vacoas town, Mauritius. File Photo: AP
  Now that the three-party alliance of Navin Ramgoolam has won 41 of the 60 seats in the Mauritius national Parliament — more than double the number of Paul Berenger's leftist Mouvement Militant Mauricien — there is general agreement that the 63-year-old former physician and lawyer has obtained a powerful mandate to implement economic and social reforms in his second consecutive term as this island-nation's Prime Minister.Some of those reforms eluded him during his first term; indeed, a few unpopular measures that Mr. Ramgoolam introduced — such as a national residential property tax, and another tax on interest from savings — spurred flight of capital in certain circles. The expectation is that such measures will be reviewed and possibly eliminated.The Prime Minister has also pledged a more aggressive “democratisation” of the economy — ensuring, among other things, that ownership of the vast sugarcane plantations that are currently controlled by the minority whites of French descent is also made accessible to other communities in this country of 1.3 million people dominated by Hindus. Creoles, Christians and Muslims also compromise larger sections of the demographic cohort than the Francos. A special “democratisation unit” has been formed in the Prime Minister's office, and its workload is certain to be amplified.Mr. Ramgoolam's election victory has also brought relief to several business supporters who had been targeted by Mr. Berenger and his financial backers. They had been apprehensive that the Berenger group would subvert, if not entirely destroy, their commerce.
Opposition claim
The 65-year-old Mr. Berenger, silver-haired and wearing an open-necked blue shirt, appeared at a gathering of followers early on Thursday evening and promised to continue “fighting the good fight”, and promised to work toward national unity. He was gracious about the Prime Minister's victory — a sentiment not necessarily appreciated by many in his audience — but asserted that the elections were neither free nor fair. Mr. Berenger chided the national television network for blatantly favouring the Prime Minister's alliance in order to ensure its victory.The Ramgoolam alliance's victory, however, will most definitely be welcomed by India, not the least because Mauritius contributes $12 billion in foreign direct investment to India, by far the biggest annual FDI from any country. Mr. Berenger — a former Prime Minister himself — while publicly proclaiming his fidelity to an “umbilical relationship” with India, has been known to privately express a desire for strengthened commercial and political relations with France and other Western powers.India's Chief Election Commissioner Navin Chawla has been here for the last several days at the invitation of the government. He was not an official observer, of course, but other Indian representatives in Mauritius must feel emboldened now to suggest stronger technical, educational and computer-science links between both countries. They are surely mindful of the disappointment of influential Mauritian business leaders that such ties were not deepened by India in the last few years.But they are also mindful that Mr. Ramgoolam enjoys a warm personal rapport with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. On Thursday, therefore, there were renewed expectations that Mr. Ramgoolam's new term could usher in an era characterised by enhanced bilateral economic and political relations.Those expectations took into account a public position by Mr. Ramgoolam that the Indian Ocean coral atoll of Diego Garcia — part of the Chagos Archipelago — would be turned over to Mauritius by the United States, which has maintained a large military base there since a 1971 secret agreement with the British Labour government of then Prime Minister Harold Wilson. That agreement called for Diego Garcia to be leased to the U.S.; the military base has been used by Washington for missile launches and naval operations against suspected terrorist havens in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and also parts of Africa.Some Indian critics have long felt that the American presence on Diego Garcia represented a form of political hegemony in the Indian Ocean, territory that ordinarily should be viewed as within India's sphere of influence.Mr. Ramgoolam has also suggested that Mauritius co-administer Tromelin Island, currently a French territory.
Concern for India
But one major issue of concern to India that may crop up during his new administration is that of China's growing economic presence in Mauritius, and its ambition to widen political influence throughout Africa. For example, China is building a new palm-frond-shaped airport here; it is also creating an industrial city from where goods will be re-exported to Africa and Europe.It is not that Mr. Ramgoolam is particularly wooing China, although its contribution to the local economy has been welcomed. It is India that has lagged in taking timely advantage of the economic opportunities available in a country of high literacy and aspirations to become a high-tech centre for the region.Such geopolitical considerations, of course, were not quite the stuff of the main conversations on Thursday in Mauritius as the election results poured in, and the winners celebrated at rallies while losers lamented without seeming to be grieving. Politics, after all, is not only about democracy, it is also about deportment.There was wide delight that Mr. Ramgoolam's second term would represent stability and continuity — his trusted lieutenant, Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun won from his constituency in the capital of Port Louis, in what had been a race made difficult and ugly by his opponent.It was also noted that, in addition to Paul Berenger's general political loss, the opposition front bench had been considerably weakened by the defeat of three of his closest aides. The craggy old leftist has now only his own shoulders to lean on, at least in Parliament. But who said politics was fair?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Mauritius-elections-hold-promise-for-India/article16298868.ece

  Auctioneers Christie's is facing a bitter compensation claim after a drawing it sold for £11,400 as a 19th-century German picture is claimed, actually, to be a 15th-century Leonardo da Vinci worth £100 million.The picture's original owner, Jeanne Marchig, who runs a U.K. foundation for animal welfare, is accusing the auction-house of negligence, alleging that it misattributed the drawing. She claims that, in failing to “exercise due care”, it sold the artwork for a “fraction” of its true value, according to a complaint filed in the Manhattan federal court.The drawing, a profile of a girl, is now on exhibition in Gothenberg, Sweden, as a Da Vinci. Ms Marchig is seeking unspecified damages, but court papers seen by the Guardian show her lawyer wants a substantial figure. They say the drawing is insured for more than $100 million and that its value exceeds $150 million.Ms Marchig was “devastated” when she discovered last July — in a call from Christie's — that the Da Vinci scholar Martin Kemp had hailed the portrait as La Bella Principessa, a depiction of Bianca Sforza, daughter of the Duke of Milan. The court papers assert that there is ample evidence that it is a Da Vinci. They mention a faint fingerprint, which matches that on a painting by Da Vinci, and carbon tests indicating dates from 1440 to 1650, not the 19th century. Christie's is accused of failure to use scientific methods and technology.But other experts are unconvinced of the attribution. Jacques Franck, the Da Vinci consultant at UCLA, told the Guardian on Wednesday: “It's not Leonardo's hand. The drawing presents anatomical mistakes, notably the link between the neck and the bust.” A Christie's spokesman said: “Christie's strongly disagrees with these claims and believes they are without merit.” — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Legal-battle-over-ldquoda-Vincirdquo/article16298867.ece
404,Kabul unveils plan to disarm militants,Jon Boone,2010-05-06,23:22:49 IST,"Afganistan President Hamid Karzai
  Top Taliban leaders could be offered exile outside Afghanistan if they agree to stop fighting the government of Hamid Karzai, a long-expected peace plan by the Afghan government will propose later this month.The far-reaching proposals, seen by the Guardian, also call for “deradicalisation” classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs created for foot soldiers who renounce violence.The long-delayed Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme has emerged just as Mr. Karzai prepares to go to Washington for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama, where the issue is likely to be top of the agenda.The plan will then be presented later in the month to a gathering of representatives from across Afghanistan called the National Consultative Peace Jirga. Once agreed upon, the government will be able to start spending around $160 million pledged by the international community to lure fighters away from the conflict. The document refers to such fighters as “angry brothers”, reflecting the belief that a substantial portion of insurgents are not motivated by strong ideological beliefs.Little is said in the report about the Taliban leaders managing the war against Mr. Karzai's government. However, it does say insurgent leaders could face “potential exile in a third country”.Saudi Arabia has been used in the past for such purposes, and there has been widespread speculation that exile could be offered to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hizb-e-Islami armed group, which in March sent a peace delegation to Kabul for talks with Mr. Karzai.Western powers are likely to be pleased by the level of detail about the new High Level Peace Council, which will take over from a notoriously chaotic predecessor body accused of reintegrating fighters who subsequently took up arms again.However, diplomats are worried that the government lacks the capacity to implement a programme that calls for complex activities in around 4,000 villages most affected by the insurgency. One diplomat said: “For the international community money is not a problem, they will pay whatever it takes. One gets a sense that there are people on the military side who will do most of the work and then give it some sort of an Afghan face.” The High Council and its executive body will be in charge of processing fighters who want to live peacefully. They will initially be put in “demobilisation centres” for a “cooling off” period of 90 days where their needs can be assessed and their personal security assured.If they agree to lay down their arms and cut ties with al Qaeda they will be entitled to an amnesty against prosecution for any crimes they may have committed. They will also be issued with a biometric “reintegration card”. They will then be offered a “menu” of options designed to keep them peacefully occupied, including vocational training in such trades as carpet-weaving and tailoring.There will also be the option to go through “deradicalisation” training, of the sort pioneered by Saudi Arabia. However, the report acknowledges the complexity of such programmes, the lack of “adequate experience” in Afghanistan and the likely need to send “highly radicalised” people to other countries for treatment.Major new institutions will also be set up to manage enormous job-creation schemes. An Engineering and Construction Corps will focus on labour-intensive work, such as the construction of Afghanistan's national highway system and other large-scale infrastructure projects. It also envisages teams of ex-Taliban fighters being rapidly deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and landslides. By far the most controversial option is the option for former insurgents to join the Afghan Army or police force. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Kabul-unveils-plan-to-disarm-militants/article16298866.ece
405,Lula and the Brazilian moment,Jorge Heine,2010-05-06,23:04:43 IST,"Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil. File Photo: AP
  T
ime magazine has just named President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the world's most influential leader. Barack Obama is ranked fourth. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is 19th (there are only four heads of state or government in the list). This is an exercise somewhat different from the traditional “Person of the Year” selection Time engages in each December, but highly revealing nonetheless. It is defined as “not about the influence of power, but about the power of influence.” Time has never selected a Latin American leader as person of the year. In India, Mahatma Gandhi made it in 1930.Brazil, once known as “the country of the future” that would always remain as such, has come a long way. That this should happen at the close of the eight-year presidency of the leader of the Brazilian Workers party (the PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores), whose very election prospects in 2002 led to a run on the real, the Brazilian currency, and BOVESPA, the Sao Paulo stock market, is striking.What is the secret of Lula and Brazil's success? How come a country best known until 20 years ago for its runaway inflation and rollercoaster economy has made it its present condition an investors' darling, that applies highly effective social policies, and that has positioned itself as a veto player in international affairs, one without whose acquiescence no major global initiative is viable?With a land mass of some 8.5 million square kilometres, the world's fifth largest, comparable to the continental United States, Brazil is more a continent than country. With a population of 190 million, and growing fast, it is not quite in the same league as China and India (which is why some people said there were “only two BRICs in the wall”), but is still the fifth most populated country. More than one out of three Latin Americans is Brazilian. With a GDP approaching $2 trillion, it is the eighth largest economy.Yet, Brazil's size has been immense ever since its independence in the 19th century, whereas its rise to the frontlines of international affairs has taken place only in the past 20 years. Why?The answer is simple: presidential leadership. Most would be hard-pressed to name a Brazilian president from the 1960s to the 1990s. For 20 years the country was run by obscure generals, and in 1985, with the return of democracy, by lacklustre civilians, who did little to combat the runaway inflation and the deep imbalances in one of the most unequal societies in the world.Lula has done a remarkable job, but he stands on the shoulders of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994-2002). It was as the improbable Minister for Finance of President Itamar Franco in 1993 that Cardoso, a sociologist, made his mark. He was the author of the Plan Real that brought inflation under control, and launched him all the way to Planalto, the presidential palace in Brasilia. Much like 1991 was a turnaround year in India, when under Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the country started to liberalise and open up its economy, 1993 was such a year in Brazil, and it has never looked back.Cardoso realised that Brazil needed not just to stabilise its currency but also to open up and deregulate its economy, stifled by decades of rampant protectionism. He privatised state enterprises, opened the doors for FDI and pushed business into export markets. Whereas in 1990 foreign trade reached 11 per cent of the GDP, it is now at 24 per cent. Whereas until 1990 Brazil attracted less than $1 billion a year in FDI, today it is, after China, the country in the developing world that attracts the most, reaching as much as $40 billion a year in recent times.By stabilising the polity and the economy (Brazil had four presidents from 1985 to 1994), Cardoso in his eight years did much to clear the underbrush for Lula. And despite all the criticism Lula had voiced from the opposition against Cardoso's alleged “neoliberal” policies, once he took office in January 2003, he realised that only orthodox economic policies would keep the ghost of inflation away. Lula appointed a conservative banker, Henrique Meirelles, head of the Central Bank, and briefed him to keep his eye on the inflation ball. As The Economist has pointed out, for a country whose average yearly inflation in the early 1990s reached 700 per cent, to have in 2006 a growth rate that was, for the first time, higher than the inflation rate was quite a feat.Lula, a former metal worker who lost one of his fingers on the factory floor, also came up with an imaginative social policy, the Bolsa de Familia. It transfers cash income to some 11 million families, who have to meet certain conditions (including school attendance of children, and monthly visits to government agencies), and has diminished Brazil's income inequality.As a man who cut his political teeth in the trade union movement, Lula knows all about “win-win” negotiations. He has also a remarkable ability to get along with everybody — from George W. Bush to Hugo Chávez. The PT is only one among many in the fragmented Brazilian party system (it controls only the governorships in three States out of Brazil's 27), and he leads a coalition government that includes right-wing parties, in Brazil's hard to manage “presidential coalitionism.” He has struck a delicate balance in which the private sector is the driving force of the economy, but the state plays a significant role through entities such as the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento (BNDES), which has a larger lending budget than the World Bank, and Petrobras, the state-owned oil company.In a country known for its populist, demagogic traditions, Lula embodies the modern leader who believes in institutions. In a region where many presidents want to perpetuate themselves in office, he rejected the possibility of changing the Constitution to allow him a third term. His own rags-to-riches trajectory and austere personal habits have meant that the corruption scandals that affected some of his staff never seriously dented his popularity, leading to the moniker of “teflon president”. His approval ratings have reached 80 per cent. He has been mentioned for a variety of top international jobs once he leaves office on 1 January 2011— from President of the World Bank to Secretary-General of the United Nations.Given that in foreign affairs also Lula has made a big impact, this is not surprising. With Celso Amorim as his Foreign Minister, he has capitalised on Brazil's “diplomatic GDP.”With an outstanding Foreign Ministry — known as “Itamaraty” for the 19th century palace in Rio de Janeiro that used to house it before the capital moved to Brazilia — Brazil has exercised its diplomacy with finesse and effectiveness. On the multilateral front, its ability to build coalitions, to give direction to the international agenda, and to take on key global governance issues has stood out. It has displayed it in the WTO and the U.N., as well as in the creation of (or inclusion in) myriad acronyms such as BRICs, BRICSAM, IBSA, the G20+, the G4, the O5, and, most notably, in the G20 at the leaders level (“the steering committee of the world economy”) launched in Washington in November 2008, and whose next meeting is being held in Toronto in late June. It has also put its money where its mouth is: at a time when many Foreign Ministries have cut budgets and closed embassies, Brazil, grasping that diplomacy has become more, and not less, significant in the age of globalisation, has done the opposite. From 2003 to 2008 it opened 32 embassies abroad, and now has 134.In Latin America also Brazil has played a key role. It has been the driving force behind new entities such as UNASUR, which has brought together all nations in South America, and the associated South American Defence Council, designed to provide an alternative to the by-now obsolete Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. It has taken the lead in stabilising Haiti through MINUSTAH, the first U.N. peacekeeping mission formed by a majority of Latin American troops and headed by a Brazilian general. It is willing to work with Washington, but not if that entails sacrificing principles such as democratic rule, as shown in last year's Honduran crisis.Instead of caving in to the so-called imperatives of globalisation, as so many other developing nations have done, Lula has led Brazil to assert its autonomy and independence, setting its own conditions for dealing with an international order in flux. His is the best example of the power of agency and initiative in foreign policy and diplomacy.

Uma Maheswari said on Wednesday.Kicking off the Intensive Student Enrollment Awareness Campaign in Karur district at the Panchayat Union Primary School at Taragampatty near here Dr. Uma Maheswari said that an enumeration undertaken by the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan last year revealed that there were 73,154 children in the age group of six and 10 in the district.Of them 37,809 were boys and the rest girls. Of them, a total of 72,469 have been undergoing studies in various schools in the district and efforts were being made to enroll the balance 685 students who have stopped going to school or have not been admitted to schools.During the last year's census on children in the 11 to 14 years age group, a total of 55,702 students including 27,216 girls were enlisted. Of them 54,671 children have joined schools in the district while the SSA authorities were taking efforts to track down the rest 1,031 boys and girls and get them enrolled in schools, Dr. Uma Maheswari said. The stress would be on finding the reasons for the dropouts in particular cases and also ensuring that the children never enrolled were admitted in the nearby schools to pursue their education. While the officials were doing their bit, the role of the parents and the elders in the family need to be stressed, the Collector said.

The achievement of Anbakam Metals was illustrated in Home News Tribune and Sentinel.The award stresses the importance of exports in the national economy and illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities, the Sentinel reported. “Anbakam's niche markets have been focussed on the Indian subcontinent region and the Far East. The firm has helped to create a demand for containerized shipments of metal scrap while supplying jobs amid a gloomy job market.It has used the Department of Commerce's Gold Key Program to create business opportunities and sales in the Vietnam market,” the report said.While working as a business software developer for JP Morgan Chase Mr. Sivakumar started the company by customising containers for easy loading of scrap metal for export from trucks to ships at the Northeast region of United States.The company moved 10,000 tonnes of scrap metal to overseas market last year using the small volumes approach that had been vogue for years in California and Florida.Exports by the company accounted for one per cent of the 14 million tonnes of ferrous exports from the US in 2009, according to the report published by Home News Tribune. A press release issued by the company's Liaison Office, Tiruchi, said that the award designed by the US Government to recognise export businesses illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities and companies which have successfully entered into international markets and had great success with the help of US Government agencies.Anbakam Metals is now looking to extend its services to newer, untouched markets, the release said.Mr. Sivakumar, who started his career as a 22-year-old with Pershing Corp, which specialised in business intelligence technology, and subsequently worked for BMW and JP Morgan, before venturing into the metal scrap business, said of Anbakam's future plans: “In next three to six months, we will be breaking ground for a power plant in South India and also venturing into renewable energy sector in the USA. By providing countries with these raw materials and our services, we become an essential part to the infrastructural growth in these markets.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/USA-honours-Tiruvarur-emigrant-with-award/article16298621.ece

We have absolute confidence in these players,” Loew said.There was, as expected, no place for midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger who has moved to Italian side Lazio after losing his place in the VfB Stuttgart side.Eight players were part of the 2006 World Cup team that had clinched third place: Ballack, Lahm, Klose, Schweinsteiger, Per Mertesacker, Arne Friedrich (Hertha Berlin), Marcell Jansen (Hamburger) and Lukas Podolski (Cologne).Loew said the preparations for the World Cup had never been more difficult or complicated because of the many leading players who will be joining training camps later in view of their club commitments.Ballack, who is appearing with Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and the Bayern and Bremen players, who are in the German Cup final a week on Saturday, will miss a friendly against Malta a day earlier.The Bayern players won’t be able to join up with the rest of the squad until after the May 22 Champions League final against Inter Milan in Madrid.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Seven-Bayern-players-in-Germany-WC-squad/article16298812.ece

I’m very pleased — it’s great for the club, a good achievement, and we have played great football this year.” Spurs were bottom of the table when Redknapp took over in October 2008 but quickly turned them around.“Of course this means a lot to me,” he said. “I’m delighted, but I know I’m good at my job. I wouldn’t have done it if I was a mug.” Tottenham were the better side throughout, and Ledley King had the ball in the net in the first half, but his goal was ruled out for a foul.Adam Johnson tested Huerelho Gomes in the Tottenham goal, and the goalkeeper stopped a deflection from his own defender, Gareth Bale, before Kolo Toure headed straight at Gomes.Jermain Defoe forced a good save from Martin Fulop, and for a long time it looked as if it would be a draw.But with eight minutes to go, Younes Kaboul sent in a cross that took a deflection, and Fulop palmed the ball straight at Crouch, who headed the ball over the line.“I’m just very happy to finish fourth. That’s where we wanted to be,” Redknapp said. “It was important someone got in from outside the big four, I could only see Man City breaking in.“I thought it was going to be really tough — I could only see us finishing in the top seven and getting a European place.

  A young veena performer from the Lalgudi family, immersed in a concert by veena S. Balachander and her aunt-guru Padmavathi Ananthagopalan, was called on stage by the maestro himself to take part. She impressed enough for him to announce that the young talent would henceforth flourish in his school. If that was a day Jayanthi Kumaresh cherishes, it is no wonder that her performances today, resonant with Balachander's style, are stamped with remarkable intellectual value.Even the recent Kumaresh-Jayanthi ‘violin-veena melodic-samvaada' at the Chamarajpet Ramseva Mandali was steeped in classicism with nary a hint of dumbing down.Although Lalgudi Rajalakshmi's gifted daughter continued her tutelage under Balachander till his death in 1990, she makes it a point to underscore the strong foundation and strict schooling she received from her aunt Padmavathi.“It wasn't just the classes, the disciplinarian that she was had me work in clockwork precision through the day. After school, her timetable had me take up yoga, typing, French classes, dance, music lessons and creative pursuits of writing and poetry.”Jayanthi, who has a Masters in English Literature, says “every pursuit will come in handy for decades”.Consider the sumptuousness of her approach, which, from the gayaki styling went on to grasp the highly individualistic creativity of Balachander's genius.“Every raga has to be discovered beyond its clichéd phrases,” she says. “Balachander was fond of raga expositions more than format-kritis, as lyrics and language, he believed, were beyond the realms of an instrument.”Jayanthi too is self-made, as her approach over the years of melodic discovery is fashioned in a way that “people understand the divine characteristics of the instrument too”. Novelty in her exercises are also to be commended, for, nothing strays beyond the classical contours. It is here that her husband Kumaresh explains her CD Thillana-Thillana that has some bracing exclusivity.Jayanthi enjoys her role in Shastriya Syndicate Presentations (a Hindustani and Carnatic collaboration) just as she sounds animated to spearhead her fusion band, Indian Spice, that has piquant raga-based presentations with vocals, drums, Latin percussion, keyboard, tabla, violin and, of course, the veena.",https://www.thehindu.com/arts/Shes-got-the-whole-world-on-a-string/article16299553.ece

Abhishek Bachchan must be a happy man — not everyone gets to work for Mani Ratnam thrice! His third film with the celebrated director, Raavan is slated to hit the marquees soon. The actor narrates the unforgettable experience the film was, and why his role is the most fun he's played yet. Excerpts.


We see you jumping off a cliff, in the Raavan promo. Did it yourself?

Yeah. It was in Hogenakkal, and it was 90-foot high. Mani said: ‘I can't let my lead actor jump; the river current is strong, and there's rock below the water'. The insurance guys agreed (laughs). But, I insisted I'd do it myself, for we had a diver along, to teach me. A five-year-old boy jumped next to us, those were kids who do it for money. So, I told Mani: ‘If he can do it, so can I.'

What was going on in your mind when you jumped?

The jump takes so long that you actually have the time to think ‘Oh God, I am going to die'… but, it was fun. I did it just once. In fact, I've not done a more physically and emotionally challenging film in my career. Shooting drains you, but you feel nice when you return home; you feel you've achieved something.

Could you connect to the mythological Raavan while playing this character?

Look, the film is not like any other film. However, it has glimpses of mythology, just like any other film. When I told Mani people will draw comparisons, he asked me to name one film that wasn't influenced by mythology. And, I couldn't! But, Raavan is a modern film. It is not inspired by any other character or contemporary leader. He is just a character Mani came up with.

But your character Beera is spoken of as having 10 heads… just like Raavan.

The ten heads refer to ten personalities — there are ten different facets that are easily referred to as dus sar. Incidentally, Beera's pet name in the film is Raavan. Beera is like an animal — he is wild and unpredictable. He's the most fun guy I've ever played. We actors make character sketches so we can follow them in deciding what a character would and wouldn't do. For example, there are certain things Gurukant Desai (Guru) could do and couldn't. But, Beera will be laughing one minute, and the next, there'll be anger on his face. The fun thing about Beera is there's nothing he won't do; he can get away with anything.

How was it to work with Mani Ratnam for the third time — after Yuva and Guru?

You are in awe of him because of what he brings to the table, but the moment he says cut, he becomes this close friend. His favourite line is ‘Keep it real, make it real'. While you are standing in five feet of freezing water, with snakes swimming around and leeches sticking to you, Mani says: ‘Do anything, but make it a convincing performance'. If you are standing under the waterfall or on a hostile terrain, you'll find Mani leading from the front, standing in waist-deep water himself. If he can do it, who are you to not?

Were you scared for Aishwarya that she too had to do stunts, as in the song ‘Behne de'?

You know what? Half-way through rough terrains, she was the one guiding me as to where to place my feet. In fact, she's the film's hero; Dev and Beera are the heroines. She was helping Kenny (actor Vikram) sir too. Kenny and I'd watch her stunts wondering: ‘kaise karti hai re? (hey, how does she do it?)'. Not just stunts, she picks up everything in a jiffy — think dance steps. So much so that after our three- or four-day dance rehearsals, our performance is judged against hers!

How is it to act with your wife?

It's great to work with one of the finest actors and one of the most dedicated professionals in the country. But, the best part is, the moment Mani announces ‘pack up', I'm with my wife!

417,A method in madness,SHELLEY WALIA,2010-05-06,19:14:59 IST,"Jonathan Littell's novel The Kindly Ones is a translation of the French version published in 2006. Ever since its publication, it has achieved a monumental status both in France and the rest of the world with its grim World War II plot. It concerns the life of Maximilien Aue who unemotionally participates in the Nazi atrocities, and has been at Auschwitz and at Berlin during the Allied attacks. As Littell aptly puts it, his hero is a ‘roving X-Ray, a scanner', more of a machine than human to whom the landscape is as important as the gas chambers.The novel is largely a reworking of the Orestia myth where after killing his mother Clytemnestra, Orestes is hounded by the Furies. At the end of the Greek play, the Furies are appeased and metamorphose into Eumenides which literally means ‘the oindly ones'. Orestes goes free and unpunished just as Aue, who, on the one hand, is an obedient slave of the genocide machinery, and on the other, becomes a reliable and an objective narrator of the Nazi crime, claiming that genocide paradoxically has behind it the impetus of “calm, collected'' ordinary people. Though addressed to his ‘human brothers' the book seeks answers to the reason why such heartless cruelty exists in the world. As Aue maintains: ‘Now of course the war is over. And we've learned our lesson, it won't happen again. But are you quite sure we've learned our lesson? Are you certain it won't happen again?' He goes on to argue: ‘There are psychopaths everywhere, all the time. Our quiet suburbs are crawling with pedophiles and maniacs, our homeless shelters are packed with raving megalomaniacs …and then the very same State that would without batting an eye send them to war crushes them like a blood-swollen mosquito. These sick men are nothing. But the ordinary men that make up the State— especially in unstable times — now there's the real danger. The real danger for mankind is me, is you.'
Contrasts
Guilty of murder and matricide, he remains happily oblivious of his role, busy as he is in the concluding years of his life employed as a Director in a lace factory. Loss of memory of his past is interestingly in contrast with his clear memory of the Nazi madness and the horror of those years of destruction. He is located inside the story of Germany and yet becomes the clear headed analyst from the vantage point of an outsider. Aue's account of Germany war history takes up much of the book. On the other hand the story of his private life as a homosexual incestuously craving for anal sex with his twin sister never reaches any conclusive end.Finally, the book leaves the reader with an open-ended world of questions to a phenomenon that has intrigued the world for decades: why did the very responsible and often learned Nazi supporters back such a terrible programme of extermination. Certainly, not because of the anti-Semitic ideology, nor a personal grouse against the Jews. Justice and responsibility are after all not all that unambiguously simple concepts to deal with. The theme of dichotomy of passion and indifference draws the reader simultaneously to understand the crime and to condemn it.In doing his work, the war criminal does not hate the people he executes, nor is he taking revenge on them or killing them because they are a threat to him. As in the case of Aue, there is no revulsion, shame or guilt. Nevertheless he compares the American soldier in Vietnam with the Nazis: “he is ‘just like you,' and people like you are capable of carrying out even the most horrific acts when the circumstances demand it. If you are an American, consider your little Vietnam adventure, which so traumatized your fellow citizens. You lost fifty thousand troops there in ten years… I obviously am not including the Vietnamese dead; since you never speak of them, in your books or TV programs.… In a total war there can be no civilians, only the fight of one mass against another. In such a fight every participant is equally guilty: the killers with blood on their hands and the supply officers who fuel the trucks. You might have died rather than shoot, but would you have died rather than pump gasoline?”The story derives its significance from the complex notions of justice, guilt and responsibility and takes us back to the controversy over Hannah Arendt's article “Eichmann in Jerusalem” (1963) on Adolf Eichmann's trial. The book becomes intellectually challenging when seen in terms of the sense of duty when the crime begins to take on another shade of the responsibility of action. Within the ambit of one's duty lies the question of behaviour according to the demands of the job in hand even if it means death for some. This is the central paradox of any discussion on the philosophical issue of ethics and duty.
Going beyond
Aue's involvement, like Eichmann's, in sending hundreds of Jews to the gas chambers does not give him any pangs of conscience, but is the result of a deep-seated desire to fulfill the demands of an assignment. Personal feelings or the sense of morality are not permitted to interfere with the sense of duty.To Arendt, it was more a case of thoughtlessness, than a ‘monstrosity', an incapacity to ‘think from the point of view of others.' And Littell elaborates on this idea through a fictional work that is at once history as an eyewitness account as well as a critique of passive acceptance of a role that the state imposes on individuals who headlong turn into cogs in the wheels of the state apparatus.On the human level the choices we make determine our destiny and define our ideological stance. Rules are too conventional and narrow in scope to cover the paradoxes and ironies of our existence.

418,A longing for ease,SOFIA GHORI SALEEM,2010-05-06,19:13:02 IST,"Another Gulmohar Tree written by Aamer Hussein, is a story two people from across the continents who build a life together of quest, commitment and ultimate reward. Lydia is an English woman who meets Usman, a Pakistani writer 10 years her senior, at a socialist seminar in Bloomsbury. She decides to follow Usman back to Pakistan and eventually marries him and settles down in Karachi. The story tells about Lydia's many, seemingly easy adjustments, and adaptations to her new life and culture. Usman, on the other hand, appears to struggle with his life, his career and his family.The book describes the couple to be “Puzzled angels, visiting earth on holiday, lost until you finally find each other.” Lydia certainly comes through as an angel who forsakes her career, her language, culture, religion and country for the sake of her love for a foreign man. She is portrayed as a woman who hits the ground running and changes her name, religion, dress and even learns Urdu, all this before meeting her man again or being certain of a marriage proposal by him.One wonders whether this is the kind of confluence of east and west, people of cross cultural experience desire – a lasting commitment from a western woman whose transformation, acceptance and level of comfort with the eastern culture is so total – its a bit unbelievable. Is this realistic to expect? Can it sustain over long periods of time?Rokeya's (as Lydia now calls herself) experiences with her new culture are not elaborated upon. Her frustrations and learning experiences are foreign to the reader. Rokeya never pines for her native home or her family – except for shedding a tear when her father sends a birthday card late.Her remarkable integration is more seamless that most expatriates returning to their homeland. The book also raises the question: what is the inherent value of someone willing to change so much and demand so little. It's interesting that this book talks about the ease of adjustment when immigrating back to Pakistan just as his previous book Insomnia dwells on some of its difficulties.
Insomnia and Other Stories is a collection of short stories set in no particular place or chronological order. The main protagonist in many of the stories is a Pakistani named Murad. Many of the stories trace the life story of Murad from a young, awkward, impressionable student to a mature writer in his middle age. Hussein writes much about writers themselves in the stories “The Book of Maryam”, the “Angelic Disposition”, “Insomnia” , and “Hibiscus Days”.Hussein returns to certain central themes over and over again in his writings – the flaming Gulmohar tree, the blood red Hibiscus bush.He writes about the right to dream and the choice to serve – about disillusionment and untimely death. He examines friendships and discontinuity and the lonely life of writing. His preoccupation with writing is evident in his recurrent return to this theme.Seclusion seems to be the lot of his writers – sometimes chosen, sometimes accidental, as well as longing and a sense of not belonging. Of living in the fabric of a society and yet pulling back. These are stories about people who share the same intellectual and emotional space and inspire each other to write. Friends that form a network, or a safety blanket if you will, to nurture, coax and egg one on towards goals. All of his writer subjects are middle aged and single or divorced or childless as stated in one of the stories.The “Book of Maryam” quotes from the Quran – the story of the birth of Jesus.In “The Angelic Disposition”, the protagonist takes comfort in the strength of her husband's unquestioning support to grieve for a man who was never more than a friend. She counts on her rosary (tasbeeh) 33 times, then 33 times, then 33 times again, not the names of her Lord, but the words of her friend. The story makes reference to the Christian belief of Satan being a fallen angel – and that angels should never grow old.“Insomnia” is about melancholy, grief and soul searching, death and devastation, where the silence stretches on waiting for the phone to ring for the next encounter with a friend.Aamer Hussein's stories live in the cutting edge of loneliness, pain and a heightened need to communicate every shiny raindrop, every pearly teardrop, every flaming bush and singing thrush.They make you think - about cultural boundaries, about the passage from youth to middle age, about being a foreigner in a different land. About Wars, earthquakes, tsunamis – naturals disasters, death and darkness. About the fallibility of relationships. About feelings and futility.And they remind you of the poem “Spring and Fall – to a Young Child” byGerard Manley Hopkins : Margaret, are you grieving Over Goldengrove unleaving?

419,In the dying light,K. SRILATA,2010-05-06,19:12:02 IST,"“ I have now set out to do the things / you loved most about me./About a gift called poetry… I have set about writing, / what you perhaps would most love me to do - / write about you,” says Gopikrishnan Kottoor. “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” (a sequence of poems that forms part of the larger collection Victoria Terminus) is a tribute to the poet's dying father.That Kottoor should have given himself the permission to write these poems about his father as the latter lay in coma following a brain hemorrhage may be hard for some to understand. But then the poet tells us in no uncertain terms that this is just what his father would have wanted him to do, that, in fact, his father is more than just his muse-of-the-moment. In “saving” the poet's poems on his shelf “as though poems were pigeons/and needed a home,” the older man has nurtured his son's work, offering “a carving of [his] bone/to hone [his] poems upon”.It is at once easy and unimaginably hard to work with subjects so intensely personal, hard to write of events that unfold even as you write. That these poems travel so well is a tribute to Kottoor's abilities as a poet. Images of Christ's crucifixion intertwine with the journey into the ICU of the poet's father: “I remember you laughing your way into the ICU /Like Christ never did upon the cobbled stones.” Oddly touching even if sometimes over the top, the poems in “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” succeed in holding you. There is a sensuous quality to Kottoor's work best exemplified perhaps by the poem “The Man in the Mist”: “Someday these tears will end ./ What began as a wild desire, a wetness under the forest leaves , /turns cold, the sun takes on the words/spoken by the lips of rain, / the fragrances of bright hidden flowers/mating in the open air.” The images are fragile, evocative. One wonders though why Kottoor (with just a few exceptions) avoids the Malayalam kinship terms for father and mother.The second section - “Mother Sonata” – is also meant to be read as a sequence of poems. The poems here are reflections on pain, death and dying and, in this case, it is the poet's mother to whom the poems pay tribute. There are some weak poems in this section. Excessively sentimental and flowery, “Fairy Child” is particularly disappointing: “You were so good to lay my fairy child-head on / When I put my arms around you / you cradled me with misted clouds ,/ as upon lost mountain blues” may pass muster if written by an amateur poet. This inconsistency is somewhat puzzling.“Painted Wagons Rolling”, which forms the third section of the anthology, contains some of Kottoor's best poems. The “millipedes curling up” that emerge in the poem “Digging” testify to the “worship” that “mud-work” is. These mostly invisible creatures of the soil do their “odd jobs” in much the same way, presumably, that a poet does his.For a poet too digs – in his case, for meaning that would otherwise lie buried. The poems in this section boast of a range that is understandably lacking in the earlier two sections, containing reflections on dead poets and what survives their death to sharply satirical portraits triggered by an old boy's reunion.The last section “Victoria Terminus”, planned as another sequence, takes us on board Mumbai's local trains. We look out of the window to see old men defecating, while inside the compartment we meet card players intent on their game despite the fact of there being “not enough floor/to even straighten toes.” We also encounter deaths and bomb blasts - all the stories, big and small, that make up the Mumbai local. While one appreciates the spirit behind these Mumbai local vignettes, one can't help wishing that Kottoor had been more careful in his crafting and diction. Poems like “The Eunuchs” and “Drinking Water” remain on the surface, lacking the subtlety, the layers that emerge in “Digging” and “The Man in the Mist”.

420,‘I’ve always been a writer’,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,19:11:03 IST,"RAHULMEHTA: Coming out.
  | Photo Credit: g mail Rahul Mehta’s short-story collection Quarantine is about young gay men and their relationships with their families and lovers. Written with unusual tenderness and insight, the book represents a coming out of sorts for Mehta, a U.S.-based lecturer whose relatives in India don’t yet know that he is homosexual.
When did you first develop an interest in writing, and specifically creative writing?
I’ve always been a writer. Even when I was 13 or 14, I was telling people that I was going to be a writer. In ninth grade once, we had to do a research project on a career that we were interested in. When we had to submit our proposals for our projects, I chose “writer”, and my teacher wrote back, “That’s not a career. Choose something else.” So I shadowed an advertising executive.To be fair to my teacher, I don’t think she was necessarily trying to discourage me. I think she was just trying to get me to be practical, to save me from a difficult path. Much later, in grad school, one of my professors said a similar thing. She said she always tells her students who want to become writers, “If you can do something else, do it. If you can’t: God help you, and welcome.”
At risk of sounding reductive, was there a connection between your initial realisation that you were gay and your taking up writing? Did writing help you come to terms with your sexuality?
I do think that there is a connection. Being gay forced me early on to question one of the most fundamental aspects of who I am. Naturally, that sense of inquiry extended to other areas as well. I think it led me to ask bigger questions about everything around me. I once had this boss who, ticking items off on her fingers, said, “Gay, Indian, raised in West Virginia…of course you ended up a writer.” I think what she meant was that it was only natural for me to turn to writing as a way to try to make sense of these various experiences and these various selves.
Were these stories written to announce your sexual identity in a public space? Or was the sexual orientation of the characters incidental to the whole?
My intent, always, first and foremost, is to tell a compelling story. Sure, I’m drawn to certain types of narratives and characters, but I never set out writing a story with a specific purpose other than to craft a compelling narrative. In fact, I rarely even know what a story is going to be about when I sit down to write it. The seed for a story is usually a first line that I find interesting in some way; that has some tension, perhaps in the sounds of the words or in the relationship between characters. Then I let whatever tension is inherent in that sentence lead me to what should come next. At least with first drafts, I’m very much a sentence-to-sentence writer.A writer I admire named Gary Lutz once described a similar process. He said when writing a sentence he generally puts down a word and then he tries to figure out what word that first word yearns for. That’s the word he used: “yearns.” I love that.
This is a work about marginalised people in general, not just gay people: your depictions of lonely, elderly people are very empathetic. Are you particularly interested in themes like isolation and personal dislocation?
Yes, absolutely. I do think those are themes and characters I’m particularly drawn to. Perhaps it comes from my growing up feeling so much like an outsider — brown-skinned in a small West Virginian town that was overwhelmingly white — and witnessing so many of my relatives and Indian family friends who seemed, in some way or another, to be outside as well. I grew up with my father’s parents living in our house. I often wondered what it might have felt like to them to land in this tiny southern American town after five decades of living in Mumbai.
There is a bit of sex in the book, but nothing that’s very explicit. Was that a conscious decision?
Several people have made this comment to me, that there isn’t much sex in the book and that what’s there is tasteful. I’m glad to hear it. What it says to me is that the sex doesn’t jump out or distract or hijack the narratives which, as we’ve discussed, aren’t really about sexuality at all. I think my mom would disagree with you, though. Just yesterday she was complaining to me, “Why so much sex?” But maybe, being my mother, she reads it differently than the typical reader. At any rate, I didn’t make a conscious decision one way or another about how much sex to include in the book. But I do think it’s really tough to write about sex.
The tone of the stories “The Cure” and “What We Mean” is more wry and playful than the others, though they are both very poignant in their own ways. Were you trying to be more experimental when you wrote them?
Yes, I do think both those stories have a somewhat different feel – they are much more language-driven than plot-driven. They are of a piece with a slew of shorter works (two to four pages long) that my editor and I eventually decided to cut from the collection because they seemed too different in tone and style than the other stories. Writing these pieces, I was very much influenced by writers like Lutz, whom I mentioned earlier, as well as Lydia Davis, Christine Schutt, Diane Williams and Amy Hempel — writers whose sentences have a sculptural quality and a close attention to sound.
What is your overall impression of attitudes towards homosexuality in India? The Supreme Court judgement legalising homosexuality last year was a welcome step, but it also caused paranoia in conservative circles. Then there was the recent case of a professor who committed suicide after being secretly videotaped having sex with another man.
I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Dr. Siras, and I was shocked by the vicious harassment he endured from the students. Does this event, and the paranoia and uproar you referred to, reflect widespread attitudes toward LGBT people in India? I’m not sure. But what I do know is that I’ve travelled all over India with my partner, Robert, and we’ve rarely felt comfortable being truly open about our relationship. At the same time, Robert and I feel the same discomfort in non-urban areas of the U.S. as well. If we are travelling in America, we will never check into a motel in a small town and ask for a single, king-sized bed. We always take the room with two double beds without making a fuss about it.
Have many of your relatives in India read the book?
I’ve been a total coward when it comes to talking to my relatives in India about the book or about my sexual orientation. I still haven’t told them about either. If they’ve seen the book or seen any of the press, they haven’t mentioned it to me. Honestly, I don’t know how they will react. I guess I’ll find out when I come to India next month. But I have faith in them. I know that they love me, and in the end I do think that that trumps everything. Whatever political and social hang-ups people may have, if they love you, they find a way to understand. I’ve seen this again and again with people in my life. And of course, this extends far beyond sexual orientation. Family members who truly love one another accept each other for who they are, whatever that might be.
Do you read much Indian writing in English? Is there anyone whose work you’re especially impressed by?
Arundhati Roy is basically a minor deity in my eyes. The God of Small Things is one of my all-time favourite novels, and her non-fiction writings and her social and political activism are tremendous inspirations to me. Her work is swelling with generosity and kindness. There are so many works by Indian writers from which I’ve taken inspiration — Vikram Seth’s Golden Gate, Amitav Ghosh’s Shadow Lines, and Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children come to mind. More recently I’ve loved Pankaj Mishra’s The Romantics, Githa Hariharan’s In Times of Siege, and the Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist (which I teach in one of my classes). As for poetry, I love Arun Kolatkar’s Jejuri as well as anything by Agha Shahid Ali.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/lsquoIrsquove-always-been-a-writerrsquo/article16298815.ece
421,Still going strong,BAGESHREE S.,2010-05-06,19:08:20 IST,"The Select Bookshop, Bangalore. Photo: G. RAGHAV
  The bookstore boom in Bangalore has meant the arrival of big corporate chains which offer a lot beside books. But these have in no way dimmed the charm of the much-loved antiquarian book store of Bangalore, The Select Bookshop started way back in 1945. If anything, the old world store off Brigade Road seems more precious than ever before, no less than a landmark of the city.
A wide variety
The store is crammed with unusual and rare second-hand books on a variety of topics ranging from Oriental literature to architecture and gardening. What makes the store extra special is its amiable owner, K.K.S. Murthy, who knows every book, and more often than not, will tell you an interesting story or two on how he came to acquire it.The shop was started by Murthy's bibliophile father K.B.K. Rao, who turned his love for collecting books into a business enterprise. He often travelled from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh to Bangalore to pick out rare books at auctions and eventually started Select here. Mr. Murthy, who was working as an aeronautical engineer in the United States, followed his father's footsteps into the book trade in the 1970s.Even as he worked in New Jersey, Mr. Murthy's weekends were dedicated to scouting for precious books for his father back home. He can vividly recall chancing upon some “extraordinary rejects” in the backyard of Barnes and Noble, such as a rare collection of Carl Jung's writings.Over the years Select has retains its dedicated clientele and new people keep walking in, having heard of this quaint place by word of mouth. The shop has had its share of illustrious customers, including C.V. Raman, Philip Spratt, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar and Ruskin Bond.Select now also has its own imprint, which has brought out some valuable books such as a reprint of Ananda Coomaraswamy's Time and Eternity. The first floor of the shop is an art gallery.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Still-going-strong/article16298814.ece
422,Some rare gems,SHALINI SHAH,2010-05-06,19:07:16 IST,"Space for all: At the Oxford Bookstore, Delhi.
  While dedicated antique bookshops are rare, digging around old bookstores, one can come across some gems. Paramount Book Store on Janpath, New Delhi, is one such store. Ask owner Naresh Kambiri about antique books and he produces a fragile International Library of Famous Literature carefully wrapped in a dusty plastic bag. One of 20, the book had been edited by Dr. Richard Garnett of the British Museum and was published in 1900. Rare books by Kashmiri Sufi saint Lalla Rukh are available too. But there isn't much of a demand. “We've only been getting enquiries, that too mostly from foreigners,” says Kambiri.The Oxford Bookstore has a section on antique and rare books. These include first editions, limited editions, rare publications and out-of-print books. It is interesting to see tomes like Voyages and Travels: India, Ceylon, The Red Sea, Abyssinia and Egypt (first printed in 1811), A New Account of the East Indies: 1688 to 1723 (first printed in 1739), India and its Native Princes: Travels in Central India and in the Presidencies of Bombay and Bengal by Louis Rousselet (1875) and A History of the Indian Mutiny by G.W.

423,A bunch of blooms,SHREEKUMAR VARMA,2010-05-06,19:05:40 IST,"It is one thing to gather a bouquet, and quite another to conjure up a bunch of surprisingly different blooms, that satisfies because of its variety and freshness. Penguin's First Proof 5is a gathering of personal voices that explore moods and relationships, challenges and statistics through fiction, nonfiction and a pinch of verse.
Stunning start
It begins with the stunning story of Ruma, prostitute by day, housewife by night, an activist who yet surrenders to the pressures of husband and family. Bishakha Datta's straightforward prose brings alive the paradox in the life of a woman whose sacrifices may never be recognised by society as we have it today. Samanth Subramaniam's “Hunting the Sailfish” culls tense drama through minimalist narrative, reportage that simmers beneath the surface. Hemingway's ghost looms over us because of the subject, philosophy and sparseness of expression.What follows in the nonfiction section is a quick-fire portrait of jungle-king Veerappan, his interactions with people he's kidnapped. And an interesting sketch of Kutch with its paling borders of landscape, language and people, followed by a very objective study by three women of women who want to have “fun”, the problems they face while occupying space without “purpose”. Editor-in-chief of The New Indian ExpressAditya Sinha's brutally frank forays into family history and latent homosexuality can only result in his being forever persona non grata with a clutch of rankled relatives. Vamsee Juluri's study of non-violence and “Munnabhai” examines the proffered meaning of Gandhi's heritage and its scope, concluding that cinema is still its one faithful follower. Satnam's sojourn in the Bastar jungle is next, along with communist guerrillas, an account of the routine life of militants, with mild, off-the-cuff observations: “A fortress-like structure had been erected with tree branches and bamboo, where the guerrillas practise destroying such fortifications”.And so to fiction.The first offering is K.R. Meera's “Ave Maria”, a brutal glimpse into the debris of Kerala's Communist ideology, the fault lines left behind in families. “The Imaginary Friend” tells of a man and his little cousin, a train journey that shows how the mind can make or break. “The Brass Tumbler” follows the tradition of classic Hindi fiction, the story of an heirloom whose history mirrors (or causes) a family's upheavals.
Exquisite stories
The two stories that follow are gems. Completely different in tone and setting, they scream out the need for love and freedom, of belonging and recognition, women's outpourings that yearn for choices within the patriarchal claustrophobia. Bakul Mukhtiar's tale of an extra-marital relationship is sparse and evocative, like the room where the liaisons take place. And Swarnalatha Rangarajan's “Hiranmayi” is a tale lushly told, of an era gone by, child marriages and dark rooms, stark lives lit by hope, wives abandoned by terribly traditional in-laws.Relief comes with Cheryl-Ann Couto's “Slim Pickings”, hilarious and acutely observed, a warmth that dissipates unbelievably in the echoes of an old tragedy. “The Last Supper In Delhi” is elegantly told, of high living in the Capital, of art and partying, surprise end to a year-end celebration. “The Dining Table” is the story of memory and family, and “Bankru't” takes place in Indonesia with discussions about West Bengal's politics and economics, finally reaching an unexpected twist which can only bring resolution.Radha Nair's “A Grand Repast” takes an admiring look at an uncle in a Kerala household, a connoisseur whose fanatic enjoyment of cooked fish is a celebration of life.
Poetic takes
Manash Bhattacharya's three poems use sudden words and conceits, juggling up images and whimsical insight to commemorate love. (“But I remember how you had first/ stirred inside my head like a child/ in a sick mother's womb.”) And Radha Sinha's two poems conclude the book, straightforward and resonant: “Love songs remind me of you and I when we weren't us./ We were mad, free. We were our children./ Now all they do is remind me of what we'll never be.”First Proof 5is a book worth returning to, though one wishes someone had given it a second proof-reading.

424,Flavours of the north-east,RANJITA BISWAS,2010-05-06,19:04:33 IST,"The debate over whether a translated work destroys the flavour of the original is long over, one assumes. Thankfully! Without translation, voices from around the world, excluding English or any major language, would have been confined into cocoons. In India itself, regional literature is of great dimension. But for the translations, lovers of literature would have been in a limbo to taste local flavours.For instance, the Assamese language, mainly spoken in the Brahmaputra Valley has a rich literary tradition. Contemporary Assamese short stories are some of the best in the country today, acknowledge litterateurs basing their view on the limited number of translations available in English.
Varied themes
Well-known journalist and translator Dhirendra Nath Bezboruah's A Game of Chess, a compilation of fifteen stories, gives a glimpse of the richness and variety of themes in modern Assamese short stories. Starting with “The Decision” by Syed Abdul Malik, a path-breaking writer from the 1950s, which etches a delightful cameo of a woman (Aimoni) with a mind of her own, and wrapped up with “Parable of an Ancient Triangle” by young writer Moushumi Kandali on the dilemma of a feminist and her student, the anthology covers a wide range of human situations.Within this range figure some of the most famous short stories in contemporary Assamese language. Bhabendra Nath Saikia, who ushered in a new era in Assamese literature in the 1960s with his insightful observation of the human character and situation, features in three stories. ‘The Cavern” is a sardonic look at such a situation as a White supremacy believer's heart gets transplanted by a Black man's heart and its effect on him, in an oblique reference to South Africa which was still practising Apartheid and where also the world's first heart transplant took place.“A Game of Chess” by Saurabh Kumar Chaliha, known for his eclectic choice of themes, plays another kind of psychological game with two friends, one successful, the other loser, over a chess-board. His “Bonsai” – on modern society's penchant for consumerism and clever marketing ploys by manufacturers with affordable mini versions of products - ‘sachets' of shampoo or coffee available even in rural backwaters, leaves one wondering – would people enjoy mini-literature, mini-bananas, etc?Jnanpith Award winner Indira Goswami's “The Journey”, Atulananda Goswami's “Munni's Legs” and Harekrishna Deka's “The Prisoner” are reflections on the unstable state of affairs in the region due to the long-drawn insurgency and conflict and their effect on ordinary people.Manoj Goswami's sheering “Samiran Borua is on His Way” resonates with the sighs of idealists anywhere, left behind by a society moving on while they themselves lose their youth and home hoping to change an unjust society.
Global feel
The locale of Arupa Patagia Kalita's “A Nymph of the Desert” moves from the lush green valley of Assam to the arid desert of Rajasthan but the theme of urban-rural divide, of anorexic socialites and starving desert women, can be placed anywhere – even today, and perhaps more so in this global-economic village.Apurba Sharma's “Monica and Vikram” drawing on one of the India's famous myth story characters — Betaal and Vikramaditya, to transplant into a modern version is an interesting experiment but the story is too long and at times gets tedious with social comments verging on lectures on social ills.By the translator-editor's own admission, the anthology does not make “claims of ..being a representative collection of any era or period of time” but chosen because he felt ‘impelled' to translate them. “It is possible to have forty or fifty anthologies of good Assamese short stories in translation,” he writes in the preface. Yet the book gives a worthy glimpse into the wealth of this literature from the North East.The meticulous translation with an eye to maintaining the local flavour, a glossary of local words and their meanings, and profiles of the original authors add to the value to the book.

425,Rich encounters,VIJAY NAMBISAN,2010-05-06,19:03:29 IST,"It so happened that I read this book at a time when I was having to speak five languages on a daily basis. None of them was new; but reading this made me aware of what I was doing. I could almost sense the different brain paths in use, and I was certainly sensible of a different cultural approach to each. It was the best way – and one I could never have planned – to appreciate Rich's experience of learning Hindi from scratch.
Writerly forays
Rich's background is with magazines, not academics. Why she chose to learn Hindi is never clearly spelled out. She'd lost her job, and was recovering from cancer. (She wrote an award-winning book about her battle with “The Red Devil”.) She lied to an editor who'd asked her for some freelance work, saying “I'll be in India,” and was told, “Do something for us there.”From Delhi, she was sent to an academy in Udaipur which taught foreign students. She arrived at a difficult time: five days before the attacks on New York, and that was followed in short order by the attack on Parliament, then came Godhra and the subsequent carnage. Her magazine background serves her well. She details with painstaking and sometimes painful honesty her reactions to the hatred spewed by fanatics everywhere, the branding of humans by community. There was then a palpable, shimmering unease in the air which she describes elegantly.Personal relationships are her metier. Her depictions of social dynamics at the language academy, with her various local hosts, among the expats, at a school for deaf children – all these leaven the narrative and make absorbing reading. She also has a gift for concisely expressing complex ideas. What adds great value is her attempts, before and after her Indian sojourn, to pin down the physiology of language skills. She has spoken to and read many experts, with almost as many theories. She offers these lucidly and convincingly where relevant to her story.
An instance, at random:
Recently, a cognitive neurolinguist at the University of Washington made an extraordinary discovery about the extent to which our brains understand more than we can say. [He] scanned neophyte French students… using a device that measures electrical activity in the brain. At two weeks in, after test participants had received only eight hours of instruction, [he] attached electrodes to their scalps and showed them lists of words. Some were French, some made up. When they were asked to say which were which, they did as expected: scored, on average, 50 per cent. They guessed…. But the scans showed their brains were getting the answers right.There are too many such remarkable findings to quote in a review.Rich falls into many of the traps India sets for Westerners. There is the inapposite caste-naming, for example: “the pretty Brahmin teacher”. When she wants to talk to “a dalit”, any dalit, she is warned off by an instructor. Is it so difficult, finding “a dalit”? There are outdated notions of Indian women living a secret life. (This is perhaps not so outdated in Rajasthan. But then she shouldn't talk of “Indian women”.)To be fair, she makes her own bloomers too. She confuses the Indian Congress with the American idea; says south Indian languages are as far from Hindi as English is from Mandarin; describes the charkha as having adorned the Indian flag for many years…. And ye gods, her spellings: “atmaan, Brahmaan”, “mendhi”, “Vidyala” – I wonder why, if Westland must reprint an American book for us, they can't correct these things.Though Rich achieved, in some measure, her dream of dreaming in Hindi, her language skills cannot be very considerable. Her Hindi is of that Sanskritic order which is taught in schools, and rings quaintly to the man in the street. Rajasthan is not the best place to learn the lingua Indica. Her English, too, like that of so many American writers (and Indian journalists), is often found to settle for the approximate rather than the exact. On the same page I find “a trifling” used for “a trifle” and “precedence” for “precedent”.But working polyglots, unlike academics and UN interpreters, need to communicate, not dazzle. It is Rich's journey that is fascinating. She did not undertake it for any material reward (though this book must be selling), but for the excitement of what she discovered along the way. That is its own reward, both for her and the reader. A professional academic would have written a more factually accurate account. She would have used more method. She would also, nine times out of ten, have been boring. It is precisely Rich's peripatetic approach that gives this book its charm. So long as it is not used as a guide – but that is, unfortunately, just how the unwary and lazy will use it. Bhai, zaraa dekhke chalo.
Vijay Nambisan's translations of two 16th century Kerala poems were published last year.

426,Celebrating the academic poet,M.S. NAGARAJAN,2010-05-06,19:01:30 IST,"Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a short anthology of seventy-five “lyrical poems with soft, sensuous and passionate lines” composed on different occasions spanning a period of nearly three decades. She has had the advantage of getting to know, rather intimately, her contemporaries, poets who helped shape her poems, offering suggestions and putting her on the right track.Nissim Ezekiel who was a pathfinder for many of the younger generation brought her into contact with Gieve Patel, Kamala Das, Dom Moraes and others. Arun Kolatkar and Adil Jussawalla too had their bit of role in promoting her poems. More than all, the academic circle she grew up in afforded a lot of exposure to good and great poetry. In this sense, it is right to place her among the group of Indian academic poets of the post-independence era.Her early ‘Catholic' poems from her collection Fix are autobiographical—if not confessional—in nature, helping us gain a peep into the nature of her later poetry.The beliefs and disbeliefs of the Goan-Catholic community of Mumbaikars provide her with enough material for a conducted tour, as it were, of the inner lives of this group of people. “Catholic Mother” provides four biting — if not scornful — snapshots of her family. The father believes that God always provides for that big family of seven young children. According to the parish priest, he is the pillar of the church, and for Mother Superior, it is a lovely Catholic family. The last line that her mother ‘says nothing' is ambivalent. Profoundly intimate, yet aesthetically distant, is the poem an acceptance or a denial of father's role and presence? The poet stands outside in a distanced position from which she can apprehend the fallacies of both positions.Institutionalised religious morality and subjective personal judgments can both fall outside the domain of true experience of human life.Eunice De Souza's poems are narrative in style, simple and direct oftentimes but the ideas they explore are not as simple as all that. The poem “Mid Sentence” from her collection of “Recent Poems” is illustrative of this mode. There is no wailing, no sentimental cries. There is just the banal closing line; ‘It was thoughtless to vanish so suddenly,' referring to the sudden passing away of someone (Finis. Kaput. Dead.) whose identity is not revealed. There is a commingling of a joyous life full of hope and expectation with the sudden close with ‘neither harp nor halo.'The lyric expands the metaphor of the opening line, “You left mid-sentence…” Death looms large in the anthology the title of which (“A Necklace of Skulls”) seems deliberate.The influence of William Blake on Eunice De Souza is unmistakable: the two of the longest poems, “Songs of Survival” and “Songs of Innocence” bear an echo of Blake. But unlike Blake who portrays complementary and opposing views on the transcendent mystery of creation as in “The Lamb” and “The Tyger,” these two companion pieces present related views enquiring into the phenomena of innocence and survival.Standing outside the two perceptions, the poet explores the limitations of being ‘happy with him forever/in this world and the next,' (innocence), while denouncing the self-deprecating attitudes, extols the philosophy of stoicism and the Schopenhauerean virtues of the will to live. The poems of De Souza are well-wrought lyrics, inflexible and firm, short in design. In fact the very economy of utterances helps her in arriving at such a delicately finished form.Full of understatements, avoiding any external aid in the form of conceits, metaphors or symbols, Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a welcome addition to the Indo-Anglian shelf.

427,Too many loose ends,SAAZ AGGARWAL,2010-05-06,18:59:44 IST,"The House on Mall Road
  Parvati is 27-years-old and this is the story of a journey she makes to try and find out what exactly happened 20 years ago when tragedy irretrievably changed her circumstances.Travelling with her, we learn something about life in an army cantonment near the border and the dangers that we, sitting comfortably curled up and reading novels, are safe from. The discipline, the atmosphere of wide spaces, smartly-uniformed personnel of every rank, the abundance of various resources, the monotonous routine, the deceptively jolly and rotund officers (eagle-eyed and razor-sharp is what they really are) and the wonderfully warm but empty-headed and appearance-obsessed women (yes, some of them can be vicious and career-ruining spiteful too) are plainly described. We also discern shades of the emotional spectrum of army life – not just pride in country and fearlessness in the face of peril but also the unique conflicts within the ranks and between other groups such as police and civilians, and the classless society formed by people from so many different backgrounds.Romance enters Parvati’s story in a straightforward way but you will wait in vain for what would once have been a logical conclusion. And while you may consider this the mark of a modern story, in many ways, and particularly in its use of language, this book is anachronistic.What is it about the IIM-A novelists? Is it that difficult to put a good story together using a healthy, global – or even consistently local – idiom? With Chetan Bhagat, the story roars along without even pretending to strive for a style that could be admired. This book, on the other hand, has nothing that either Wren or Martin could object to. However, it is strewn with dated expressions like “attaché” case and “reel” for photo film roll; malapropisms as in “I am mortified of snakes”; ill-chosen adjectives as in “no offence to your fabulous profession” and the word “nice” (which shrewd writers will display before a reviewer only, and only, as a remedy for constipation) FOUR TIMES on one page – oh my god! Occasional lapses into new age concepts (“personal boundaries”; “but in a nice way”) evoke the precocious child trying out a new word, proud and a little self-conscious.If your benchmark of a good book is that, from one end to the other, you feel the characters as real people and can experience them change or grow, you will have one more reason to feel disappointed. The people here are static and at most capable of performing random unexpected acts. The narrator herself fails to claim your being, as a skilled narrator would – she’s somewhat shadowy, a tinselly voice and at best a collection of opinions.I did enjoy the series of implausible coincidences (but then truth is always stranger than fiction) and the surge of emotion towards the end of the book. However, too many loose ends were left hanging: strange happenings that are never explained and even the ghost of someone who hadn’t died after all. This book lacks the grace of a natural story. If I wasn’t reading it as a reviewer, I would never have carried on to the end.Reading Pico Iyer’s enthusiastic endorsement on the cover, I had grabbed it with excitement, anticipating the matchless pleasure of reading a wonderful first book by a talented new writer of fiction. As I read, however, excitement turned to disbelief, and then to annoyance.I’ve always been a fan of Pico Iyer’s elegant writing style. His words flow smooth and pleasing, unassuming, and often stunningly effective. I’m afraid that his description of this mediocre, clumsily-written story as “a rich and wonderfully-accomplished debut” made me wonder what sort of pressure exactly he had been under when he made it.

428,No mystery here,PARVATHI NAYAR,2010-05-06,18:58:02 IST,"The Swan Thieves by Elizabeth Kostova
  Elizabeth Kostova’s retelling of the Dracula myth, The Historian (2005), was a runaway success, a doubly creditable feat considering it was her debut novel. Logical then that she has returned to the same idea of the historical thriller with a literary bent in her latest, The Swan Thieves. Here, she turns her talents to another myth that has captured public imagination since ancient times – that of the tortured genius artist.Cleverly, Kostova sets her mystery within the time period of an enduringly popular art “ism” – i.e., Impressionism. It’s not just the continuing beauty and craftsmanship of the works that make the Impressionists so fascinating, but also that the artists were rebels of their time, who dared to see and paint things differently, thereby challenging the popular idiom.
The Swan Thieves follows two story lines that unfold through multiple voices, letters and journals. In the past lies the tale of Beatrice de Clerval, an unsung Impressionist genius of 19th-century Paris. But de Clerval’s influence extends in a mysterious manner all the way to the present - and indirectly changes forever, the lives of many people including that of the book’s chief narrator, painter/psychiatrist Dr. Andrew Marlow.Dr. Marlow’s skill lies is inducing people to open up; we are told he has the ability to get “a stone to talk”. As a result, a strange new patient is admitted into his care, the talented artist Robert Oliver. Oliver is described as a traditionalist - “I actually don’t care about concepts very much,” he growls, preferring instead to draw traditional landscapes, portraits and still lives - but with such facility that even the unforgiving avant-garde art world of the present day cannot help but recognise his talent.Oliver gets into psychiatric treatment after apparently attacking a painting depicting Leda and the swan at the National Gallery with a knife. But after an initial conversation, Oliver doesn’t break his stony silence with Dr. Marlow – which apart from anything else, calls into serious question the doctor’s ability to engage rocks and boulders in meaningful conversation.At the psychiatric facility of Goldengrove in Rockville, Oliver mostly seems to engage in activity of the “pacing the room… clenching and unclenching his jaw” genre. He also draws and paints a mysterious woman over and over – and over – again. Though painted directly from his imagination with no model, these drawings were “alive, beyond alive” we are told in hushed prose. But since Oliver refuses to talk, his motives are a mystery to all concerned. Frankly, however, as we plough through over 500 pages of narrative of how Oliver has put several people through a lot of misery thanks to his self-absorbed ways as some sort of possessed genius, we stop caring too much about the tortured artist’s misery.Dr. Marlow himself is not the most appetising of protagonists and his eye for a pretty face is, well, a bit weird. Admittedly he is pursuing Oliver’s former loves – real and imaginary – in the name of detecting, uncovering the mystery and curing his patient. However he seems far more smitten by Oliver’s women than trying to help his patient. Kostova, actually, has a thing going with age in her book, what with nubile young women constantly falling for generationally older men throughout her narrative. Some of the women also give up on their art for reasons related to the men in their lives.Almost every major character in the book draws and paints – but each of their painterly visions come off sounding disconcertingly alike. It’s hard to tell the voices apart and as a result the characterisations aren’t distinct. At one level this makes the book a bit of a uniform and plodding read – at another, this homogenisation deeply undercuts the book’s belief in the artist as an individual who sees the world differently and expresses this vision in deeply distinctive ways.Kostova tries hard to evoke the mystery of creating art as she plots out the mystery in her novel, but the descriptions sound laboured. It is a subject many authors have attempted, but the truth of the matter is that writing about painting really isn’t an easy task – it is the same ambitious leap as trying to paint what’s written between the covers of a book.

429,My name is Khan,ANVAR ALIKHAN,2010-05-06,18:55:39 IST,"Home Boy by H.M. Naqvi
  Someone e-mailed me this joke recently: In New York’s Central Park, a huge Rottweiler breaks loose from its leash and savages a small blonde child. A skinny young man rushes up and, at great risk to himself, saves the child by wrestling the dog to the ground and finally, in desperation, killing it.When it’s all over, the child’s mother comes up to the little bloodied man and thanks him profusely. It turns out she’s a famous journalist and she tells him she’s going to run a front page story about him in the New York Times headlined, “American hero saves child from vicious monster”. “But madam, I’m not American,” the little man replies. “Oh, what are you then?” asks the journalist. “I’m a Pakistani, madam”.So the next day’s New York Times carries a screaming headline, “Terrorist strangles pet dog”.No, it is not a great time to be a Pakistani. Your country is collapsing around you; your political system is one of the most rotten in the world; your society is fractured down the centre; the religious loonies are baying at the gates of your home. For many years Pakistanis who had the talent or the means usually chose to escape overseas, but in today’s world the ‘T’ word hangs threateningly over their heads wherever they go. And that is what Husain Naqvi’s Home Boy is all about.Boulevardiers and raconteursIt’s the story of three Pakistani 20-somethings living in Manhattan: Shehzad (“Chuck”), an investment banker; Jimbo, a hip-hop deejay; and AC, a dilettante and intellectual bum. They are “boulevardiers, raconteurs, renaissance men.” They hang around their favourite Tribeca bar-lounge, drinking vodka-on-the-rocks with a gaggle of socialites, arrivistes, metro-sexuals and wannabe models. They work; they play; they listen to Afro-jazz; they get in and out of trouble; they make pilgrimages to Jackson Heights to eat kabab-roti. But the theme that always seems to be playing in the background is the situation back home and “Hey-I-believe-Musharraf-is-making-an-important–speech-on-TV-today-don’t-miss-it.”After 9/11, however, the world is not the same for someone with a brown skin and a Muslim name. The three boulevardiers do something silly and the next thing they know is they’re blindfolded and squatting on the floor of a detention centre. Their homes are raided; a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook on the bookshelf is construed to be a bomb-making manual; Ibn Khaldun’s great philosophical classic Muqadimah is made out to be some kind of Islamic terror guide. And suddenly there’s an enormous FBI interrogator looming over them, saying “No phone call, no lawyer, no nothing. And if you’re lucky someday we’ll put you on a plane with a one-way ticket to Bumfuckistan. So let’s start again….” In today’s world, it’s something that could easily happen to you, or to me.
Stylish and eclectic
Naqvi writes with a stylishness and eclecticism that is so self-assured it’s almost arrogant: the fact that the book opens upon three selected quotes - the first from F. Scott Fitzgerald, the second from Urdu poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and the third from hip-hop artists, Eric B. & Rakim - is just an indication of the shape of things to come. But then Naqvi is a man who grew up in Algiers, graduated from Georgetown University, worked as an investment banker, has been a slam poet, and taught creative writing at Boston University. In fact he claims that Home Boy actually began as a slam poem, scribbled on a cocktail napkin in 1993, after his brother was routinely picked up by the cops for interrogation. And it’s that slam poet’s instinct that buzzes below the book’s sharp, sleek prose and its tightly wrought structure.
Home Boy was selected as one of the top 10 novels of the year by the Huffington Post, alongside Orhan Pamuk’s The Museum of Innocence and Ha Jin’s A Great Fall. So if I say it is one of the richest, most stylish novels I’ve read in a long time, I am in good company.

430,High voltage drama,MITA GHOSE,2010-05-06,18:53:33 IST,"The Last Victory
  Exploring this novel is somewhat like opening a carefully preserved album of beautiful images and wondering if they’ll survive the harsh light of scrutiny. Any work of fiction that dares to toy with the historical past risks courting that danger. And the final days of the Raj, in particular — the subject of The Last Victory — has inspired so many memorable tomes that yet another novel, which gives it pride of place would, one imagines, invite more intense critical attention than most.But Timeri N. Murari’s grand Raj production (for that is how this sequel to The Imperial Agent comes across) will probably get away unscathed. Its meticulously researched historical backdrop notwithstanding, the book adroitly escapes being judged by the criteria that would apply to a historical novel. The thoroughness of this research is evident as the author weaves his suspense-charged fictional episodes around real-life events — among them, World War I and the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre — and smoothly incorporates personalities like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru into his narrative, making them come alive in imagined sequences, even if there is a tendency towards stereotyping in the delineation of such characters as General Reginald Dyer of Jallianwallah Bagh notoriety who vows to “teach the bloody wogs a lesson they’ll never forget”.Murari’s most inspired writing comes, however, from his portrait of another India, the one that happily accommodates demons and double agents, patriot-terrorists turned “
sanyasis” and brigands who rule the Chambal’s ravines, island palaces and temples to the snake god, hired assassins lurking in the shadows and zamindars who conspire from their thrones of ivory “the colour of fading sunlight”, evil spells and local superstitions and, of course, those rare and wondrous beings, Bala and Bala, blind twins with the power to transform people and places through their magical songs so that they are never again the same. In other words, oodles of exotica that lend the story the innocent charm of a fairy tale, while playing quite unabashedly on the old Western fixation — perpetuated partly by Hollywood — with the Orient’s supposedly unfathomable mystique.Appropriately enough, the hero is an “
Angrezi” born, but Indian “by love and thought”. Resurrected by the author from Kim, Rudyard Kipling’s creation, Kimball O’Hara is “a friend of the world”, brave, honourable and compassionate, with an embarrassing resemblance to the yesteryear Hollywood heroes some of us had massive crushes on long, long ago and now condescend to remember with a self-deprecating smile. It’s inevitable that Murari’s Kim, who takes up from where he had left off in The Imperial Agent, should be required in this novel to elude assassins, battle dacoits, fight superstition, exorcise demons and stand up to his former mentor, Colonel Creighton, who swears by Rule Britannia and would, if necessary, betray his own protégé to safeguard the interests of the Empire.It’s no surprise either that Kim’s love interest should be the beautiful Mohini/ Parvati, the original damsel in distress who can, when required, be bold enough to engage in anti-colonial activities, flee a brutal husband, love a man from another race (even if her romantic interludes with him are frustratingly chaste), bear him a child out of wedlock and ultimately carry out an act we wouldn’t have dreamed her capable of, so weepy and whisper-soft has her creator rendered her, the perfect prototype, it would seem, of the demure Oriental maiden with great hidden potential.Add Murari’s rich gallery of cameos and red-hot action sequences interspersed with lyrical passages and you have a potent, if quaint, cocktail of entertainment.It’s not difficult to understand why this author’s popularity has endured over the decades, despite changing literary tastes. Murari can remain secure in the knowledge that The Last Victory offers much, including some great celluloid moments that will lure us into a willing suspension of disbelief so that going with the flow follows naturally. Despite the faint whiff of mothballs, there’s much to be said, after all, for a reassuringly linear narrative, larger-than-life characters, a generous slice of realism, both magical and otherwise, high-voltage drama and an assured prose style that adapts itself easily to the demands of the context and is as invigorating as a breath of fresh air.

Yann Martel's second novel has been a long time coming. Recently released in Canada and the US, 
Beatrice and Virgil
 has received polarised reviews. That it has been trashed as well as praised, he says, is a sign that it has elicited active engagement, not indifference, from the readers. The controversial reception is a sign that it is getting people to think and act, he says from San Francisco where he is on a promotional tour. Excerpts from a telephonic conversation...
Are you planning on coming to India to promote the book here?
I have a nine-month-old son. Before I can promote it — I am not going to Australia, New Zealand — I want to get back and be with my son. So, as much as I would love to return to India, for any reason, not just to promote my books, just to be in India — I haven't been there for about nine years now — I don't know when that'll be. India has changed a lot, I would love to go back and see that.
Is this novel about the primacy of the imagination? You think we live in a world where the profusion of facts is working against making sensible meaning out of it?
Reality is a 100 million details. Right now where you are, if you think about it, you are surrounded by 100 million details on which you could focus your attention. Everything, from chemical, scientific details to cultural details to personal emotional details... now some of that has to be lost. Time, you know, is an eraser. It all goes. [We need] something we can hold on to. It's called history. But even history has hundreds of thousands of details and sometimes it's overwhelming and it's hard to get to. The forte of the arts, the forte of the imagination is that it can take some of those details and give them immortality. A painting, a story, a song can float across the ocean of time like a lifeboat. So you can get to the essence of an event and convey it in the form of art. It can be like a suitcase, taking the essential and preparing you for a trip to elsewhere...
Does ‘getting to the essence' necessarily bring a moral perspective that is lacking in mere facts?
It can be but art isn't necessarily moral. Art could be immoral too. Art is witness. But in some stories, yes, it can also have a moral edge. It can also, in telling a story, convey certain moral situations. Which is what my novel does at the very end — In “Games for Gustav” are these 12 situations that are morally, existentially difficult. So, yes, it can make a moral situation fresh again...
You dwell at length in the initial stages of the novel about the concrete, everyday circumstances around writing /publishing that are usually glossed over. Is it autobiographical and are you saying that though there is a market built around imagination, it is essential to our being and identity?
I didn't do it because I wanted it to be autobiographical, it was more because of the idea of a writer who stops writing, whose message has stopped, suited me because I was discussing the Holocaust. And any great horrific event, the Holocaust, war, has a tendency to erase language, to make us at a loss for words. You know, famously, when people encountered the Accounts, their language was full of clichés to do with “there are no words to describe”, “I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing.” So, to have a writer who is at a loss for words and then to meet the taxidermist who is also in some ways at a loss for words suited my purpose when discussing the Holocaust...so that's why I have that theme.I did indeed have a meeting with my publishers, I did want to do a flip book with them but their argument was different. They were saying, “listen, an essay is a specialised product. A novel is not.” They were afraid the essay would drag down the novel.
You keep coming back to the notion that is art is about joy. The taxidermist is shown as someone who is joyless, cheerless, who plods through his play. “My story has no story. It is based on the fact of murder,” he says at one point. You think the character of the taxidermist is too steretypical, he and the novelist falling easily into opposite sides of a too-easy divide?
Art is joy in a general way. Any art, music, dance, painting, to create at that level is deeply joyful, it involves your whole being. Art and religion are the two ways in which we fully engage with life. In this particular case, I enjoyed wrestling with that subject. I wanted to make the taxidermist ambiguous. He clearly has some sort of a creative impulse, he is working on a play, he is quite rude with the writer. I wanted someone whom we wouldn't understand why he was doing the things he was doing until the very end and even then we are not sure what his intent was.And that to me was the parallel of the encounter of the Jews of Europe with the Nazis who did not see it coming. By the time they realised fully what the Nazis' intents were, it was too late, they couldn't escape and that's why so many died.
How has the novel been received?
It's been very interesting and very polarised. Some critics absolutely hated it. I got absolutely trashed by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and there's some blogger on the Internet named Edward Champion who absolutely hated it. And then you have reviewers who absolutely loved it. The USA Today thought it was positively a masterpiece. There were very positive reviews in Newsweek and the LA Times. So it's been very polarised, which is good. The one thing you don't want with art is indifference. You don't want people to shrug. Even when people hate it, they are engaging with it.
Is there some sort of thematic continuity or evolution between 
Life of Pi
 and 
Beatrice and Virgil

? If the former was about God, faith and religion, the latter is about imagination and art, isn't it?In some ways they are very different books. Yes, they both feature animals but that's just on the surface. In Life of Pi hopefully the reader loses himself looking at those animals. Forget may be his humanity. In Beatrice and Virgil those animals are anthropomorphised and are meant to bring us back to our humanity.And as for the role of the imagination, to me it's something more immediate like life itself is an interpretation. We cannot choose the reality we live in, but we can choose how we interpret it. In that sense, imagination is not something whimsical, fairy-tale like, I am simply saying that reality is a co-creation, reality is something which is out there but it is also how you take it. To that extent, I suppose there is a similarity between the two novels in the sense that how you represent reality will speak of how you see it, of what that reality is. A person of faith reads transcendendance into the world, sees a divine plan; I suppose it is the same with reading history. You are representing an event that is past, and in that representation there is an element of interpretation, of imaginative reading. In that way there is a thematic link between the two novels.
To me this novel seems to come behind a line of books from the West dealing with the Holocaust. Why this obsession in the West about the Holocaust? There are historical continuities to the Holocaust in the contemporary world like what is happening in Palestine, Gaza today, injustices, perhaps of equal magnitude. Nobody seems to talk about them much...
Well, aside of the politics of West Asia, which poisons everything, just looking in terms of history, the Holocaust still remains unique: every other genocide before and after has to some extent been politically expedient. The Armenians in Turkey were killed because they were in the way of the Turks who were trying to start their nation. Excesses in Gaza were committed because of political enmity between the Palestinians and the Israelis. In both cases you killed people who were in the way, who bothered you but the ones beyond a certain border were irrelevant to you. But the Nazis were obsessed with killing the Jews everywhere, as if they were a disease. That does remain unique. And the reason I think it is still relevant, not a piece of historical arcana from several years ago in the backwaters of Poland, is because what led to the Holocaust is still absolutely contemporary.The act of hate, the thinking of hatred, the disrespect in the mind of an individual that eventually in Germany led to the Holocaust, that little beginning, that seed of hatred is found everywhere. The Holocaust is not rooted in Auschwitz, in Poland. It is rooted in the human heart. And that applies to India too. There are people in India with holocaustal thinking, for example the BJP, the Shiv Sena, you know, that kind of hatred of the other whom you don't even know, who is just a construction in your mind to relieve tension, to relieve whatever... that is holocaustal. Now because India is democracy, there is a free press, it is unlikely that there will ever be a genocide but the roots are there...The thing about this novel is that it is not an orthodox Holocaust novel. There is no history in there, there are no Germans, there is minimal reference to the Holocaust yet it is soaked in it.So I do choose the Holocaust but not just as a historical artefact, I am looking at what is to me relevant. At the very end, there are 12 more situations where there is no historical colour or detail that put you at the heart of it. And those 12 situations could take place in India. You could be in a line of people about to be executed and you could be holding your grand daughter's hand and she asks you a question. And what might that question be? What would a child be thinking when it sees people being massacred? That completely fits in with realities in India today. That's why I think it's still relevant...
Exclusive excerpts from Yann Martel's 
Beatrice and Virgil

…
(Virgil and Beatrice are sitting at the foot of the tree. They are looking out blankly. Silence
.)
Virgil: What I'd give for a pear.

Beatrice: A pear?

Virgil: Yes. A ripe and juicy one.

Beatrice: I've never had a pear.

Virgil: What?

Beatrice: In fact, I don't think I've ever set eyes on one.

Virgil: How is that possible? It's a common fruit.

Beatrice: My parents were always eating apples and carrots. I guess they didn't like pears.

Virgil: But pears are so good! I bet you there's a pear tree right around here. (He looks about.)

Beatrice: Describe a pear for me. What is a pear like?

Virgil: (settling back) I can try. Let's see . . . To start with, a pear has an unusual shape. It's round and fat on the bottom, but tapered on top.

Beatrice: Like a gourd.

Virgil: A gourd
? You know gourds but you don't know pears? How odd the things we know and don't. At any rate, no, a pear is smaller than an average gourd, and its shape is more pleasing to the eye. A pear becomes tapered in a symmetrical way, its upper half sitting straight and centred atop its lower half. Can you see what I mean?
Beatrice: I think so.

Virgil: Let's start with the bottom half. Can you imagine a fruit that is round and fat?

Beatrice: Like an apple?

Virgil: Not quite. If you look at an apple with your mind's eye, you will notice that the girth of the apple is at its widest either in the middle of the fruit or in the top third, isn't that so?

Beatrice: You're right. A pear is not like this?

Virgil: No. You must imagine an apple that is at its widest in the bottom third.

Beatrice: I can see it.

Virgil: But we must not push the comparison too far. The bottom of a pear is not like an apple's.

Beatrice: No?

Virgil: No. Most apples sit on their buttocks, so to speak, on a circular ridge or on four or five points that keep them from falling over. Past the buttocks, a little ways up, there's what would be the anus of the fruit if the fruit were a beast.

Beatrice: I see precisely what you mean.

Virgil: Well, a pear is not like that. A pear has no buttocks. Its bottom is round.

Beatrice: So how does it stay up?

Virgil: It doesn't. A pear either dangles from a tree or lies on its side.

Beatrice: As clumsy as an egg.

Virgil: There's something else about the bottom of a pear: most pears do not have those vertical grooves that some apples have. Most pears have smooth, round, even bottoms.

Beatrice: How enchanting.

Virgil: It certainly is. Now let us move north past our fruity equator.

Beatrice: I'm following you.

Virgil: There comes this tapering I was telling you about.

Beatrice: I can't quite see it. Does the fruit come to a point? Is it shaped like a cone?

Virgil: No. Imagine the tip of a banana.

Beatrice: Which tip?

Virgil: The end tip, the one you hold in your hand when you're eating one.

Beatrice: What kind of banana? There are hundreds of varieties.

Virgil: Are there?

Beatrice: Yes. Some are as small as fat fingers, others are real clubs. And their shapes vary too, as do their taste.

Virgil: I mean the regular, yellow ones that taste really good.

Beatrice: The common banana, M. sapientum
. You probably have the Gros Michel variety in mind.
Virgil: I'm impressed.

Beatrice: I know bananas.

Virgil: Better than a monkey. Take the end tip of a common banana, then, and place it on top of an apple, taking into account the differences between apples and pears that I've just described.

Beatrice: An interesting graft.

Virgil: Now make the lines smoother, gentler. Let the banana flare out in a friendly way as it merges into the apple. Can you see it?

Beatrice: I believe I can.

Virgil: One last detail. At the very top of this apple-banana composite, add a surprisingly tough stalk, a real tree trunk of a stalk. There, you have an approximation of a pear.

Beatrice: A pear sounds like a beautiful fruit.

Virgil: It is. In colour, commonly, a pear is yellow with black spots.

Beatrice: Like a banana again.

432,Questions of identity,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,18:49:20 IST,"Aatish Taseer's The Temple-goers
  The narrator of Aatish Taseer’s debut novel is a young man named Aatish Taseer, and some of the details of his life appear drawn from the author’s. The device is guaranteed to raise questions about exactly how “autobiographical” The Temple-goers is (as if such things are neatly quantifiable), but that would be to miss the wood for the trees; this is a book that encourages us to ask subtler – and more interesting – questions about identity.The fictional Aatish is a young writer born to privilege. After a few years studying and working in America and England he’s just returned to Delhi to revise a novel, and he has access to two apartments – his mother’s and his girlfriend Sanyogita’s – in the high-end colonies that border Lutyen’s Delhi. A citizen of the world, Aatish is estranged from non-cosmopolitan India, and always conscious of – and uneasy about – this estrangement.This is reflected early on, in the book’s descriptions. When he writes about places like Jorbagh and Lodhi Gardens, he does it with precision and familiarity. But he’s on less firm ground with other parts of Delhi, including its growing satellite towns, and the novel is deliberately non-specific about those parts. Instead of Noida or Ghaziabad, they are given the abstract names “Sectorpur” and “Phasenagar”. The impression one gets is of a city map where the posh colonies of south-central Delhi are in sharp relief but the names get blurred as the map spreads outwards, until the satellite towns are anonymous smudges: unknowable and frightening places to someone who has led a sheltered life.We are prepared, then, for the fascination Aatish feels towards the book’s other major figure, a fitness trainer named Aakash who lives in a lower-income-group flat in Sectorpur. “Double A like me!” Aakash exclaims when he learns Aatish’s name, the first time they meet, but gradually we will come to see how Aakash himself is something of a double, a doppelganger for our narrator. He’s a developed character in his own right, but it’s also possible to see him as a figure born in Aatish’s subconscious, threatening and attractive in equal measure. As a high-caste Brahmin, seemingly very sure of his place in the world, he is an object of envy, and Aatish’s descriptions of him have a ring of awe (“His small, powerful body hovered over mine, the rope of black religious strings hanging down like a noose…”). When he shows up – as a security guard – at an upper-crust Holi party where Aatish is a guest, and later, when he invites himself to Aatish’s flat, there is a hint of rupture, of one world intruding on another.Their improbable friendship deepens: Aatish goes on a day trip with Aakash and his family to an ancestral village temple; later, he accompanies him to the home of a middle-aged prostitute where they share a different sort of intimacy. Aatish’s interest in his new friend’s life may suggest a novelist collecting material for his next book, but it’s just as likely that he is trying to understand himself and the country he wants badly to belong to.
The Temple-goers is a carefully crafted book in which even seemingly marginal scenes (such as a description of a writers’ meet where a young man reads out a short story that may or may not be an account of a real-life incident) become significant in retrospect. This carefulness can also be seen in its examination of identity – national, communal and personal.In his first book Stranger to History, Taseer – whose estranged father is a Pakistani Muslim – described his journeys through various Islamic countries to try and understand how the religion manifests itself in different places. The Temple-goers is, in part, a complementary examination of Hinduism, a religion that had pagan roots and was not founded on a fixed belief system; the repercussions – good and bad – of this fluidity; and the growing danger of it being overtaken by fundamentalist forces today.At one point, Aatish’s Urdu teacher Zafar uses the word “
vehshat” to describe India’s “history of animalism and sacrifice”, which he associates with the majority religion. “The land is stained,” he says, “It has seen terrible things: girl children sacrificed, widows burned, the worship of idols.” We are reminded of his words in a later passage set during a jagran, where the master of ceremonies cheerfully tells a story involving the sacrifice of a young boy – and still later, when a gruesome murder takes place in Sectorpur.But it’s equally clear that this is just one perspective, and The Temple-goers offers us others. In one very entertaining passage, ideas of India are bandied about at a dinner party where a V.S. Naipaul-like figure – a writer named Vijaipal – holds centre-stage. Responding to the popular liberal-intellectual stand that India isn’t really a single country at all – that the common man from Gujarat, Assam or Tamil Nadu wouldn’t have the faintest idea of India as a land – this writer declaims that the temple-going Indian “knows this country backwards. He forever carries an idea of it in his head…He knows it through its holy places…there is almost no other country, certainly not one so vast, where the countrymen are as acquainted with the distant reaches of the land through their pilgrimages as they are in India”.Persuasive though this monologue is, the reader might well wonder whether this generic “temple-goer” really is a pan-Indian creature or if what we’re talking about here is again a very specific variety of north Indian religious chauvinism. But then, one of this book’s achievements is that it presents forceful ideas without necessarily throwing in its lot with any of them. The fictional Aatish may have a clear sense of what the future will hold for Indians like him – and for Indians like Aakash – but the real Taseer doesn't give us a broad, over-simplified view of a vast, contradiction-ridden country.

433,The other side of history,ABDULLAH KHAN,2010-05-06,18:46:32 IST,"Susan Abulhawa's book
  The creation of Israel, for Jews, was the fulfilment of 3000 years of yearnings for a Jewish homeland. For Palestinians, it was El Nakba, the catastrophe, which rendered them homeless and forced them, to live in perpetual misery. The Jewish version of the Israel-Palestine story has found a place in English fiction umpteen times; the most popular being Exodus by Leon Uris, a book that generated a huge wave of sympathy in the U.S. for the state of Israel. But there was no novel of mass appeal originally written in English, on this issue from the Palestinian perspective until Susan Abulhawa decided to write one. 
The catastrophe Mornings in Jenin opens in 1941 and centres on a Palestinian family, the Abulhejas, a happy farming family in a picturesque and serene village named Ein Hod near Haifa. But their happiness comes to an abrupt end with the birth of Israel seven years later, as they are forcibly evicted from the land of their forefathers and made to live in a refugee camp in Jenin.  In Jenin, Amal Abulheja, the chief protagonist, is born. With her, we embark on a journey through the tumultuous history of post-1948 Palestine. In between, we also witness the personal losses Amal suffers: her father goes away never to return, her mother becomes insane, her husband is killed in a bombing, her sister-in-law and niece are slaughtered during a massacre and much more. When the journey ends after 325 pages, we are left wondering: How can someone be so brutal to his fellow human beings? How can the victims of a Holocaust metamorphose overnight into the instigators of a catastrophe? How do some people not lose their humanity even in times of extreme adversity? Of course, the book is a work of fiction but the events, from the forceful dispossession of Palestinians in 1948 to the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982, are facts, and many real people inhabit this story of heartbreak, exile, and human tragedy.
Poetic prose
What struck me most is the honesty of the author’s voice. Despite being born to Palestinian refugees of the Six Day War of 1967, she has tried hard not to let her personal feelings fill the text. All individual Jewish characters are portrayed in sympathetic light. Nowhere in the story has she lost the touch of humanity. Another bright aspect of Susan’s writing is her ornamental use of language in the tradition of contemporary Arabic writing. For instance, here is a taste of the opening paragraph from the chapter, ‘‘The Harvest’’: In a distant time, before history marched over the hills and shattered present and future, before wind grabbed the land at one corner and shook it of its name and character, before Amal was born, a small village east of Haifa lived quietly on figs and olives, open frontiers and sunshine. In the nutshell, it is a remarkable novel, which will help us to understand the Israel-Palestine conflict better.

  | Photo Credit: sumanaspati 
“Suddenly there came through the open window the sound of sweet music. Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust. And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, “Go on, little nightingale, go on.”
The nightingale in Hans Christian Andersen's tale is iconic of the life-spirit story-telling has always been.Andersen also foresaw through the tale the fate of genuine art, thought and expression. Earlier in the story, a toy nightingale which always sings the same song in the same vein gets an overwhelming approval rating from his crafty courtiers and his people. The problem: None of them had heard a real nightingale!It is like the fate of classic writings and great literature today. The massive difference in the situation from just a couple of decades ago is striking. To see the real collapse however you will have to peep a little into the vernacular world of contemporary Telugu publishing and reading, and ratings!Why do the classics matter at all? Gandhi Annapaneni realised the difference they make to society during his two years stay as an international student in the erstwhile Soviet Russia. The lack of translations of classic writings especially from the sciences and social sciences in local languages throughout Africa and Asia was a glaring contrast from the situation in Europe. “Accessing and understanding the great ideas and concepts through your own language matters a lot in creating a sturdy intellectual foundation and building up native confidence,” says Gandhi. Considerable good work was done in the decades preceding and following independence in many languages in India but it was primarily focused on bringing in literary works. Even that has become a trickle now.Remarkably, Gandhi's cherished project took shape and evolved amidst such exceedingly adverse climate. By that time sales of ‘serious' Telugu books had plummeted dramatically. Telugu publishing houses had to survive, as they still do, on a hot-mix of vaastu, astrology, religion, personality development and books for competitive exams.The range and variety of the 58 well-translated and attractively produced books in Telugu which Gandhi has brought out in the last five years under the Peacock Classics label, aided of course by a small band of friends and well-wishers, comes as an exceedingly pleasant delight. It is a fine mix of philosophy, science, constitutional law, mythology, folk tales, children's literature and literary classics — ancient, medieval, modern, Indian and foreign. Finding suitable translators who could bring out the essentials of the original in lucid and contemporary Telugu was the most difficult task Gandhi had to face. His persistence shows in the results.Sales figures, though un-encouraging, have not disappointed Gandhi too much. Kaalam Katha, a translation of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time for instance has had seven editions (each 1000 copies). About ten titles including Amma (Maxim Gorky) have done modestly well. The books are priced reasonably. “Yet, most of the target audience for these books, especially in the student community either do not have the resources or are unwilling to spend on books”, feels Gandhi.“The public library system in Andhra Pradesh is no more what it used to be yet there are still 1500 functional libraries spread over the state. So we are inviting people who feel passionately about Telugu and good books in Telugu to pick any work choose any title of their choice from a list of 40 books. The books will be reprinted (with the donor's name) and the copies donated directly to the public libraries,” reveals Gandhi.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Connecting-to-the-classics/article16298720.ece

  My Name is Gauhar Jaan!- The Life and times of a musician, the biography of the first Indian who recorded her voice, was released by Governor of Andhra Pradesh E.S.L. Narasimhan in Chennai on Wednesday.“Reading the book left me with a strange mix of sadness and happiness,” said the Governor.“When Gauhar Jaan excels, you feel happy and when she goes through pangs of separation, pangs of deprivation you feel sad,” he said, adding that the author's in-depth research into various aspects and places is in fact mind boggling, given the constraints of availability of time/material and far flung places.The Governor said “books like these bring back history to the modern generation and provide you a sense of pride in your rich heritage and culture and does leave an impact on the reader.”N. Murali, Senior Managing Director, Kasturi & Sons Ltd, said the book was in line with the current trend of documenting the life of great musicians, while earlier it was considered that art was higher than the artists.“Gauhar Jaan used technology to liberate herself from the exploitation in the hands of patrons of arts. She really democratised music and she was ahead of her time,” he said, recalling how male musicians of earlier days refused to record their voice fearing that doing so would affect their voice.Author of the book Vikram Sampath said Gauhar Jaan visited Chennai in 1910 and her concert in Victoria Hall was a great success. Enthralled by her music, Veena Dhanammal hosted a dinner and she even taught her a Thyagaraja Keertha in suruti raag. Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar learnt a few bhajans from her. She cut close to 600 records. V.

  | Photo Credit: Judi Bottoni In a rare coincidence, researchers working in both Turkey and Iran discovered on the same day how a rare species of bee builds its nest with petals of pink, yellow, blue and purple flowers.The females from the solitary species Osima (Ozbekosima) avoseta line the nest's brood chambers with petals that provide nutrients for the larvae to grow and mature and protect the next generation as they wait out the winter.“It was absolute synchronicity that we all discovered this uncommon behaviour on the same day,” says Jerome Rozen, curator in the division of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History.“In this species, a female shingles the wall of her brood chambers with large pieces of petals or with whole petals, often of many hues,” says Mr. Rozen.“Unfortunately, her larvae never enjoy the brilliant colours of the nest's walls because they have no eyes - and, anyhow, they would need a flashlight!” he said.Mr. Rozen and colleagues were working near Antalya, Turkey while another group of researchers were in the field in Fars Province, Iran.“I'm very proud of the fact that so many authors contributed to this paper,” Mr. Rozen said.Bees are the most important animal pollinators living today and many flowering plants depend on them to reproduce.But nearly 75 percent of bee species - there are about 20,000 species described - are solitary.This means that for the majority of bees, a female constructs a nest for herself and provisions each chamber in the nest with food for the larval stage of her brood.When each chamber is ready, the female deposits an egg and closes the nest if there is only one chamber to a nest, says a release of the American Museum of Natural History.The nests - found in the open - need to be protected from any number of potential threats to their physical structure like compaction of the soil, desiccation, or excessive heating.The survival of solitary bee species also depends on protection from moulds, viruses, bacteria, parasites, and predators.The research was published in American Museum Novitates.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Bee-species-that-builds-its-nest-with-petals/article16298780.ece

During 12 years of follow-up, 125 husbands and 70 wives developed dementia, and both the husband and wife developed dementia in 30 couples.After adjusting for a number of factors, the researchers found that people with a spouse who developed dementia were six times more likely to develop dementia themselves than people whose spouses never had dementia. Men had a higher risk than women. Older age was also significantly associated with dementia risk.“Future studies are needed to determine how much of this association is due to caregiver stress compared to a shared environment,” said study leader Dr. Maria Norton at the university.“On the positive side, the majority of individuals with spouses who develop dementia did not themselves develop dementia, therefore more research is needed to explore which factors distinguish those who are more vulnerable.”“Given the significant public health concern of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and the upcoming shift in population age composition, continued research into the causes of dementia is urgent,” Dr. Norton said.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Alzheimers-may-be-ldquoinfectiousrdquo-among-spouses-study/article16298779.ece
439,Mammoths’ survival trick – anti-freeze blood,DPA,2010-05-06,17:42:07 IST,"Bronze sculptures of mammoths near Biathlon stadium Western Siberia. Photo: AP
  | Photo Credit: Mikhail Metzel Mammoths had more than woolly coats to protect them from the frigid conditions of their sub-zero stomping grounds, scientists have discovered.The extinct beasts had a form of antifreeze blood that kept their bodies supplied with oxygen in the sub-zero temperatures, according to a study of DNA extracted from 43,000-year-old mammoth remains.A genetic adaptation in the woolly mammoths' haemoglobin - the molecular cage that carries oxygen in the blood - allowed them to thrive at high latitudes without losing much heat.Ancestors of the woolly mammoth originated in equatorial Africa about seven million years ago, but populations migrated north more than one million years ago, in a period of Earth's history when climate change caused temperatures to plummet.Unlike modern elephants, which have evolved large ears and other characteristics to keep cool in excessive heat, ancestral mammoths survived by evolving ways of saving heat, such as small ears and tails.In the latest study, a team led by Kevin Campbell at the University of Manitoba in Canada found another physiological trick that mammoths used to endure the ice age. Campbell's team isolated haemoglobin DNA from a woolly mammoth recovered from the Siberian permafrost and compared it with genetic code extracted from modern African and Asian elephants.The mammoth's DNA differed in a small but significant way. Changes in one percent of the proteins studied showed that it took less energy for mammoth haemoglobin to release its oxygen into the body as it coursed through the blood vessels. “It literally allows their blood to run cold,” Mr. Campbell said.“Without this genetic adaptation, woolly mammoths would lose more heat in winter, and they would have to replace that energy by eating more. In winter, there is less food around, so it was clearly a benefit to have this.” The research is reported in the journal Nature Genetics.Current Arctic species, such as musk ox and reindeer, have evolved a similar antifreeze system independently.Mr. Campbell said the work shows how paleobiology - broadly the study of ancient, extinct life - has come of age. “We resurrected mammoth haemoglobin. It's no different from going back 40,000 years in a time machine and taking a blood sample from the animal.”Michi Hofreiter, a co-author of the study at the University of York, said: “Our study is the first one to reconstruct an evolutionary important, adaptive trait from an extinct species using ancient DNA. It therefore opens up the possibility to build up a much more complete picture of morphology, physiology and evolutionary adaptations than would be possible using non-molecular study of fossil bones.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Mammothsrsquo-survival-trick-ndash-anti-freeze-blood/article16298778.ece

  | Photo Credit: Matt Rourke An international team of agricultural scientists has found a way to boost the nutritional value of corn and prevent blindness among children.In Africa and other developing regions, corn is a major staple and hundreds of thousands of children become blind, develop weakened immune systems and die because of diets based largely on corn that lacks sufficient beta-carotene.Corn contains carotenoids, some of which the body can convert to Vitamin A. Beta-carotene is the best Vitamin A precursor, but only a very small percentage of corn varieties have naturally high beta-carotene levels.Marilyn Warburton and Edward Buckler, geneticists with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and colleagues identified genetic sequences linked to higher beta-carotene levels in corn, showing a cheaper and faster way to identify corn plants that will produce even higher levels.The researchers surveyed the genetic sequences of corn from around the world through association mapping, a method made possible by recent breakthroughs that accelerate the genetic profiling of crops.The genetic survey revealed natural variations in one gene sequence linked to higher beta-carotene levels, said an ARS release.These variations interacted with a gene identified previously, and the best variations of the two genes together led to an 18-fold increase in beta-carotene, according to Warburton.The report was recently published in Nature Genetics.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/Scientists-find-way-to-boost-nutritional-levels-of-corn/article16298786.ece

  | Photo Credit: Mail Driven by the multifaceted and intricate human emotions, Mohanmurli Talak is an abstract painter who has been arduously trying to capture the human emotion on the canvas.“Crises of human mind” has remained a pivotal subject in his paintings. The extensive use of light colours which is palpable in his works, Talak has carved a distinct niche for himself in the domain of abstract painting.Being a native of Chitradurga, the 52-year-old self-made painter has largely remained as an unsung artist for the people of his native district.Having exhibited his works in the prestigious art galleries including Y. B. Chavan Art Gallery, Mumbai, Lakshana Art Gallery, Chennai, and Chitrakala Parishat Bangalore, Talak has never undergone any formal course in visual art. It was his immense passion for painting that made him learn the intricacies of abstract painting.Talak uses simple, but varied textures to create his work. He meticulously makes efforts to ensure that his work has a soothing effect on the viewers. “Many people don't even understand the concept of abstract art, however my prime objective is to make people at least change their mood by glancing at my work,” he says.Profoundly inspired by the paintings of the classical painter Raja Ravi Varma who lived between 1848 and 1906, Talak emphatically believes that a painter can contribute towards social change.In the field of art for over 15 years, Talak says that he never had an idea that one day he would become a professional artist. Working as an accountant in a private firm in Chitradurga, he says that the biggest challenge for him was to quit his job to take up painting as a fulltime career.“It was not easy task to convince my wife of quitting a well-paid job, especially when I had an additional responsibility of a young son. Yet, I had a strong conviction for art that made me to go against all odds to prove myself,” he said.“I try to make that has an intimate feel, but also not look vulgar. You can portray nudity without being cheap,” he explains, about an entire series that he has done for one's private space.Talak, who has also created innumerable pen-drawings of historical monuments of Chitradurga, says that a painter through his works could help the place become popular among the tourists.Veerendra Heggade, the chief of Dharmasthala temple is also someone who appreciates his work. According to Talak, several of his works have made place in the Heggade's institutions.Talak feels that the painting exhibitions are gradually shifting their domain from galleries to internet. He has decided to develop his website and upload his paintings on internet for online exhibition and auctioning.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/Strokes-against-the-flow/article16298843.ece
442,Evolution of modern art,CHARUKESI,2010-05-06,17:38:15 IST,"Family on scooter: Sculpture at Cholamandal village
  Produced for the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysore, the two-part documentary ‘Modern Art in Tamilnadu' runs for about less than an hour. Yet it appears to have covered most of the vital aspects of the history of Tamil Nadu's art scene from early 1850. The documentary has been directed by Amshan Kumar, writer on films, whose book ‘Cinema Rasanai' is considered a pioneering work in film aesthetics in Tamil.The first part goes back to the genesis of modern art and covers its growth up to the 1960s. The then British rulers established the Government School of Industrial Arts in Madras in 1850 with a view to inculcating Victorian taste among art students. However, it was only in 1929 that modern art took firm roots in Tamil Nadu, when Devi Prasad Roychoudury became the Principal of the School.The statues of Mahatma Gandhi and the Triumph of Labour on Marina, sculpted by him stand testimony to Roychoudury's vision. He was mainly instrumental in inspiring a whole (young) generation interested in modern art and was responsible for establishing ‘Madras School' in the world of art.“There is an interesting story,” says Amshan Kumar. “Once when D.P. Roychoudhury was painting, the coffee he was sipping spilled on it. Students watching him thought that he would discard it. No, he ordered for more cups of coffee and poured all over the canvas and made it one of even tone. This shows his creativity!”It was then the period of K.C.S. Panicker, who took up the mantle of projecting modern art in Tamil Nadu. From water colour he switched on to oil painting. He was the one who laid great emphasis on the Indianness of our art. He founded the Cholamandal Artists' Village.Another institution that nurtured the artistic talents of students came up in Kumbakonam. The town, surrounded by mighty temples, provided ample scope to hone the artistic skills of students on the traditional lines. It was christened the Kumbakonam College of Arts & Crafts in 1962. According to Amshan Kumar, eminent artists such as S. Dhanapal, A.P. Santhana Raj, R. Krishna Rao, R.B. Bhaskaran, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and Alphonso Aruldoss served in both Chennai and Kumbakonam. Works of C.J. Anthony Doss, L. Munusamy, Krishna Rao, P.V. Janakiraman, Ramanujan and a few others are discussed.The second part covers the movement from 1970s till now. It carries the brief interviews of R.B. Bhaskaran, Alphonso Arul Doss, Achuthan Koodallur, K. Muralidharan, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and so on. Adimoolam's transition from black and white line drawings of Gandhiji to abstract oil paintings was as courageous as it was fascinating.
Figure distortion
Famed artist and art director P. Krishnamurthy's opinion that figure distortion, which arrived from the West after experimentation, was indeed introduced by the Indian artists very early on. Artists from the younger generation such as Aparajithan, Shilesh and Srinivasan also find a place with their works.While the English script for the documentary has been done by Lakshmi Venkatraman, the Tamil version has been handled by Amshan Kumar himself. A. Sarangan has wielded the camera and the voice over has been provided by Selvakumar.
Since the venue of the screening was the College premises, majority of the audience was students. Amshan Kumar answered questions posed by them.

Why the documentary chooses to be illustrative and not exhaustive in showing the artists?
“Being the first documentary that chronicles the entire history of modern art in Tamil Nadu, a limited time frame has its own charms and perils. I am not partial towards a few and biased against some of the artists. Duration of time decided the number of artists. Artists featured in this documentary are important, but those who do not are no less important. Inclusion of 50-plus major artists would have made the film like a catalogue and have done justice to none. My aim is more such films should be made and they should bring in artists who are not featured here.
Why did he make this documentary?
My aim is to demystify modern art since in the public mind it is thought of as abstruse and arcane. I think the film has achieved the objective, since many artists have explained their work in great detail and also worked in front of the camera. Viewers will feel that they are in the privacy of the studios of artists, watching as they work. I am grateful to all of them and the Central Institute of Indian Languages, as this documentary is first of its kind.Amshan Kumar has produced around twenty documentaries. They include ‘Bharathi,’ ‘U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer,’ ‘Dr. C.V. Raman,’ ‘Ashokamitran,’ ‘Badal Sircar’s Third Theatre,’ ‘Mangroves,’ ‘Tamil Theatre,’ and ‘Village Knowledge Centres’ among others. He made a feature film ‘Oruthi’ based on Ki. Rajanarayanan’s story ‘Kidai’ This was shown in Indian panorama and won an award, too. Amshan Kumar is currently working on a feature film.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/Evolution-of-modern-art/article16299906.ece
443,The salt stories,RANA SIDDIQUI ZAMAN,2010-05-06,17:08:15 IST,"V. Karthik and Sujatha Shankar Prasad
  While a few students are seen lost in their studies in the silent library room of the American Centre, it's off colour walls with a few aqua blue and mostly black and white photographs attract attention with a silence of another kind — the silence which a city-bred commoner probably didn't even care to listen to. Sometimes a picture doesn't need words to explain its content, but in the case of these photographs, words lend them a fairytale air, turning them into legends. It also draws attention to the most utilised, yet the most ignored ingredient in a household — salt.Two photographers, Chicago-based Sujatha Shankar Prasad and Chennai-based V. Karthik, chose to tell the tale of salt making from the mines at Marakkanam on the outskirts of Puducherry. Photographs detailing the process of natural salt making in the sun, as well as those of Chicago River reflecting images of the Chicago skyscrapers form this exhibition titled “Barking Tree and other places: Mythologies in the Landscape” at The American Centre.Says Karthik, “The salt mines at Puducherry play a very symbolic role for me — of free human spirit and Mahatma Gandhi. If you see these vast seascapes in summers, you will not find any human activity there. From morning to evening, salt gathers at the shores and the sun crystallises it, forming numerous, shining, uniform mounds. Landscape is hardly visible as salt forms the backwaters of the sea. Human activity happens much later when a huge mountain of salt gets naturally prepared and people from villages come to collect it. This is their only source of sustenance. And in my lab, every day I work with this water, light, shade and brightness. I could relate to the natural process.”
Interesting shots
Both Sujatha and Karthik took several interesting shots of the salt making process and the former has woven them into heart-warming tales. For instance, in a picture, an alert dog is seen sitting near a mountain of salt, almost guarding it, and a tree in the shape of a dog is called barking tree. A third picture shows a woman with a basket of salt heading homewards. Sujatha weaves them with a beautiful story that touches your heart.The prints are achieved using a traditional method no longer utilised. “Marakkanam are primarily black and white prints on fibre using traditional photographic methods from 35mm T max negative film. Tonal processes have also been explored in the colour prints for the Chicago River series, which were originally shot on Ilford XP2, a monochromatic film with a chromomeric base,” says Karthik.Says Sujatha, “In 1995 I took shots of the Chicago River on 35 mm and kept their negatives for ages. But as I wanted to take pictures out of them, they had lost quality. That's what brought me to V. Karthik in Chennai, who works in conservation and traditional photography.”The show continues till May 21.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/The-salt-stories/article16298769.ece
444,In myriad moods,K. Rajan,2010-05-06,16:13:44 IST,"Open to interpretation Rajan
  That artists should not imitate is Shilpi Rajan's motto. Therefore following a set of prescribed rules is, naturally, quite unthinkable for the renowned artist.“I never repeat my works,” quipped Rajan as he pointed out his sculptures, which were on display at the Kerala Lalitakala Akademi in Thrissur from April 28 to May 4. And true to his word, each of the 64 sculptures on show at the exhibition titled ‘Kalkkathal,' was unique. This was Rajan's 11th solo exhibition since he started sculpting back in 1984.
Self-taught artiste
The self-taught sculptor revels at depicting varying moods in the same sculpture. “Perhaps it is because I do not complete a sculpture at a stretch.“Although gloom would appear to be the dominant mood,the sculptures actually reflect my mood at that particular point of time when I worked on them,” explained Rajan.“As in life, a sculpture too cannot bear a permanent mood,” he added.What strikes one the most is the influence of folk culture in the sculptures. His human figurines bear clear traces of folk and tribal deities found in the State.Perhaps it is because the artist cannot escape the social milieu in which he grew up. As such, Rajan leaves behind a touch of his identity and originality even in his commissioned works.A wooden sculpture depicting Parvati and Ganapati and one of Koodiyattam maestro Chahchu Chakyar in granite are examples.Of the sculptures that were exhibited, 13 were in granite and four in laterite. None of them has been given a name. “The meaning of a sculpture cannot be contained in a name. It is for the viewer to interpret the meanings for themselves,” said the artist. There is one work though that is special to him, he said.It is a long wooden piece that depicts elephants huddled together, each standing on another and with a woman at the top. The message conveyed is that elephants are so gentle that they can be managed even by one woman.“It also signifies the inter-relationship between animals and nature,” he said.An eye that is not shaped well or a lip that is not in place does not seem to faze the artist and he appears not to be unduly worried about sticking to the norms of sculpting. Studying the sculptures of others, he said, was not of any value to him.“I feel that sculpture should not be taught. Rather, it should be developed in the course of one's own practice of the art,” said Rajan.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/In-myriad-moods/article16298757.ece

  | Photo Credit: Ajit Solanki India figures among the world’s worst 10 countries causing environmental damage, according to a new study which lists Brazil as the most polluting country.The research led by professor Corey Bradshaw, of the University of Adelaide's environment institute, has placed India at seventh position while ranking the U.S. and China as the largest carbon producers after Brazil.The 10 countries with the worst global footprint were Brazil, the US, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru, it said.Countries were measured on a range of indicators, including fertiliser use, natural forest loss, habitat conservation, fisheries and other marine captures, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat.The study, published in the science journal PLoS ONE Wednesday, found Australia's carbon emissions, rate of species threat and natural forest loss were the greatest contributors to its ninth-place ranking, according to The Age.“If you're clearing a lot of forests, you tend to also to overharvest in the ocean and use a lot of fertilisers,” Mr. Bradshaw said explaining the link between development and environmental damage.Mr. Bradshaw said finding the US and China in the top 10 were not surprising, though he was surprised that a relatively poor country such as Brazil took out the top spot.“The wealthier you are, the more damage you do, on average,” he said. “It's just a function of human nature. Growth is the be-all and end-all for all economies around the world, and if you're not growing economically, you're stagnant, and therefore that's a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that's unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Mr. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Mr. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Mr. Bradshaw said the better-ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven't wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we'd consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/India-among-the-worst-10-polluters-Study/article16298793.ece

With awesome prototypes governing the proscenium, the dancers moved onto a Manasi Varnam penned and choreographed by Lalitha Srinivasan pivoting around the pranks of Lord Krishna, the Geetopodesham episode with a musical composition by the late H.K. Narayana.Ajay Vishwanath, one of the seniormost students executed his metaphor brilliantly in the said piece. “Nritya Karnataka” concluded with a ragamalika tillana set to aditala aesthetically performed by the dancers executing square, circle to form the Sri Chakra concept.The Sufiana Kathak under the leadership of Rani Khanam from New Delhi followed next. With the dancer seemingly self-conscious, she tried hard to do justice to the items that she performed. The tihayis, the anahat and the concluding “Mohae apnae rang de rangilae” composed by Hazrat Amir Khusru in the 13th Century deserves special mention for their accomplishment in high aesthetic order. Bharat Natyam thematic duet by P. Praveen Kumar and Soundarya Srivatsa was brilliant. With the kritis, the javalis and the ashtapadis being intertwined into a thematic production “Shringara Lahiri” set to ragamalika and talamalika sung aesthetically by Srivatsa was a real treat to watch. Both the dancers proved their mettle in this evocative rendition.The plot complimented with Soundarya being mesmerised with the flute of Lord Krishna and Praveen in the limelight executing the advent of the Lord with an awesome amalgamation of jathis; it was executed flawlessly. With a peacock's feather as an imagery, Praveen with Soundarya as Radha complimented each other brilliantly on the stage. The “Radhae Brindavana Nilayae” set to raga Rithigowla was an outstanding performance. Abhinaya reaches an echelon of superlative when executed most naturally. Praveen and Soundarya's most natural, yet traditional abhinaya won the audience. In “Yahi madhava yahi Keshava” Krishna eventually manages to placate Radha. He even fulfils her desire to wear his kinkini. It becomes a grand metaphor with the mingling of the micro and macro.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/Intensely-involved/article16298844.ece
447,High degree of sophistication,VIDYA SARANYAN,2010-05-06,17:24:47 IST,"Meenakshi Srinivasan. Photo: M. Karunakaran
  | Photo Credit: M_Karunakaran The Kapaleeswarar temple has a unique aura that makes for an immediacy of the reach of the arts. And it was here that the Saraswati Educational Cultural and Charitable Trust had organised the Vasanta Utsav festival.On the inaugural day, the motley crowd could hardly miss the burning zeal and the high degree of sophistication of Meenakshi Srinivasan's Bharatanatyam. A disciple of Guru Venkatachalapathi and subsequently Alarmel Valli, Meenakshi has established a reputation for sincerity and expertise with her performances around the world.The programme planning and performance seemed to target the temple audience and factored in the absence of trappings such as the stage and curtain. Her recital that day revolved largely round Lord Siva and His consort. Abhinaya and nritta were given a balanced treatment. What stood out in Meenakshi's performance was the ability to create, communicate and sustain a particular mood without a single wrinkle.Thus the opening number ‘Ananda Natana Prakasham' in Kedaram could draw in the bliss as well as the contemplative nature of the Lord. The next number, a varnam, spotlighted the sringara aspect without losing sight of the divine nature of the beloved. Dhandayudhapani Pillai's ragamalika ‘Samiyai Azhaithodi Vaa' was interpreted as a dialogue where the sakhi's lack of comprehension of Siva's magnificence paved the way for the nayika to enlighten her. The choreography showed attention to detail: for instance, the Ardhanareeswara was depicted by contrasting the fiery locks of Siva with the long braid of the goddess.
Superb stamina
It was obvious that showmanship was a leading criterion here: following what seems to be today' s trend, the adavus for the theermanams were structured so that the artist was always hurtling around the performing space. One hardly got to witness a whole adavu; instead the long, complex patterns with different nadais were offered as incessant combos of different kinetic adavus. While one was full of admiration for the superb stamina and dedication of the artist (given that this is summer), one also wished some moments of calm had been built in.The abhinaya was a different story and there were numerous moments where one got to relish the artistic imagination. In ‘Jaya Jaya Durge', the goddess was revered not just as the vanquisher of demons but also of the evils within us. The contrasting images of raudram and vatsalyam were delivered with panache. Similarly, Meenakshi's involvement in abhinaya gave a lift to the Tamil piece ‘Dikku thereiyada kaatil.'It was in the thillana that the artist revealed her true mettle as the araimandi remained undiluted, the body lines stayed unfrayed as sollu alternated with the lines of the thillana as shudda nritta. The superb orchestral team of vocalist Hariprasad, Jaisri Ramanathan's nattuvangam, Kalaiarasan's violin and Vedakrishnan's mridangam galvanised Meenakshi's dancing to greater heights.The Kapaleeswarar temple resounded with dha dhindhinda… syllables not often heard in the Chennai air. As devotees turned the corner to the mandapam in the temple, the reason became clear. Kaveri Sageder and Sheetal Kolwalkar, disciples of Shama Bhate from Pune, were presenting a Kathak performance for the Vasant Utsav.For their performance, they used recorded music of high quality. The music ranged from the classical to semi-classical, and, in their words, 'world music'. Rather than stick to lengthy delineations of taal and its nuances, the duo chose short pieces with more of abhinaya content. Perhaps this was to ensure that the Chennai citizen got to comprehend Kathak better.
Dynamic rhythm
It was the dynamic rhythm presentation of teen tal that stole the show. The pieces revealed the dancers' competency in footwork and their control. The introductory number ‘Om Nama Shivaya' followed with the elaboration of teen taal was gripping and impressed the audience with some crystal clear footwork. The five inch wide ghunghroos, the slapping sound of the feet on the granite floor and the whirling skirts of Kaveri and Sheetal projected some weighty fare.Here, the two dancers presented the ginti, taatakar and taat which helped display their skill and experience. If one came looking forward to some challenging sawal jawab sessions, one left disappointed. For the rest of the programme turned out to be a collection of songs which although pleasing to the eyes, fell short on substance. While they offered some lively dancing, the really weighty points of the Kathak style were left unexplored.The abhinaya pieces came in quick succession and set a spirited tone. Maestro Bhimsen Joshi's bhajan ‘Krupa sarovar' extolled the compassion of Krishna and the Ganesha stuti rendered by Shankar Mahadevan reflected the creative bent of Lord Siva. But the Mahadev Sutaha became a piece more memorable for the noisy musical effects than the energetic dancing by the duo. The classicism of such features such as the wrist movements and the stylised walk were overshadowed by the light content of the music; sweet to see but powdery as snow. Even if the dancing per se remained undiluted, the end product varied depending on whether the music was classical or not.The tandav stood out for restrained delivery of Siva's synergy. This piece helped the recital stay on an even keel; the destructive and the creative aspects were powerfully projected through mime and pure rhythm. The finale ‘Vande Mataram' was well performed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/High-degree-of-sophistication/article16299937.ece

  Celebrations across the week for World Dance Day (April 29) saw Bharatanatyam star Chitra Visweswaran in a lecture/demonstration concentrate on the communicative strength of classical dance, the evocative snippets by her disciple Vijay Madhavan and Chitra highlighting aspects of rhythm, gesture and word, and how detailing in dance conveys the message to the viewer — thematic concerns like animals, natural beauty, writing, etc., not straying from the world of the young into esoteric poetry.Spic Macay's evening projection at JNU had the legendary Birju Maharaj weave his Kathak spell, the evening tracing, in Maharaj's inimitable way, how rhythm, implicit in every activity of creation, acquires a visual dimension through movement images and vocabulary of rhythm in dance. The earlier half of the evening featured an enthralling Kuchipudi duet by Raja and Radha Reddy, Raja's tandav brilliance in “Adenamma” in Paras portraying Shiva's dance counter-pointed by the lasya lyricism in “Sringara Lahari” in Neelambari, describing the gracious beauty of the Devi. singing by Sai Bhavani sustained the performance despite the absence of Kaushalya Reddy's authoritative nattuvangam. The disciples with daughter Bhavana participating, impressed in nritta exploration. For a welcome change, tarangam was performed to the Natabhairavi composition of Ravi Shankar.
Dance and value
Natya Vriksha's annual observance of the occasion at the IIC saw a vigorous seminar on classical dance and its values to society at large. Asking how one values value, keynote speaker, renowned dancer/choreographer Kumudini Lakhia, spoke of creating values in classical dances which come with inbuilt structure of values. Individual creativity demanded new interpretations, keeping respect for ethics of the form and its aesthetics sacrosanct — intellectual engagement with different sections of society becoming inevitable for dancers today, asking themselves “Why do I dance?” Quoting several philosophers from Kant to Freud, academic Krishna Menon, Associate Professor, LSR College, questioned the importance of art in an unequal society as an assertion of cultural sovereignty and political importance. As soft power appealing to other states, art, unless involved with people, cannot claim strong ownership or association.But can dance with the body (a most wonderful and also most vulnerable instrument) as medium be compared with other art forms while making assessments? With Indian dance history written on the woman's body, society, given all the renaissance, does not place the art form on the highest pedestal, a point emphasised through practical references from a lifelong career in Odissi, by Aruna Mohanty.Calling dance a Yoga which can open windows otherwise permanently shut in human beings, enabling a reinvention and renovation to upgrade skills which have formed traditional wealth of legacies, art commentator and Chairperson of APPAN Shanta Serbjeet Singh pleaded for respecting the likes of our Langas and Manganiyars and adding value to their creativity. Principal, Gargi College, Meera Ramachandran spoke of dance as the amalgam of all arts. Lata Vaidyanathan referred to the challenges of teaching “learning to learn', classical dance adding to the value of different types of intelligences, amidst Bollywood and all other popular culture. Malabika Mitra extolled Creator and the Created, being the same as in Nataraja.
The performances
That the best value is what comes as an irrepressible urge from the dancer's innermost being was shown by Pravat Kumar Swain, who, with his grace with assertive strength, angika exactitude, total immersion of being in the dance, was the find of the evening Young Dancers' Festival. Riveting Odissi by this 23-year-old covered mangalacharan on the Panchabhoota, Varshamisaran portraying the ecstatic response to first rains, and the delightful rhythms built round Konarak Kanthi — with the Thai Nata “Ta hamta hat tat ta” mnemonics of Debaprasad Das' creation woven into the choreography (making the audience sway) — and finally the natya-filled Ramayana passages of Hanuman in Ashokavan meeting Sita to present the choodamani. Wings led by Aruna Mohanty were competently manned with Vijay Kumar Brik (mardala) and Roopak Kumar Parida (vocal) and excellent violin and flute. This Gotipua trained youngster, for several years under Aruna, is a natural, and heralds a new era re-discovering the male body in Odissi.Shloka Vaidyalingam trained by the Reddys, gave a competent Kuchipudi presentation foot-sure in rhythm with fair abhinaya understanding, highlighted through the Ganapati invocation in Gaula, Tiruvottiyur Tyagiah varnam in Kedaram “Saami Nee Rammanave” with sringar interspersed with the rhythmic virtuosity of jatis led by Kaushalya's nattuvangam, and tarangam in Arabhi.Sneha Chakradhar's assertive Bharatanatyam with excellent rhythmic understanding (evident right from the alarippu in Tisram with mnemonics differently arranged from the conventional) and the Poorvikalyani Dandayudapani varnam “Saamiyai vara solladi”, was creditable for proven familiarity with the text from one not born to the languages of South India, barring words like “Bhoomi-pugazhum, and Kallatanam” which needed more elaboration.But while Nadanamadinar in Vasanta visualising the magnificence of the dancing Nataraja was fine in tone, the varnam, in the nayika's persuasion of the sakhi to carry her message of love to Kartikeya, would have shone more with some soft and more lyrical touches, contrasting the power.

  A Bharatanatyam recital by Keerthi Panicker caught the attention of rasikas at Vyloppilly Samskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram, for the youthful exuberance of the artiste. This up-and-coming artiste is a senior disciple of the Dhananjayans of Barathakalanjali, Chennai. All the items in her recital were choreographed by her gurus themselves.Keerthi began with a Ganapathi stuthi, a composition by Karaikudi R. Krishnamurthy. She moved on to another beautiful piece in praise of Lord Nataraja in raga Lathangi, set to Adi tala. Keerthi maintained an elegant approach in her presentation of this joyful dance, which according to myth, the Lord in Chidambaram performed at the request of the saints.Keerthi then took up ‘Nritypahaaram' varnam ‘Bhaavayami Reghuraama' by Semmangudi Sreenivasa Iyer. The piece, a summary of the Ramayana, was perfect in Keerthi's hands. Her movements and striking turnings had a scintillating flow and the whole story was conveyed with élan.Following this Keerthi essayed two challenging presentations portraying two totally different emotions of nayikas. ‘Netranthi neerathile,' is a padam in raga Lathangi that portrays the nayika's fury towards Lord Murugan, whom she sees at the river bank in the company of other women. Keerthi depicted the ‘khandita' nayika in this piece, which ends with the efforts of the nayika trying to convince her beloved to come back to her.The next piece in ragamalika is about a nayika (Radha) who is despondent over the ‘viraha' (separation) from Lord Krishna, and the nayika's conversation with her sakhi. Radha tries to draw a picture of Lord Krishna only to find that she cannot recollect his face.
Excellent depiction
These two absolute abhinaya pieces demand a lot of facial expressions and Keerthi has skilfully transported the theme to the highest level thanks to her excellent training. Her control over abhinaya in the two padams was absolute.Keerthi concluded her recital with a tillana in raga Behag. Also included in the programme was a thematic representation of a prayer to Lord Guruvayurappan by artistes from Bharathakalanjali.Keerthi was accompanied by Santha Dhananjayan on the nattuvangam. Buvaneswari Madhusudanan (vocal), T.N.

Kuchipudi maestro Vempati China Satyam was honoured with the State government's Natyacharya Award comprising a citation, shawl and Rs.50,000 in cash by the Tribal Welfare Minister P. Balaraju. His disciples offered Swarna Pooja to their illustrious guru, who has made the tradition find a prominent place in the international arena of classical dance.More prominent was the day-long celebration organised by members of the Nataraj Music and Dance Academy, founded and provided with a Kuchipudi teaching and training institute by Vikram Goud Bathina. It was launched with a two-hour workshop conducted by noted exponent Manju Bhargavi of Sankarabharanam fame. After this, tens of dozens of dancers in glittering costume representing fifteen forms of folk dance traditions gathered in the afternoon at R.K. Beach. They were all brought in procession to Gurajada Kalakshetram at which the main function was held in the evening.After a solo (Kuchipudi) performed by Sai Jyothi, leaders of folk forms of dances – Chekka bhajana, Tappetagullu, Kolatam, Dappu nrityam, Garaga nrityam, Burrakadha, Jalari nrityam, Veeranatyam, Jamukula Kadha and Chitikela kolatam – were honoured with mementos and cash awards. The chief guest for the evening, P. Balaraju, honoured Manju Bhargavi and conferred the title of Navarasa Natyakalamanjari on her.Next, a Kuchipudi dance ballet Sri Lalitha Nrityarchanam was presented by her disciples Veena, Dhanya, Kirthi, Hari, Vasanth, Madhav and others with herself in the lead. It was a translated version of Sri Lalithaashtottara Satha Nama Stuti in Sanskrit into Telugu by Rallabandi Kavitha Prasad. The ballet was set to evocative music by D.S. Sastry in nine ragas – Aarabhi, Kamavardhini, Hindolam, Sahana, Punnagavarali, Mohana, Kanada, Ranjani and Suddhasaveri – and the choreography by Manju Bhargavi was excellent.

He is a goal scorer. So he is our Wayne Rooney, I guess,” Horner said, comparing Vettel with the Manchester United and England striker Rooney.“I think Sebastian is the driver to beat in the championship at the moment. He is the driver in the best form with arguably the fastest car.”Asked to what characterises Vettel as a forthcoming champion, Horner said: “Number One is speed. Number two is intelligence and number three his personality. These are three major attributes that he has.“He is very straightforward. He is a very pleasant guy to deal with. He is a very intelligent driver. He knows what he wants from the car. He has a very good feeling for the car combined with a lot of natural talent. He is obviously very hungry and he is a big motivation within the team.”Vettel, 22, was runner-up to Jenson Button in 2009 championship and currently lies fifth in the championship with 45 points from four races, 15 behind the leader Button. The German won the Singapore GP but was stopped in leading position it the opening races in Bahrain and Australia by technical problems.“We have a very good car. In the first two races, Sebastian was in the position to win. If there were not the issues on Sebastians car he would have won the first two races,” said Horner.Horner named the championship “very, very open with three different winners in the first for races” and said that his team has all but ideal combination of drivers with the youngster Vettel and the experienced Australian Webber, who lies eighth with 28 points.“I think that we do have a very good balance in the team. We have got two guys in very different stages of their career. We have got a young, very hungry driver and a driver who is much more experienced.“It is a very healthy balance. They have a very professional relationship and I am very happy with the pairing we have,” said Horner.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/lsquoVettel-is-Red-Bullrsquos-Wayne-Rooneyrsquo/article16298746.ece

  Formula One fans seem to have lost interest in Michael Schumacher and favour Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher’s former manager said in an interview published on Thursday.However, the ex-manager Willi Weber also warned against writing off record world champion Schumacher, who is struggling in his comeback season from a three-year hiatus.Replaced by former spokeswoman Sabine Kehm as manager, Weber is still responsible for Schumacher’s merchandising and told Bild daily that sales are from those of the past.“Sales are not how I expected them to be. There is a certain Schumi-tiredness. The people are saying: my god, where is he driving? You only know him as a winner,” Weber told Bild.“In the past the tribunes were full of Ferrari caps. Now I can count the silver caps with one hand.” Schumacher won five of his world titles with Ferrari and came out of retirement for Mercedes GP this season on a three-year contract.The 41-year-old has had a modest season so far with just 10 points from four races.Weber said that the Red Bull driver Vettel has filled the void as German top driver.“Wherever I look, Vettel is the new Schumi, he is the number one in the TV ads and on the billboards. Michael has left a void and Sebastian has grown into it, because he has the success and Michael doesn’t have it yet,” Weber said.Weber expects an undisputed victory from Vettel at the next race on Sunday in Spain but is also convinced that Schumacher will rebound in the end and win again, even if it takes until next year.“I suffer with Michael when I see how he was passed down the ranks in China. But he will work until everything fits. If all goes well he will get a race win this season. But don’t write Michael off.

455,Picture of neglect,Suganthy Krishnamachari,2010-05-06,18:13:36 IST,"The Pazhuvettaraiyar temple gopuram in a bad state of repair.
  The Big Temple inspires one with a sense of awe, at its scale, grandeur and magnificence. But if you are looking for understated elegance, head for the Twin temples (Irattai Koil) of Kizhaiyur. These are two early Chola temples of stone, miniscule in comparison with the Big Temple, but enchanting, nevertheless. From inscriptions we learn that the temple complex was called Avani Kandarpa Iswara Griham. It was built by a Pazhuvettaraiyar chief, who was a contemporary of Aditya Chola I, and who bore the titles of Avani Gandharvan, Gangamarthandan, Kaliyuganirmoolan, Maravan Maladhalan and Araiyagal Araivuli. The Dwajasthambam was built by yet another Pazhuvettaraiyar- Ranamukharaman.According to S.R. Balasubrahmanyam, the earliest inscription in the temple complex, is of the 13th regnal year of Aditya Chola. But there are those who believe that this inscription is of a later period. This inscription records a gift for burning a perpetual lamp in the two shrines, under the orders of Nakkan Pazhuvettaraiyan Kumaran Kandan. Many other Pazhuvettaraiyars are mentioned in inscriptions in the two temples, and are also referred to as Maravar, Vadugar and Kaikkolar.(For admirers of writer Kalki, the name Pazhuvettaraiyar would have a special connotation. ‘Ponniyin Selvan' bristles with intrigue and vengeance, the Pazhuvettaraiyar Brothers behind all the trechery.)Inscriptions in the villages of Kizhapazhuvur and Melapazhuvur, which are just a few miles from Kizhaiyur, also talk of the Pazhuvettaraiyars. An inscription of the 12th regnal year of Parantaka I, seen in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple in Kizhappazhuvur, talks of the victory won by Pazhuvettaraiyar Kandan Amudanar, over the Pandyas, and their Ceylonese ally, at the battle of Vellin, in which the Pandya king lost his life. To commemorate this victory, the commander Nakkan Sathan made a gift for a perpetual lamp in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple.But who were the Pazhuvettaraiyars? Their origin seems somewhat of a mystery. The Anbil plates of Sundara Chola mention one of Parantaka I's queens as the daughter of “the Kerala King, who was called Pazhuvettaraiyar.” So were the Pazhuvettaraiyars from the Chera kingdom?The deity in the Kizhapazhuvur temple, has been sung of by Gnanasambandar, in the second Thirumurai, 34th padhigam. Verses four and eleven explicitly state that Malayali Brahmins were the priests in the Vadamulanatha (Alandurai Mahadeva) temple. Thevaram scholar Dr. R. Narayanan says, “In the Dharmapuram adheenam publication, the word ‘maraiyaalar' in verse five, meaning Vedic scholars, is also interpreted as ‘Malayali Brahmins.'” Thus although there was a Malayali presence in the Pazhuvur region, there is no conclusive proof that the Pazhuvettaraiyars were of Chera origin.The twin temples of Kizhaiyur, however, have not been sung of in the Thevaram. The Southern shrine in the Kizhaiyur temple complex is referred to in inscriptions as Thenvayil Sri Koil. An inscription of the time of Rajendra Chola says that two persons guilty of homicide had to surrender their land to the Kizhaiyur temple. Another inscription also of Rajendra I's time shows that provision was made for paying a ‘nattuvakkani'- dance master.The twin temples are West facing, and Umapathy sthapati says that it can be inferred from this that the temples were built for a special purpose. If there was a threat from an enemy, or if there were internecine quarrels in a community, or if there had been a famine, then a West facing temple would be built. This is true of both Vaishnava and Siva temples.Another early Chola temple complex is the one at Moovar Koil, but the difference is that in Moovar Koil, both the temples have the same type of sikhara. But in Kizhaiyur, the Southern shrine has a square sikhara, while the smaller northern shrine of Choleeswaram (now called Arunchaleswaram), has a round sikhara.Umapathy explains that whether it is a Siva temple, or a Vishnu temple, the sikhara and pattern of the temple will depend on the type of idol to be installed. If it is a Vishnu temple, then construction will be according to whether the idol is to be sayana, asana,or sthanaka. If it is a representation of a vibhava avatara like Trivikrama, then the rules of iconometry will be different, and the temple pattern will also be different.In the case of a Siva temple, one could have Nagara (square), Dravida (octagonal) or Vesara (circular) sikhara depending upon the Linga chosen. Usually, the sikhara will have to be in the same category as the Linga. Thus if a Nagara linga is decided upon, then the sikhara will also be Nagara.The idol of the Nandi facing the garba griha in the Southern shrine, looks reposeful. The folds of the skin at the neck make it look so lifelike, that one is almost tempted to touch it to make sure it is indeed a stone sculpture and not a real bull!
Brimming with energy
In the mukhamantapa, we find lion pillars. The lions seem to brim with energy, ready to spring on you. In the Vedas, the lion represents energy and the elephant beauty, explains Veezhinathan sthapati. Only animals and birds mentioned in the Vedas such as peacocks, swans, elephants etc. would find a place in temples, he says.Outside the sanctum sanctorum are four pillars, the tops of which can be made to rotate, according to a villager. He rues the fact that while until a few years ago, the tops of all four would rotate, now only one does. It was common for sculptors to display their skills by sculpting such pillars or by making a sphere in a yazhi's mouth rotate.In the mukhamantapa, is a beautiful sculpture of Siva and Parvati, which, unfortunately, is covered with oil, soot and grime. How can devotees be allowed to light lamps so close to the sculptures? There is yet another Nandi in a corner of the mukhamantapa. It is not clear where this came from.The northern shrine is also a two-tiered one, like the southern shrine. An inscription here shows that one of Raja Raja I's queens belonged to the Pazhuvettaraiyar clan. The inscription, of the 27th regnal year of Raja Raja, says that upon the request of his queen Nakkan Panchavan Mahadevi, the daughter of Avani Kandarpa Purattu Devanar of Pazhuvur, the king granted income from newly surveyed lands to the temple. The outer walls of both shrines have sculptures of Dakshinamurthy, Subrahmanya, and Brahma. Devotees have fixed huge bindis of vermilion and sandal on these sculptures.The vermilion powder might contain corrosive substances, which could damage the sculptures. But who is to make sure that devotees don't deface sculptures, in a temple that is unattended? Should a monument of this kind not have a guard?The brick and mortar gopuram of the complex is in a bad state, with plants growing on it. The yard is ill lit, and presents an unswept look, with bushes here and there. A board put up by the State Archaeology department lies uncared for on the ground. There is a ‘volunteer' priest, who doesn't seem to know much about conservation. It is a sad commentary on the regard we have for our treasures, when even a protected monument is in such a state of neglect.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/Picture-of-neglect/article16298790.ece

  | Photo Credit: V_Ganesan Just as Helen Keller said in many of her writings, India's visually impaired and much acclaimed violinist M. Chandrasekaran also feels: “It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision…” He adds: “My mother imparted a rich visualisation of the world, and got me inclined to the melodic world. When I look back, I feel even with eyesight, I wouldn't have achieved so much…”Chandrasekaran, rewinding to his initial days of hard work and resolve, brought in an overpowering sense of musicality to the conversation and enriched it with spontaneous serenades, explanations and demonstrations. “You have to get a face-to-face feel of my musical personality, only then can you write,” his modest expressions went on unrestrained.Struck by a severe form of jaundice even before he had turned two, his mother Charubala Mohan, a violinist, was forced to take a decision to get his eyes removed to avoid further damage. “My mother showed the nerve and fortitude to go ahead. “That was just the beginning of her determination… before long she learnt Braille and put me on a daily routine of Braille-and-violin-classes everyday,” recalls the violinist who lost his father when he was seven.Born in Kolkata, Chandrasekaran spent his early years in Kanpur, and has lived in Tamil Nadu (Tiruvaiyaru and later Chennai) for the last 65 years. “My mother says I could recognise ragas even as a three-year-old and was constantly humming, which provided a background to her mundane, household chores. It was difficult for me to hold the violin on my leg and use the bow. My mother moved heaven-and-earth for hours together everyday to see me balance the instrument and get the bowing mechanism right, ” recalls Chandrasekaran.Vocal lessons, as a rule, preceded his violin classes. Only after he mastered the sangatis and got the bhava right could he try it on the violin, he says. “You have to sing on the violin,” my mother insisted “and years later I realised that it had helped me bring clarity in my expressions.” Vocal music too became a significant constituent of his presentations and as a 11-year-old, he had already stepped on to the stage. In 1950, he received the Best Violinist Award (as a 13-year-old) from the Music Academy in Chennai. He continued his vocal lessons under Mannargudi Sambasiva Bhagavatar and Kumbakonam Vishwanatha Iyer. Later, he was trained in padam rendering by Vidyala Narasimha Naidu and even today he renders padam and javalis along with his daughter for Bharatanatya recitals, the recent ones being their Cleveland Festival performances.“It was during my growing up years that my mother often took me to the sacred festivities in temples and that's where my senses opened up to the sublime “Yadukula Kambodhi” and Gambheeranatte raga on nadaswara.” Chandrasekaran's Todi on the National Programme of AIR came in for appreciation by nadaswara vidwans of the late 1950s and the manner in which he essayed Kadanakuthoohala had Rajaratnam Pillai comment: “This hand is going to play lakhs of krithis.” Consciously, he was taken to the nadaswara style and the unique chemistry of the wind-instrument was also evident in his playing. The amalgam was palpable vidwans T.Chowdiah, Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu would often notice this.Chandrasekharan has accompanied an entire gamut of stalwarts from old-timers Ariyakudi, Maharajapuram Vishwanatha Iyer, GNB, Madurai Mani, flute Mahalingam to Dr. Balamurali Krishna, N. Ramani and the reigning stars of today. His solo performances termed ‘voco-violin' (with vocal renderings) have come in for appreciation although the master thinks, “accompanying has its challenges,” as he is known for his ‘deep shadow-follow' of the main artistes which requires a different mindset. And this painstaking focus has helped him deal with absolutely teasing pallavis, as also the age-old avadhana-pallavi set to more than one tala and simultaneously at that.Titles and honours run into several paragraphs for Chandrasekaran that include the Sangeetha Kalanidhi and the Sangeeth Natak Academy award and his profound gratitude to his mother has him running the ‘Charubala Mohan Trust' that honours music vidwans and conducts music programmes.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/The-song-paved-the-way/article16298846.ece

Manjunath (mridanga) in Bangalore.The performance, devoted entirely to the compositions of Muthuswami Dikshithar, included krithis in some rare ragas, the arohana, avarohana, and salient features of which were demonstrated lucidly, and handled with admirable felicity and finesse by the young vocalist. The opening number, “Kanakambari Karunyamrithalahari” in Kanakambari raga and tishra ekatala, was adorned with brief kalpana swaras highlighting the vivadi characteristics and jaru glides of the nishada and gandhara.“Mangalambayai Namasthe” in Malavasri raga and jhampa thala, beginning with the swarakshara ‘ma' in the tara sthayi was instantly arresting, and was followed by the beautiful krithi “Kumaraswaminam” in Asaveri.Sumadyuthi, generally equated with Simhendramadhyamam, was taken up for a short alapana that threw its unique identity and distinct ‘pa dha sa' usage into sharp focus. “Pamarajanapalini” was rendered with a few avartanas of kalpana swaras. The main raga of the evening, Shankarabharanam, was elaborated in a series of soft, mellifluous sancharas that combined spontaneity with technical virtuosity. “Akshayalinga Vibho” in mishra chapu thala featured an excellent neraval and kalpana swaras suffused with raga bhava at “Badarivana”, and was succeeded by a tani avarthana. The concluding item was “Sri Kamalambike Sive Pahimam” in Sri raga.The mellow majesty of the compositions and the uniformly sedate tempo maintained throughout, generated an effect that was different from that of the usual concert format in vogue. The accompanying artistes sustained and accentuated the underlying tenor of the recital with expert and appropriate responses. According to vocalist G. Ravi Kiran, the driving force behind Guruguhaamrta, the aim is “to preserve and propagate the singing of Dikshithar's compositions” through a series of concerts and lecture demonstrations, the material for which is sourced primarily from the “Sangeetha Sampradaya Pradarshini” of Subbarama Dikshithar.Along with clarifications about the musical form, explanations of the lyrics and their spiritual significance, and of literary embellishments such as rhyme, alliteration and assonance, and deployment of yathis and madhyamakala sahitya, which are integral components of the compositions, will definitely lead discerning listeners to higher levels of enjoyment and edification.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Rare-gems/article16298845.ece

  Kasturi Rangan's forceful and deep voice with waves of rolling akara conferred classical weight on his exposition in Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samiti's Bahula Panchami concert. Raga alapanas provided solid experience occasionally with excess vocalisation. Sancharas, deeply reflective, focussed on highlighting the radiance of the ragas, Sankarabharanam and earlier Pantuvarali.He freely let his voice unfold his manodharma and formulated its progress in vidwat idiom. With spells of inspiration, his talent combined smoothness of music's flow with the chaste characteristics of classicism. This lofty approach and relevant technique indicated the lines of his grooming.Melodic majesty was his prized performing base. This could be sensed in the many variations in negotiating the tara sthayi segment. This to a great extent explained the pulsating pleasantness.
Impressive and creative
Sankarabharanam (‘Yaduta Nilachite') provided the core of the recital. Kasturi Rangan's creativity couched in elegant twists and turns counted for its impressiveness. Vocal immensity exerted its influence on providing Sankarabharanam's panoramic edifice. A major part of development explored many levels of the raga's reach. The phrasings documented the moorchana boundaries and the akara-packed raga complex was gradually presented.The interpretative method well communicated the loveliness of the kirtana. The flow of the sangatis was set against the grandeur of the piece. It hit the right aesthetic areas, a method imbibed from his guru Seshagopalan's style. It would do him much good to convert imitation to emulation and observe restraint for artistic effect. The first taste of the concert at the start, the Aarabhi Pancharatnam ‘Saadinchane' whetted the appetite for the rest of the songs — ‘Sangita Gnanamu' (Dhanyasi), ‘Evarikai' (Devamanohari) and ‘Dunmarga' (Ranjani). The rendering of the kirtanas in general drew strength from exuberance packed in them.While overall the singing represented Carnatic flavour, Kasturi Rangan's Pantuvarali alapana was in the ustad mode. The kirtana was ‘Appa Rama Bhakti.' It was not a single factor that ensured the brilliance of the programme. Voice, talent, guru's influence and steadfastness combined to project Carnatic solidarity.As against the thrustful approach of the vocalist, V.V. Srinivasa Rao, on the violin, softly textured the ragas Sankarabharanam and Pantuvarali in his solo sessions. His play incorporated gentle touches to the sancharas and the economy in building Sankarabharanam was noteworthy, stressing the essence concerted more than elaboration. It was a very respectable face of Sankarabharanam that he delineated.Mannarkoil Balaji's mridangam revealed a style of play wedded to laya substance.

  A month-long festival of dance and music was held at Venkitachalapathy Temple, Kumarapuram, Palakkad in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam celebration at the temple. The festival was a fine blend of performances by renowned as well as up-and-coming musicians.
Kanjhangad Sankaran Namboothiri's concert was mellifluous. The Carnatic vocalist was accompanied by Subbaraman (violin) and Mahesh Kumar (mridangam).He wooed the audience with the Adi tala varnam piece ‘Neranammithi' in Kannada. His rendition of an alapana of Lalitha was scholarly. Then came Subhapanthuvarali and the Tyagaraja kriti ‘Ennaalluage.' ‘Ennaalluage' had a niraval at ‘Konnalu sakethapuravasa…' Clear diction and apt gamakas had the audience captivated during this piece. Mahesh Kumar brought the feel of this kriti alive on his mridangam. Namboothiri then took ‘Saragunapalimpa' in Kedaragowla for detailed exposition. It was laced with creative swarakalpana, which paved the way to a brilliant tani.
Sublime renditions

Cherthala K.N. Ranganatha Sharma's recital captured the attention of music buffs with his sublime renditions that adhered to tradition. Cherthala Sivakumar (violin), Kumarapuram Hariharalakshmanan (mridangam) and Deepu (ghatam) accompanied the vocalist. Gifted with a resonant voice, Sarma's concert was marked for his emphasis on clear diction. He began his concert with a composition by Lalgudi Jayaraman – ‘Neeve gatiyani' in Nalinakanthi (Adi tala). This was followed by Papanasam Sivan's ‘Thathvamariyatharama' in Reethigowla and the rarely heard Bhagavatar's ‘Saranam Vijayasaraswathimaye' in the raga Vijayasaraswathi. ‘Saranam…' had a scholarly swaraprasthara.An alapana of Poorvikalyani, ‘Thillai Chidambaram,' was laced with brilliant manodharmaswara. Dikshithar's ‘Sreevenkatagireesamalokaye' breathed an air of bhakthi to the concert. A rendition of Tyagaraja's ‘Swararagasudharasa' had a well articulated niraval at ‘Mooladharaja…' This was followed by an impressive tani.
N.J. Nandini, a promising young artiste captivated the audience during her concert with her vocal range and aesthetic modulations that reminded the audience of her guru Bombay Jayasree. Thiruvizha Viju S. Anand (violin), A. Ganesan (mridangam) and Vivek (ghatam) accompanied Nandini.She started the concert with ‘Vanajakshi' in Kalyani. Dikshitar's ‘Sreemahaganapathiravathuma' in Gowla came next. Pattanam's ‘Mariveredikkevarayya' in Shanmukhapriya was ornamented with fast paced niraval amd swarprasthara at ‘Sannuthangasree.'A well-rendered ‘Sreerangappuravihara' and ‘Ninnujappakarana' were ensued by a neat portrayal of Kedaragowla. ‘Saragunapalimpa' was marked by clear sangathis. A complex ragam-tanam-pallavi in Bhairavi ‘Avan en sonthamadi, Govindanadi, Mukunthanadi' and a lively swarakalpana was followed by a superb tani.
Rajeswari Satish, a disciple of maestros M.A. Venugopal, C.S. Krishnayyar and P.S. Narayanaswami took the stage captivating connoisseurs with her pleasing stage presence and crystal-clear padanthara. Sampath (violin), Anilkumar (mridangam) and Dipu (ghatom) accompanied her. She began her concert with ‘Valachvachi' in Navaragamalikavarna that was sung in two speeds and followed by manodharmaswaras. Rajeswari dedicated the song ‘Tharumo nin karunakataksham' to Krishnayyar; a song that he himself composed in Saranga. A charming ‘Ninnenammithinayya' in Simhendramadhyamam was followed by the highlight of the evening, a sparkling Bhairavi. Dikshitar's ‘Balagopala' was ornamented with a niraval at ‘Neelaneeradasareera…' Cascading swarasanchara was followed by a brilliant tani.A performance by flautist K.S. Gopalakrishnan with T.H. Subrahmaniam (violin), Surendran (mridangam) and Guruprasanna (ganjira) was memorable. Gopalakrishnan began the concert with an Adi tala varnam in Darbar ‘Chalamela.' Dikshitar's ‘Mahaganapathim' in Natta had dazzling swaraprasthara. The violinist who was in tune with the flautist added allure to the concert. A crisp rendition of ‘Nadathanumanisam' in Chithranjani was followed by a leisurely alapana of Hindolam, ‘Govardhanagiresam.' It was laced with scintillating swara passages.The highlight of the concert was the luxurious treatment of Thodi. Short and crisp phrases and alternate playing between the flautist and violinist delighted the audience. A lively tani preceded a well-articulated niraval and swarasanchara. Gopalakrishnan wound up his concert with ‘Bhagyadalakshmi baramma' of Purantharadasa in Madhyamavathi.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Fine-blend-of-ragas/article16299075.ece

  | Photo Credit: N_SRIDHARAN Shantanu Bhattacharya's concert captured moments, where one could savour his guru. His performance included the repertoire of his first guru Prasun Bannerji, and had the makings of a scintillating session with Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty , in the great style of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Sahib. Shantanu performed with exuberance the challenging intricacies of the Patiala Gharana.The morning at the Little Play Coop began with the melodic strains of ‘Gunkali' in vilambit, madhya and dhrut laya, where the last piece , “Gao Gunkali Gunijan Mein Gao” showcased a wide variety in expression and technique.
Distinctive alaps
Miyan ki Todi was full of distinctive alaps, which spilled into three-four avartans in full meend and uchhals.He touched the higher notes, lacing them with bol-alaps and created a melody substantiating the raga in a great tradition. The taan patterns were varied and spectacular, restating and redefining the heights that an Ustad usually reaches. In short, Shantanu's performance was a picture-perfect recital reminiscent of his great musical lineage.The second half of the concert was an interactive session, during which Shantanu took ragas with similar swaras but with varying moods such as Jaunpuri and Darbari; Bihag and Maru Bihag; Multani and Miyan ki Todi and Bhopali and Deshkar. He spoke about the strong correlation between the time of the enunciation of the raga and its swaras- a correlation, he pointed out, that actually helped to unfurl a particular raga.For example in the raga Miyan ki Malhar, the combination of ‘ni dha ni sa' dramatises and denotes the coming of clouds. He also felt that Bahar cannot be sung, unless it is Spring and that Bhairav can never be performed in the evening. He also pointed out that occasionally, the composition hailed the ragas. Finally with the coming of Bhairavi, Shantanu demonstrated how all the thaats with their scales can be derived by shifting scales by one note.The two beautiful compositions from Bhairavi finally established that Shantanu had scaled great heights and finally would cement his place among India's top singers. On the tabla was Debashish, a prolific master of his genre and the two complimented each other perfectly.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Recital-upholds-musical-lineage/article16298787.ece

Murali, Senior Managing Director, Kasturi and Sons, and president, Music Academy, released the CD, the first copy of which was received by Umayalpuram Sivaraman. Vedavalli, T.M Krishna and D.R. Santhanam, Senior Member, the Music Academy, were also present on this occasion. K.S. Sudhakar of Swathi Soft Solutions welcomed the invitees and said that it was a great honour to be associated with a project that was of immeasurable value to the whole community of musicians.Calling Vedavalli a matchless vidushi, Mr. Murali said she was holding aloft a tradition of unwavering adherence to sampradaya. Umayalpuram Sivaraman mentioned that “Pramanam” meant taking an oath of allegiance and Vedavalli was an authority on many aspects of music. He also appreciated her boldness and was all praise for the way Vedavalli had prepared her disciples to make them render these kritis in its pristine form.Krishna wished that this disc had seen the light of the day some 30 years ago and cautioned against the loose manner in which the word Sampradaya was being used, in discussing issues. He called the album an authentic document, which should be listened to frequently to gain familiarity. He requested Vedavalli to continue to release such CDs for the benefit of both musicians and rasikas.In response, Vedavalli said that the CD was an attempt to preserve a 150-year old tradition and that she was not compelling anyone to follow the bhani.Mala Mohan of Swathy Soft Solutions and Sumathi Krishnan, a senior disciple of Vedavalli also narrated the pleasant learning experiences they underwent while getting this CD to its present form. Smt. Pankajavalli read out a “Vazhthuppaa” as a tribute to Vedavalli. The event was efficiently compered by Shivapriya, Vedavalli’s disciple.There was a soulful rendering of some of the kritis by Sumithra Vasudev, Malini and Sumathi Krishnan to the accompaniment of Ram on the mridangam, prior to the commencement of this function.

462,First lady of nagaswaram,V. BALASUBRAMANIAN,2010-05-06,17:51:15 IST,"Nagaswara vidwan Madurai Ponnuthai in Madurai. Photo: S. James
  | Photo Credit: S_James. It is the third day of the Chithirai Brahmotsavam (Chithirai Peruvizha) of the Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. The simmering heat not withstanding, the milling crowd heads towards the temple and the asthana nagaswara vidwans are getting ready for their concerts. After the darshan, we set out to meet the octogenarian nagaswaram vidushi Madurai M.S. Ponnuthayi, once a regular at the temple festivals.Today, living on a paltry pension of Rs.1,000 and supported by her only son, this first lady of nagaswaram, who was once a sought after musician within the State and without, has turned philosophical and accepts life as it comes.Though she belonged to a family of musicians well versed in the flute, the violin and the mridangam, her father decided to train her in nagaswaram. Shifting base from their native village Ayakkudi near the Palani Hills, to Madurai, Ponnuthayi came under the tutelage of Madurai Natesa Pillai. The veteran recalls, “Classes would begin in the morning and would go on for hours. In fact, my guru was criticised for teaching a tiny girl.” The instrument requires plenty of lung power and energy to produce sound in a sustained manner for several hours. Hence, the nagaswaram was dominated by male players.
Rigorous practice
After classes, practice at home went on for hours. “These hours and hours of practice helped me overcome the initial struggle of even producing a note. My arangetram was in the 1940s. A huge crowd had gathered curious to see who the nine-year old girl playing the nagaswaram was, which hitherto was considered a male bastion. Soon the word spread and I was called to play as a supporting artist for many leading vidwans. Concerts with T.N. Rajaratnam Pillai, Tiruvengattaar and Tiruveezhimizhalaiyar are still etched in memory. I was just in my teens then!” Ponnuthayi has even played in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.“I played for AIR Tiruchi first in 1946 and this went on till about 1989. This helped a lot in my name spreading faster. Offers to play at temple festivals and marriage functions started pouring in. Naturally, I formed my own group comprising support nagaswaram, thavil players and talam. It was support from temples that helped sustain us. Getting noticed at such festivals earned us opportunities to play in marriages. I was never bogged down by the taxing schedules of temple processions which went on for 12 hours at times! As if to prove a point against my detractors, I withstood this strenuous schedule, thanks to the Blessings of the Almighty,” Ponnuthayi remembers and shows us some old photographs of hers with child-like enthusiasm.“My popularity grew beyond Madurai and I started playing elsewhere in the State. Once during a performance in Kerala, I received a medal from the organisers after I was pitted to play against a local nagaswaram player. Mind you, it was an impromptu competition.” She has played continuously for three years in the late 40s in Sabarimalai, as a thanksgiving to Lord Ayyappan, the presiding deity of the temple, whom she believes, saved her life when she was seriously ill during a concert tour of Kerala. She considers her concert at the Second World Tamil Conference a prestigious one.Ponnuthayi has many titles to her credit, the first being ‘Nada Gana Arasi' awarded by the Madurai Tamil Sangam and the last being the Kalaimamani. She values the appreciation of the audience during and after a concert more than titles and awards. “It is those humble words of appreciation that pep up the proceedings for me,” she says.
The master of Thodi
Her favourite ragam and player? “Thodi and TNR,” pat comes the reply. She continues, “Yes there are other ragams that I like but with Thodi, we can go on exploring its depths for hours. Again, TNR was the master of it.”Incidentally, Microsoft has taken a recording of Ponnuthayi's Thodi to be played at its headquarters in the U.S. under the category of Indian Music. Apart from M.S. Subbulakshmi, Ponnuthayi was the only other woman musician from South India to have been featured in an exhibition in Japan several decades ago. “An American girl Karisha King who visited this exhibition came all the way to learn nagaswaram from me for about a year.”Happily married to Madurai Chidambara Mudaliar, she went on to scale greater heights as he encouraged her tremendously. He was a Legislative Council Member for about three years and was part of the Congress party. It was after his passing away in 1972 that her professional life took a downward slide; engagements for playing in weddings abruptly stopped because of the prevalent stigma of a widow playing the mangala vadyam.About music then and now, Ponnuthayi has this to say. “We had to really toil hard to learn a kriti or a ragam. It took several months before we could master them. Today it is vice versa. Everything is available in capsules and is just a click away. Kritis are grasped at a rapid pace and forgotten as quickly.” She demonstrates by singing the Hamsadhwani varnam which she learnt when she was nine. The sruti alignment at this ripe age is something unbelievable.Her grandson Vigneswaran, a mridangam vidwan, has started learning the basics of nagaswaram from her. He teaches music in a local school and heads a group called Madurai Ponnuthayi Isai Alayam that gives Carnatic performances in and around Madurai. Ponnuthayi also teaches music to the locals there. Vigneswaran is planning to start a music school in his grandmother's name to perpetuate both music and Ponnuthayi's name.As Ponnuthayi blows the seevali to pose for photographs, we request her to play. But she politely turns us down saying she is weak. As this writer takes leave of her, he remembers the days when his father would tune in to AIR Tiruchi with difficulty just to listen to late night concerts of Ponnuthayi and make everyone at home listen to her.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/First-lady-of-nagaswaram/article16298782.ece
463,‘An artist is responsible for enhancing music quality',LALITHAA KRISHNAN,2010-05-06,17:31:34 IST,"Letting his deft fingers do the talking as they work magic on the strings, vainika Bonala Sankara Prakash is the walking, strumming proof that hard work pays. His music mirrors a rare blend of technique and aesthetics, strength and tenderness, creativity and accountability within the framework of tradition. The artist shares his thoughts on the present and future of the veena in the cutcheri milieu and the discipline that goes into the making of an artist.

Initial Steps…
I began playing the veena at age of five and gave my first full length concert at 9. My mother Ramani and father Bonala Jagannathan are veena and vocal vidwans. My father, who is my guru, remains my greatest source of inspiration. He imparted the subtleties of sampradaya sangeetham with emphasis on the techniques of veena playing. He was a disciple and close associate of the late Vasa Krishnamurthi, a legendary veena vidwan of the Bobbili tradition, renowned for four centuries. My maternal grandfather, trained in classical music, was also a mridangam artist in the bhajana sampradaya. He ensured that I stayed constantly tuned to musical thought.
Fostering the listening habit…
My father often took me to vocal and instrumental concerts of stalwarts, particularly the annual series in Vishakapatnam. Immersed in music at that impressionable age, I experienced immense joy. Those unforgettable cutcheris have been an everlasting source of inspiration for the contemplation and analysis of the myriad intricacies of melody, rhythm and technique, then and now.
Reaping harvest through sadhana…
Following the example of my father and guru who put in at least 10 hours of practice daily, I followed this schedule diligently for 25 years. Today, this sadhana stands me in good stead. Initiated early into manodharma aspects in a natural and phased manner, I find that its boundless creative scope gives me the highest satisfaction as an artist. Technique is a means to an end. Once command over technique is achieved, the musician tends to devote more time to contemplation. This inner communion leads to manifestation of greater bhava.
Evolving a style…
An artist’s style evolves as the result of years of experience, assimilation and absorption. I work towards an ideal combination of heavy gamakas and ravai sangatis through coordination of right and left movements to realise the maximum potential of the veena as well as sahitya bhava sans unnecessary meetu. This approach has contributed to my handling of ragam, tanam, pallavi and niraval. Singing whatever I learnt before playing it has ensured that my instrumental expression closely shadows the vocal.
Responsibility as an artist…
The celestial timbre (naadam) of the veena strings has filled my waking hours and been my mainstay since childhood. The Saraswathi veena has been revered since ancient times and the vainika aims for closest possible adherence to vocal expression. Every artist carries the responsibility of enhancing the quality of music and the aural experience and garnering greater exposure for quality music. I believe in one putting one’s shoulder to the wheel to produce ennobling music. I leave no stone unturned in this endeavour.
The role of AIR…
As a staff artist, I have received great encouragement from AIR right from the beginning. The awards I won at AIR annual competitions spurred me on to translate my passion into my profession. My participation in South Zone concerts, National Programmes, RTP specials and award-winning musical features such as ‘Ekoham Bhavishyami’ on AIR as well as Doordarshan programmes were enriching experiences. The opportunity of listening up close to AIR concerts of great musicians has been a steady source of inspiration, ideas and insight.
The current scenario with regard to the veena…
Nowadays, few students opt for the veena due to the hard work, late rewards and difficulties involved in portability of the instrument. We need new entrants with the commitment to take it up as a full time profession. While it is heartening to note that some organisations have begun convening veena fests, it would be a fillip to see more vainikas featured in regular concert series. As an artist, I look forward to performing opportunities on a wider platform to create and sustain audience interest.
Performance chart…
In addition to solos, I also give jugalbandhis and have performed with Hindustani musicians such as Purbayan Chatterjee and Janardhan Mitta.
Awards and recognition…
I got the gold medal from the Vishaka Music Academy (1996) and Best Performance award for three consecutive years from Navya Nataka Samithi (1984-86). I have received Sankranthi Puraskar from the Pushpagiri Peetam and to have been honoured as Asthana Vidwan of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam (2008). In 2006, at the request of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams, I tuned devotional songs for the Bhajana Yagna project and conducted the music for 108 songs in an audio release.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/lsquoAn-artist-is-responsible-for-enhancing-music-quality/article16298776.ece
464,Ragas handled with profundity,PVK,2010-05-06,17:09:21 IST,"The composing of thillanas, since the earliest known composer of this musical form Melattur Veerabadriah, has undergone many changes and the last century has seen many vidwans who have made their contributions as composers of thillanas. It would be no exaggeration to state that the art of composing thillanas has reached its zenith with the creations of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Jayaraman's thillanas have gained immense popularity among music lovers, vocal and instrumental performers and have been acclaimed by the traditionalists as well.Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and his sister Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi have presented eight thillanas of their illustrious father in this audio compact disc brought out by Charsur Digital Work Station.The Desh raga thillana is the composer's one of the most popular compositions, probably next to the evergreen Mohanakalyani thillana. The siblings have chosen an appropriate kalapramanam for this opening number and is an apt curtain raiser for the fare which follows.
Clear lyrical content
Great care has been given to the bowing by the violinists while rendering the sahitya portions and the differentiation between the jati syllables and the sahitya are clearly distinguishable. The sahityas do not become an extension of the jatis. The lyrical contents are distinctly clear in the charanam sections.Karnaranjani raga, sporting a tricky Arohanam ‘SRGMGPDS' has a sampoorna Avarohanam ‘SNDPMGRS' (derivative of Kharaharapriya), has been handled with the genius of the composer in the thillana in this raga. It is very sensitively played and does not portray the raga as a mere scale. The melody comes out in full glory and is very engaging.The next number is the adi (tisra nadai) tala set Behag raga thillana which was frequently rendered by M.L. Vasanthakumari in her concerts.Following this are thillanas in Bageshri, Vasanti, Bimplas, Dwijavanti and Madhuvanti. These ragas are very well suited for compositions which serve as tukkadas in a concert. The Vasanti raga thillana is the lengthiest one in this disc and has an eerie opening which suits the melody and warrants a second listening.Perfection has been Lalgudi's hallmark and his offspring live up to this reputation in this disc.The percussionists J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and S. Karthick (ghatam) are seasoned artists and follow the compositions like a shadow. Their playing greatly enhances the listening pleasure.

465,Sketching ragas with ease,G. SWAMINATHAN,2010-05-06,16:48:03 IST,"SWEET VOICES: The Serugudi Sisters.
  The vocal concert of the Serugudi Sisters at Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam was creditable because they included some compositions which are not often heard on concert platforms. A Tamil varnam in Atana provided a zestful start to the proceedings. Tyagaraja's ‘Ninne Bhajana' in Nattai and ‘Graha Balamemi' in Revagupti were pointers to the siblings' interest in projecting the raga images with emphasis on specific sangatis. A few strands of tepid swaras were affixed to the Revagupti kriti.Rema ventured on the elaboration of Rishabhapriya with motifs strong enough to distinguish it from Charukesi. ‘Mahathmule Teliyaleruni' by Mysore Vasudevachar augured well with the dynamism of the kriti adding swara sallies on ‘Mahi Sudha', the anupallavi line. The niraval surfaced only in the Ritigowla kriti of Tyagaraja ‘Chera Ravathe', on ‘Talli Tandri Leni Bala Tana Nathu' with swaras; but here, notwithstanding a melodic raga like Ritigowla, the niraval fell short of emotional aspect.
Well-rehearsed
The core piece was Madhyamavati, which was taken up by Geetha as preface to the Tyagaraja composition ‘Venkatesa Ninnu'. Here the swaras were on the pallavi and moved to the extended kuraippu swara sorties with ‘sadhjam' as the landing note. All swara exchanges in this concert were concluded by both the sisters, with well rehearsed and impressive korvais. On the positive side, the sisters articulate well with full throated expressions. Rationally speaking, they recite well but the missing part is the internalisation of any raga or song which would add charm to the raga, kriti or swara. Well, spontaneity is different from a forced synthetic approach.The fast paced phrases in raga alapana and swara surges can temporarily impress the audience; but it is the evenness in the alapana and how the raga is spread out that will help the performers in the long run. Both Rishabapriya and Madhyamavati were good treatises but offered nothing special or specific to muse or ruminate over later either by the rasika or the singers. This statement holds good for the theoretically correct interpretations of songs sans soul too.With the voices almost identical, sweet and in their control, experience should impart the importance of searching for the spirit and sharing the same with the listener…this is musical wisdom. Hope Rema and Geetha learn this. A few more pleasing kritis were in their kitty; ‘Srihari Vallabhe' in Suddha Dhanyasi by Mysore Vasudevachar, ‘Ranganayakam' in Nayaki by Dikshitar, ‘Manavyala' in Nalinakanti by Tyagaraja and ‘Smarajanaka' in Behag by Swati Thirunal were worth recording.Kovai Chandran more or less presented the raga images in the same style as that of the sisters, offering sound without much soul. Kalakkad R. Srinivasan and Rajaraman on the mridangam and the ghatam provided able support and a tad aggressively framed ‘thani'.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Sketching-ragas-with-ease/article16298754.ece

  Carnatic vocalists Ranjani and Gayatri are among the top artistes on the Carnatic music scene today. As youth icons, they bolster one's confidence in the future of Carnatic music. It was fitting that Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Delhi, honoured them with the title of “Nada Bhushanum” during its annual Tyagaraja festival not long back.Gayatri said the award was a recognition of their hard work and dedicated it to their parents, rasikas and accompanying artistes.Ranjani and Gayatri are known for their melodious and vibrant voices, and their fertile imagination has won them rasikas from across the world.Ranjani takes the lead in sharing her views on the invaluable compositions of the musical Trinity — Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastri. She feels they seem fresh even years after they were composed. “When the audience listens to a kriti, it should make them to sit up and experience the wonder of the raga,” says Ranjani. “As performers we try to bring out the beauty and joy of the raga which is intangible. The listeners should be able relate their feelings with the raga.”Gayatri, bright-eyed, continues: “Without deviation from the traditional system we like to explore new ideas and be innovative in our approach.”Ranjani points out the debt of gratitude she and her sister owe to their parents for their interest in music and tirelessly taking them to concerts when they were young. “It laid a strong foundation. Music is a journey, and we both wish to travel as long as we can.” It was a journey that began with the violin. It was P.S. Narayanaswamy who recommended they give vocal performances, and thus began their metamorphosis from violinists to much sought after vocalists in the Carnatic music world. The duo's effortless singing, especially of vrittams, is a treat for listeners. Their diction and control over raga presentation in the fast tempo speak volumes for their hard work and dedication to maintaining quality. Calling their father a perfectionist, they say they owe their success to him.Gayatri adds, “We have come a long way in vocal performance. What our fingers used to speak, we are expressing vocally. Exposure to Hindustani music has helped us, but music is beyond boundaries. Listening to various forms of music helps a singer, since the good values of music get into your system unconsciously, effortlessly.”Ranjani recollects her teenage years as an accompanist to stalwarts like D.K. Pattamal. They remember her generosity in accepting the child artiste. “The humility and will to make the accompanying artiste comfortable in those days are values we wish to imbibe and cherish,” says Ranjani.Though popular performers, the sisters are cautious of excess. Ranjani says they space out their concert schedule to ensure the health of their vocal chords. “The numbers are not important. We wish to give memorable performances.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Two-to-crescendo/article16299942.ece
467,Tribute to Swati Tirunal,A. Sangameswaran,2010-05-06,16:26:22 IST,"Shreyas Narayanan
  A three-day festival of dance and music dedicated to Swati Tirunal was held at Sree Koodalmanickam temple in Irinjalakkuda.The concert on the first day was by Shreyas Narayanan. He was accompanied by Nellai Ravindran (violin), Melattur Balasubramanian (mridangam) and Thrikkakara Y.N. Santharam (ganjira).A disciple of P.S. Narayanaswamy, Shreyas maintained the purity and perfection of the tradition he belongs to and sang each kriti in a tempo that best suited the piece, thereby enhancing the beauty of the whole recital. The swara passages he sang for the opening piece ‘Devadevakalayamithe’ in Maayamaalavagowla were reminiscent of the Semmangudi bani. The grandeur of Atana was revealed in the kriti ‘Sree Kumara Nagaraalaye’, which was sung at a slow pace.
Fast paced renditions
In contrast came ‘Jaya Jaya Padmanabha’ in Sarasaangi, in Madhyamakaala tempo and the accompanying swara passages. Bhairavai was taken for alapana before the Navarathri kriti ‘Jananimaamava’ and was tagged with niraval and swara passages. A fast paced ‘Bhogeendra sayinam’ in Kunthalavarali set the stage for the main kriti of the evening ‘Raamaraama Guna seema’ in Simhendramadhyamam. Shreyas rendered an erudite alapana, his full throated voice effortlessly scaling through the three octaves.While traversing through the upper octaves, he made sruthibhedam resulting in the raga Bhauli, which was later reproduced by the violinist in his solo essay. The kriti was well rendered with niraval and scintillating manodharma swaras. Nellai Ravindran on the violin and the percussion accompanists contributed to the success of the concert.A sedate ‘Raamachandraprabho’ in Sindhubhairavi, a kriti by Vanamaamalai ‘Janaki Ramana’ in Kaappi and an Abhang ‘Theerthavittala’ in Aaahir bhaiarv constituted the final phase of the concert.On the second day Mathangy Sathyamoorthy accompanied by Vayala Rajendran (violin), B. Jayaram (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreekanth (ganjira) gave a memorable concert. The artiste chose a fine blend of popular and rare kritis so as to please the crowd.The ‘Sarasijanabha’ in Kambhoji was followed by ‘Pahi Sreepathe’ in Hamsadhwani for which she sang an array of swaras. Panthuvaraali was executed in detail and was followed by the kriti ‘Saarasaakshaparipalaya’.
Supple voice
This as well as ‘Kripayapaalaya’ in Charukesi and ‘Maamavasada’ in Kanada was well received by the audience. ‘Bhavaye Padmanabhayiha’, a rarely heard Madhyamaavathi kriti was rendered well. Lalyani was taken for a detailed alapana revealing all its glow and charm before the kriti ‘Paripahimaamayi’, which was the main item for the day. Her supple voice and amazing control over it gave an added colour to the whole concert. ‘Bhajabhajamaanasa’ in Sindhubhairavi and a thillana in Dhanasri concluded the concert.The third day had Moozhikulam Harikrishnan, an up-and-coming singer, rendering ‘Rama Rama pahi’ (Devagandhari), ‘Sree Parvathi’ (Bhauli) and ‘Kalayedevadevam’ (Ranjini) among other kritis. He showed promise during his Kalyani alapana followed by the kriti ‘Sundareeneedivyamu’. He was ably assisted by Aadarsh (violin), the grandson and disciple of Nedumangad Sivanandan and by Krishnachandran (mridangam).
Display of histrionic skills
A Bharathanatyam solo by another promising youngster Aiswarya Raj was the final event of the festival. The dancer displayed her histrionic skills during the Bhairavi pada varnam.‘Shankara Srigiri' in Hamsanandi brought out the skills as a dancer in her as she portrayed the pranks of little mischievous Krishna in ‘Vishamakara Kannan’ of Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer.She wound up the recital with a Kunthalavarali tillana. Arun Gopinath (vocal), R.L.V. Anand (nattuvangam), Raghunath (flute) and Venu Kurumassery (mridangam) were the accompanists. In addition to these there were concerts by devotees and disciples before the main concerts. The fete was organised by Sree Koodalmanickam temple.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Tribute-to-Swati-Tirunal/article16298748.ece
468,Captivating notes,Harish Bal,2010-05-06,16:16:32 IST,"Captivating notes: Amith Nadig
  A flawless gayaki (singing) style is what most flautists strive to achieve. Amith Nadig has accomplished this and much more.Training under veteran R.K. Srikantan, Amith is one of the few youngsters to be awarded an A grade from the All India Radio. The flautist captivated the audience with his mellifluous music in a concert at Kochi recently.He began the concert with a sprightly rendition of the Abhogi varnam ‘Evaribodha' in three speeds. Mysore Vasudevachar's Roopaka tala composition in raga Kamboji, ‘Lambodara' had a neat niraval. Edapally Ajith (violin) followed it up with excellent swara essays Unexpected scale shifts and the ease in playing high octave passages marked the flautist's swaraprasthara. Considering the difficulty in achieving clarity in fast phrases in high octaves, this was a good feat by the young flautist.
Erudite performance
Next came a brisk rendition of ‘Niravadhi sukhada' in raga Ravichandrika. The best alapana was of a subsidiary piece in Kalyani, in which the artiste adeptly caught the true fervour of the raga. The elaboration unravelled the artiste's wide manodharma and flexibility in merging quick, distant phrases together. The kriti chosen was Swati Tirunal's ‘Pankaja lochana' in Misra chappu tala.The korvai swaras came in all blends and delighted the audience. After a peak into Bilahari raga, Amith played ‘Smarasada manasa' in the same raga. A progressive approach to essay raga Keeravani saw the artiste follow the note-by-note approach. He covered all the essential nuances of the raga bringing out the quality of the raga. Tyagaraja's ‘Kalikiyunde gada' was rendered with a brief niraval on ‘Bhagavathagre sarulaku.'K.U. Jayachandra Rao on the mridangam left no loose ends, packing up the gaps fully. He was quick to grasp the rhythmic patterns of the swara phrases and caught up with the mukthaippus correctly. Amith seemed to muse at phrases as he went on improvising on single phrases in subtle myriad ways. The tani with just the mridangam was another flawless exercise.Amit retained the heaviness of the concert in the concluding pieces as well. ‘Govardhana giridhara' in Darbari Kanada and ‘Tamburi meetidava' in Sindhubhairavi. Thus in the few numbers that the flautist played, he could unfold the true Carnatic flavour and essence of the music. The programme was organised by Dharani society.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Captivating-notes/article16298744.ece

473,Anand fails to break the deadlock after the longest game,Ian Rogers,2010-05-07,01:07:26 IST,"Going into the final stages of his World Championship match against Veselin Topalov in Sofia, Bulgaria, World champion Viswanathan Anand took radical measures to try to break the deadlock but after a six and a half hour struggle he could manage only a draw after the longest and most complicated game of the match so far.The match remains tied at 4.5-4.5 with only three games remaining.Anand had his opponent's king trapped on the back rank but with his last move before the time control on move 40 and with just three minutes thinking time left, Anand missed a chance to decide the game.After allowing Topalov's king to escape, it seemed that the World champion's winning chances had evaporated.Now both players began to press for victory, Topalov's queen and running pawns fighting against Anand's active pieces.Anand was gaining the upper hand but he was also running terribly short of time, with 10 moves to complete in only seven minutes to avoid a time forfeit.He reached the move 60 time control and was out of danger of defeat, but the win still required extraordinary technique at a new time limit of 15 minutes plus 30 seconds per move for the remainder of the game. Eventually Anand erred and the game became completely random, with victory possible for either player.Anand had an additional obstacle to overcome on Thursday as, while he was contemplating his 20th move, an electrical fault caused the lighting above the board to flash on and off, and then the main light failed completely.Rather than stop the game timers, as the arbiter had done during the complete blackout in game five, Anand's clock continued ticking as he tried to maintain his concentration and find an effective plan.Fortunately, only three minutes later full-strength lighting returned and Anand almost immediately gave away his queen for two lesser pieces.Anand handled the resulting position with aplomb. However the game of the match continued, with the winner being hot favourite to take the world title. However, the deadlock remained intact.The tenth game will be played on Friday.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/Anand-fails-to-break-the-deadlock-after-the-longest-game/article16298913.ece

476,Jankovic crushes Venus to bury sister showdown,DPA,2010-05-07,14:56:07 IST,"Jelena Jankovic
  Two-time champion Jelena Jankovic bared her claws with a monumental 6-0, 6-1 thrashing of Venus Williams to bury any dream of an all-Williams semifinal at the Internazionale d’Italia.Top-seed Serena Williams had earlier won her 10th match in a row to do her part to set up a possible sister clash, earning a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Russian Maria Kirilenko.But elder sister Venus was humbled in 59 minutes by Serb Jankovic.The loss was the most comprehensive in Williams’ career — 16 years as a professional — with the US player unable to make any effort in the face of the Jankovic tsunami on clay in humid and chilly night-time conditions.“I had so many tough matches against Venus,” said Jankovic, now 6- 5 in the series. “It’s great to win. This scoreline is unbelievable.When you play against a Williams you can’t relax. You have to go out there and give it your best.” Former French Open champion and number one Ana Ivanovic may be finally turning the corner on a long and frustrating slump measured in months rather than weeks.The Serb upset 14th-seed Nadia Petrova of Russia 6-2, 7-5 for only her third top-10 win since November 2008. Number 59 Ivanovic has also beaten ninth seed Victoria Azarenka and Russian Elena Dementieva this week.“I’ve been feeling really good on court for a couple of weeks now, and I really felt it could happen any week,” said Ivanovic. “I just needed to get some more momentum and start playing matches. That’s what I’ve been lacking for so long. To have these wins here means a lot.”Spain’s Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez put out Czech Lucie Safarova 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 in an unseeded match-up at the Foro Italico interrupted briefly by a rainstorm.Martinez Sanchez avoided a letdown after knocking out Danish second seed Caroline Wozniacki on Thursday on the Roman clay.Serena Williams is playing her first event since winning the Australian Open three months ago, blaming a left knee injury for keeping her off court.Williams sent down seven aces and broke serve four times in a 78-minute contest against the first-time quarterfinalist in Rome.Williams has beaten Kirilenko in all three of their matches, last in 2006.But the winner can’t understand how she’s done so well after her long pause: “I can’t believe I’m still in the tournament. It’s weird.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/Jankovic-crushes-Venus-to-bury-sister-showdown/article16299031.ece
477,The technology helper: Mobile apps for your smartphone,DPA,2010-05-07,19:20:16 IST,"A BlackBerry Storm smartphone displayed at Best Buy in Mountain View, California.
  As more people are performing computing chores on their mobile phones, the search for useful apps is on.E-mail is usually covered adequately by smartphones, but how about instant messaging, forum reading, better web browsing, and tweeting? No problem. Read on for some suggestions.
Q: I’m addicted to instant messaging on the computer, but my iPhone doesn’t seem to have the ability to tie in to my Yahoo instant message account. Is there a cell phone app that will work?A: If you use only Yahoo!, you can certainly do worse that downloading and installing Yahoo! for mobile. Just navigate to >http://mobile.yahoo.com and type in your phone number. Yahoo will message you a direct link to the application’s download site. Or you can type m.yahoo.com into your phone’s browser, and you’ll get the same thing. The Yahoo! app will give you access to the IM client as well as plenty of other Yahoo! services, including e-mail.If you need access to more than one instant messenger from your smartphone, though, try Beejive (
>http://www.beejive.com). This nifty little application can aggregate your IM account from multiple services, including Yahoo!, AIM, Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger, and more. Also available for BlackBerry, Beejive sports a very intuitive and easy-to-read interface, and with it, you’ll be able to keep track of multiple conversations from multiple services at once.
Q: I use my BlackBerry for everything except web browsing because the browser is so slow and hard to read. Is there a better browsing application I can use?A: The web browser in the BlackBerry phone is indeed lacking. But there are options. Your first stop should be to >http://m.opera.com on your BlackBerry browser. There, you’ll find Opera Mini, a free browser that does everything that the BlackBerry browser doesn’t.It’s fast, first of all.

479,Downturn has slowed down child labour elimination: ILO,Aarti Dhar,2010-05-07,23:57:20 IST,"Amid growing concerns over the impact of the economic downturn, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has warned that efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labour have slowed down and called for a “re-energised” global campaign to end the practice.In its global report on child labour, the ILO said the global number of child labourers had declined from 222 million to 215 million, or 3 per cent, over the period 2004 to 2008, representing a “slowing down of the global pace of reduction.”It expressed concern over the possibility that the global economic crisis could “further brake” progress towards the goal of eliminating the worst forms of child labour by 2016.The report, ‘Accelerating action against Child Labour,' says the updated picture from 2006 onwards is one of “uneven” progress towards the goal of eliminating the worst forms of child labour by 2016. The report warned that if current trends continued the 2016 target would be missed.The good news is that the overall pattern of child labour reduction has been maintained: the more harmful the work and the more vulnerable the children involved, the faster the decline. However, a staggering 115 million are still exposed to hazardous work, a proxy often used for the worst forms of child labour.The report breaks down data by age and gender. Progress was greatest among children aged 5-14, where the number of child labourers fell by 10 per cent. The number of children in hazardous work in this age range fell by 31 per cent. Child labour among girls decreased considerably (by 15 million or 15 per cent). However, it increased among boys (by 8 million or 7 per cent). What's more, child labour among young people aged 15 to 17 increased by 20 per cent, from 52 million to 62 million.The report includes data aggregated by region. It shows, for example, that the Asia Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean continue to reduce child labour, while sub-Saharan Africa has witnessed an increase both in relative and absolute terms. This region also has the highest incidence of children working, with one in four children engaged in child labour.Among children aged 5 to 14 in employment, the Asia and the Pacific region experienced a considerable decrease, not only in absolute numbers but also in relative terms (a decline of 26 million from 122.3 million to 96.4 million and a 4 percentage point decrease in incidence). For the same age category, the number of children in employment also continued to decline in Latin America and the Caribbean, albeit at a slower rate. However, the number of children in employment was increasing in sub-Saharan Africa in relative as well as absolute terms in the age group of 5-14.While most child labour was concentrated in South Asia because of its large population, other ‘pockets' of child labour — often the hardest to reach “hidden” forms — could be found in most countries across the region. Therefore the critical fight against child labour had to be won in South Asia, where the greatest numbers of child labourers were to be found. Often it was the ‘poverty of policy' rather than poverty itself that kept the mass of children out of school and in child labour.More than 48 million children in Asia-Pacific were in hazardous work – in other words, 42 per cent of all the children engaged in child labour in this region were involved in such work. They accounted for 40 per cent of the world's total number of children in hazardous work.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Downturn-has-slowed-down-child-labour-elimination-ILO/article16299135.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao said: “The situation in Manipur is very serious and highly alarming. The law-and-order situation is deteriorating day by day, constitutional machinery has broken down and fundamental rights of the common man were violated under the Okram Ibobi Singh-led government. The Centre should immediately dismiss the State government.The BJP leader, however, backed the decision of the State government of not allowing the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah to visit his native village Somdal in Uhrul district of Manipur. “There was no problem in Mr. Muivah's visit. But his agenda of bifurcating Manipur is not acceptable to the people of Manipur and the BJP also,” he said.

481,“Governors owe their allegiance to Constitution”,Legal Correspondent,2010-05-07,23:51:43 IST,"A Governor is not an agent or employee of the Union government who can be arbitrarily removed by the Centre during change of party in power, the Supreme Court held on Friday.A Constitution Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said: “the doctrine of pleasure [under Article 156 of the Constitution] is not a licence to act with unfettered discretion to act arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously. It does not dispense with the need for a cause for withdrawal of the pleasure. The withdrawal of pleasure cannot be at the sweet will, whim and fancy of the Authority, but can only be for valid reasons.”The Bench was disposing of a writ petition filed as a public interest litigation in the wake of the removal of the Governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa on July 2, 2004 by the then President of India on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.The Bench said:“In the early days of Indian democracy, the same political party was in power both at the Centre and the States. The position has changed with passage of time. Now different political parties, some national and some regional, are in power in the States. Further one single party may not be in power either in the Centre or in the State. Different parties with distinct ideologies may constitute a front, to form a government.“On account of emergence of coalition politics, many regional parties have started sharing power in the Centre. Many a time there may not even be a common programme, manifesto or agenda among the parties sharing power. As a result, the agenda or ideology of a political party in power in the State may not be in sync with the agenda or ideology of the political parties in the ruling coalition at the Centre, or may not be in sync with the agenda or ideology of some of the political parties in the ruling coalition at the Centre, but may be in sync with some other political parties forming part of the ruling coalition at the Centre.“Further, the compulsions of coalition politics may require the parties sharing power to frequently change their policies and agendas. In such a scenario of myriad policies, ideologies, agendas in the shifting sands of political coalitions, there is no question of the Union government having Governors who are in sync with its mandate and policies. Governors are not expected or required to implement the policies of the government or popular mandates. Their constitutional role is clearly defined and bears very limited political overtones.“Reputed elder statesmen, able administrators and eminent personalities, with maturity and experience are expected to be appointed as Governors. While some of them may come from a political background, once they are appointed as Governors, they owe their allegiance and loyalty to the Constitution and not to any political party and are required to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.“We, therefore, reject the contention of the respondents that Governors should be in “sync” with the policies of the Union government or should subscribe to the ideology of the party in power at the Centre. As the Governor is neither the employee nor the agent of the Union government, we also reject the contention that a Governor can be removed if the Union government or party in power loses ‘confidence' in him.”The Bench noted that persons of calibre, experience, and distinction “are chosen to fill these posts. Such persons are chosen not to enable them to earn their livelihood but to serve society. It is wrong to assume that such persons having been chosen on account of their stature, maturity and experience will be demoralised or be in constant fear of removal, unless there is security of tenure. The doctrine of pleasure is not a licence to act with unfettered discretion to act arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/ldquoGovernors-owe-their-allegiance-to-Constitutionrdquo/article16299132.ece
482,"Governors can't be removed at Centre's whims, says Court",J. Venkatesan,2010-05-07,23:29:08 IST,"A view of the Supreme Court.
  | Photo Credit: The Hindu The Supreme Court on Friday held that a Governor cannot be removed on the ground that he/she is out of sync with the policies and ideologies of the Union government or the party in power at the Centre. Nor can he/she be removed on the ground that the Union government has lost confidence in him/her.A five-judge Constitution Bench, comprising Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justices S.H. Kapadia, R.V. Raveendran, B. Sudershan Reddy and P. Sathasivam was disposing of a petition filed by the former Member of Parliament, B.P. Singhal.The Bench said that as a Governor was neither an employee nor agent of the Union government, it was rejecting the contention that a Governor could be removed if the Union government or the party in power lost ‘confidence' in him.It held that a change in government at the Centre was not a ground for removal of Governors to make way for others favoured by the new government.Writing the judgment, Justice Raveendran said, “What Article 156 (1) of the Constitution [under which a Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President] dispenses with is the need to assign reasons or the need to give notice, but the need to act fairly and reasonably cannot be dispensed with by Article 156(1).”The Bench said:“The President, in exercising power under Article 156(1), should act in a manner that is not arbitrary or unreasonable. In the event of challenge of withdrawal of the pleasure, the court will necessarily assume that it is for compelling reasons. Consequently, where the aggrieved person is not able to establish a prima facie instance of arbitrariness or mala fides in his removal, the court will refuse to interfere.“However, where a prima facie case of arbitrariness or mala fides is made out, the court can require the Union government to produce records/material to satisfy itself that the withdrawal of pleasure was for good and compelling reasons. What constitutes good and compelling reasons would depend upon the facts of the case. Having regard to the nature of functions of the Governor in maintaining Centre-State relations, and the flexibility available to the government in such matters, it is needless to say that there will be no interference unless a very strong case is made out.”The court said if the aggrieved person was able to demonstrate prima facie that his or her removal was arbitrary, mala fide, capricious or whimsical, it would call upon the Union government to disclose to it the material upon which the President took the decision to withdraw the pleasure. If the government did not disclose any reason, or if the reasons disclosed were found to be irrelevant, arbitrary, whimsical, or mala fide, it would interfere in such a decision.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Governors-cant-be-removed-at-Centres-whims-says-Court/article16299196.ece

486,Law introduced in US to revoke citizenship of terror suspects,PTI,2010-05-07,09:39:10 IST,"Concerned over terror groups recruiting expatriates in the U.S. to launch attacks against the country, a group of lawmakers today introduced a legislation in the Congress that would allow the government to revoke the citizenship of people who attack the U.S. or its allies.The bipartisan legislation - Terrorism Expatriation Act - would also allow the State Department to revoke the citizenship of people who provide support to terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda.“Under the terrorist expatriation act, the State Department would be able to revoke the citizenship of an American who affiliates with a foreign terrorist organisation or who fights against our country,” Senator Joe Lieberman told a press conference at the Capitol Hill on Friday.Foreign terrorist organisations are also designated according to statute by the U.S. State Department.The legislation is being introduced in the context of the arrest of Faisal Shahzad, Pakistani-American, who has been charged of terrorist activities and plotting to explode a bomb at the Times Square last Saturday.Identical bills were introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.However, Lieberman said the legislation, when finally becomes a law, could not be applicable to Shahzad.“This proposal if adopted cannot apply to Faisal Shahzad because that would be the retroactive application of a law, which would not be appropriate or constitutional,” he said.Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee Lieberman said Shahzad is just the latest in a growing and accelerating line of cases where American citizens have supported or fought for al-Qaeda or affiliated terrorist organisations against the United States.“The facts are now clear. Over the past several years, the threat from Islamist terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda has changed. On 9/11, 19 terrorist who were trained abroad were sent here to carry out their attacks on America.Now, with increasing frequency, American citizens like Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood - the alleged Fort Hood killer of 13, Abdulhakim Mohammad, who killed a U.S. Army recruiter in Little Rock last June, and Faisal Shahzad, the accused Times Square terrorist, are inspired or recruited by violent,” he noted.Once the law is passed, if an American citizen travelled to Somalia to train and fight for the terrorist group al-Shabab, the State Department will have the authority to begin proceedings to revoke their citizenship so that they cannot return here on their passports to carry out an attack against Americans, Liberman said.“If in some way they do and are then captured, they will not enjoy the rights and privileges of American citizenship in the legal proceedings against them. That, I think, will make America safer,” Lieberman said.“The law would also make it easier to pursue and prosecute individuals like Adam Gadahn, the aforementioned al Qaeda-American spokesman, by military commission. Gadahn famously destroyed his US passport in a jihadist recruiting video in what was obviously an indication that he wanted to renounce his citizenship.This bill only updates an existing statute that has been on the books for 70 years to account for the terrorist enemy that the U.S. is fighting today.Senator Scott Brown said al Qaeda and foreign terrorist organizations have a long-standing strategy to recruit U.S. citizens, and to train them in a foreign country, and then send them back to try to kill Americans and anyone visiting our country.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Law-introduced-in-US-to-revoke-citizenship-of-terror-suspects/article16299005.ece

  Bharatiya Janata Party president Nitin Gadkari on Thursday declined to say if the party will press for a change in Jharkhand chief ministership. “I would say, wait and watch,” he said.At a press conference here, he said, “I will be going to Jharkhand tomorrow [Friday] and will meet all those related to the issue.”The BJP would take all steps to ensure that the Congress did not benefit from the impasse in the State. “We will ensure that the Congress does not benefit from the Jharkhand situation by breaking smaller parties with money and muscle power,” he said.Jharkhand plunged into a political crisis after Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Shibu Soren voted in favour of the United Progressive Alliance government on a cut motion moved by the BJP in the Lok Sabha on April 27. A day after the cut motion, the BJP's parliamentary board decided to withdraw the party's support to the Soren-led government, only to later put its decision on hold and instead ask Mr. Soren to quit and mobilise the JMM's support in favour of the BJP.
Nationwide agitation
Mr. Gadkari said the BJP would launch a nationwide agitation on May 12 against “the misuse of the CBI by the United Progressive alliance (UPA) government to blackmail and threaten Opposition leaders.”“BJP workers will protest outside the CBI offices in all State capitals against the large-scale misuse. We demand this misuse be stopped immediately. We will also raise this issue in the Parliament,” he said.He, however, declined to comment when asked to respond to the action taken against media portal Tehelka.com when the National Democratic Alliance was in power. “I cannot say anything about that now. But all I can say is there was no misuse of the CBI during the NDA regime,” he said.He also accused the CBI of specifically harassing the Gujarat government and its police officers over the issue of fake shoot-outs.The CBI was also used to pressure vulnerable Opposition leaders, particularly those belonging to the BJP, SP and the RJD and harassing those Opposition leaders who were not vulnerable to government pressure, he alleged.He said he had worked out a strategy to enhance the party's vote bank by 10 per cent till the next Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by reaching out to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, minorities and unorganised labour in a big way. The party would set up a “think tank” to work on the strategy.Mr. Gadkari is on a two-day visit to Goa.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Will-not-allow-Congress-to-benefit-in-Jharkhand-Gadkari/article16299079.ece

However, the incident did not affect Faesal's resolve to achieve his goal.People from all walks of life visited Faesal's home to congratulate his family for a feat that has “made every Kashmiri proud.”In Sogam, people celebrated by bursting crackers.
“Remarkable feat”
Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said it was a remarkable achievement. “Wherever Kashmiris have worked, they have excelled. I am proud of Faesal, who hails from a remote village. He has worked so hard and made us real proud,” he told The Hindu, adding that Kashmiri talent was unmatched.The former Chief Minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and People's Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti congratulated Faesal.In a joint statement issued here on Thursday, the PDP leaders also said that the youth from the remotest Lolab area of the Kupwara district proved his capability by securing the first position in the country. They said Faesal's achievement also proved the intellectual potential of the youth of Jammu and Kashmir and that his success would give inspiration to youth of the State.Youth National Conference president Qaisar Jamsheed Lone and MLA Lolab Abdul Haque Khan were among others who congratulated Faesal.
After a 16-year gap
The last Kashmiri to have qualified for the IAS was Asghar Hassan Samoon. Faesal has entered the elite services after a gap of 16 years. Two more Kashmiris qualified for the Civil Services this year, while one entered the IPS last year.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/I-did-not-put-any-restrictions-and-whatever-he-wanted-to-do-he-went-ahead-and-did-it-mother/article16298882.ece
493,Hunger for humour,Rana Siddiqui Zaman,2010-05-07,20:23:07 IST,"Rakesh Bedi
  If they said laughter is the closest distance between two people, they certainly had people like Rakesh Bedi in mind. If his very name brings a smile to one's face, a chat with him fills you with laughter. Just like in reel life through various films and television serials where he had us in splits, he lives up to his roles in real life too.So, this graduate of Bhagat Singh College, Delhi University, begins with why he just couldn't become the engineer his technocrat father posted at the Australian Embassy wanted him to be.“On my father's insistence, I went to take the entrance test of IIT-Delhi. The test paper contained 13 questions with three parts each. I knew only one answer. The paper started at 9 a.m. I wrote that one answer and submitted the paper at 9.05 a.m. The examiner got the shock of his life. Wide-eyed, he asked, ‘Are you sure you have done the answers?' I replied, ‘Actually, I have come to the wrong address,' and left the exam hall!”Next, the actor tried Biology. “But the cockroaches on the table to be dissected sent shivers down my spine. I ran away from there too,” he recalls.During his school days at DPS Mathura Road, Delhi, and Kendriya Vidyalaya, Bedi was active in theatre. In 1972-73 he formed his own theatre group, called Ankur Arts, in Delhi. He reminisces, “Those were the days. With little money in hand, we used to produce, direct, write and market our own plays. Khud hi ja kar poster chipkate the aur theatre book karte the.”His love for acting made Bedi join the Film and Television Institute of India, , Pune. “My father wasn't angry as he knew this was the only thing I could do. Moreover, we were also an artistically-inclined family, as my maternal grandfather used to act in films and his co-stars used to be those days' big actors, like Ram Kumar and Chaman Lal. Since I inherited acting, there was not much bother in the family about my choice of career,” he says.Lessons in acting from an established institute, Bedi says, help you reach your goal faster. “If you know the technicality, you reach your goal faster, otherwise you beat around the bush. You set your own parameters any way.”After the course, Bedi knew exactly what he wanted to do — comedy. And in his debut in Saeed Mirza's film Diploma, he played the lead role of a comedian.“That was it. Those who saw it insisted that I must do comedy only. And I also think that if I tell you a joke and you laugh at it instantly, my job is done. I don't believe in the bifurcation of humour into white or black comedy. I think those who cannot make others laugh say it had black humour, or those who don't understand comedy say it was black humour. Plays like Tajmahal ka Tender and Massage, of which I have done over 100 shows, certainly have black humour, because they expose the system, but while I acted in them my sole aim remained to make you laugh instantly. Then you go home and think whether it was black or white or slapstick humour. You see Charlie Chaplin films. They have pathos but they primarily make you laugh, and that's why they are successful too”.The film Diploma brought him the famous serial Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi on Doordarshan. It also opened more doors in the film world, where he again preferred comic roles.“It's not that I didn't get serious roles or I couldn't do them. My bent of mind is such. By nature I am naughty. Main thoda shararti hoon and that's why even if I get into a tense situation, I prefer to wriggle out of it soon, even at the cost of belittling myself. For instance, if I have hurt someone and the situation has become tense, I prefer saying sorry even if it hurts my ego. That way, I know that at least I will be relaxed,” Bedi avers.With this easygoing temperament, Bedi has made great friends in stalwarts like Rajkumar, Sanjeev Kumar and Dharmendra. He recalls, “I have done some five films with Rajkumar and shared a great rapport with him. While working on the sets of Bulandi, I heard that my mother had passed away and I had to rush to Delhi for her last rites. The next day the producer was standing at my doorstep; he had come to take me back. With a heavy heart when I reached the sets, Rajkumar held my hand and took me for a long walk. He told me, ‘Once even I had to come for work when my brother died. If you hadn't come, the producer would suffermajor financial loss. We have to be professional actors and I am not responsible for calling you back.” With these words he put me in the right frame of mind.”Bedi has consciously stayed away from daily soap operas on TV. He says, “I am the only actor who has been regular on television without daily soaps for over 27 years. I can't work in serials where I have to stand in a corner for ages and execute only one emotion,” he laughs.But doing comedy in Hindi films hasn't made him happy either. “If there are lesser comedians or fewer comedy roles, actors can't be blamed. It is the fault of filmmakers.” He feels comedy gets pushed to the background during scriptwriting. “Comedy is only added later to bring some laughs. It always gets step-brotherly treatment in films.”That's why Bedi, a father of two children aged 23 and 19, has been active in theatre for several years. Few know that he is a poet too. And the poet in him sees the serious side of life. Sample this:
Tadbeer se zamane ki taqdeer ko badloon

Gar tera sath ho to tasveer ko badloon

Badal gaya zamana yar ab tu bhi to badal
Ya phir panditon or peer ko badloon?

  My workout regimen is a combination of gym and yoga. I go to the gym four times a week. I have reduced my cardio, and I do more of strength training.So my workout includes a lot of spinning and stretching. The reason why I do less of cardio and more of strength training is because of lack of time. I also like doing yoga and I practise it once a week.I do not follow a particular diet as such, though I definitely watch what I eat, because more than dieting it is important to eat healthy. Fortunately, I am not a foodie so I don't get tempted very often. I try not to eat fried and heavy food like paranthas and sweets very often.Other than working out, it is very important to have a healthy lifestyle. One must have a balanced routine. Sleep on time and wake up on time and make sure you get adequate rest.For girls, one should avoid using too much make-up, as it spoils the skin. Even if you do, make sure you take it off before you go to bed.And use as much natural stuff as possible, like cucumbers and tomatoes.

  | Photo Credit: Rajeev Bhatt If you want to catch hold of NIFT students on a break, you have one hour to do so, between noon and 1 p.m., Monday to Friday. There's not much time before classes resume, so chances are, all of them will be on campus or, at the most, across the road, over at Subhash's stall.The NIFT campus at Hauz Khas is a pretty one — cool corridors, brightly-painted canteen and amphitheatre (or ‘kund' as the students call it). The ‘kund' is obviously empty, the sun infusing it with the torturous blaze of a Roman coliseum at daytime. In the foyer, some students are putting finishing touches to projects they have to submit for ‘jury' appraisal. The amphitheatre isn't usually that sparse, we are informed, with cricket matches and ‘kavi sammelans' keeping it occupied on some evenings. That's also where the students have their fashion shows.
What's not to be
The one-hour break, which also means classes are taken seriously. “Since the break is short, even if students leave the campus, you'll find them on the other side of the road,” says Radhika with friends Palki and Aditi, while a colourful hand-painted umbrella does the rounds.
Alternatives
There's another unlikely place that comes up frequently during conversations with students. “Washrooms!” grins Neeji Bansal, a first year student of leather designing, out for lunch at the canteen with friends. “We sometimes also get breaks in-between classes,” says someone from the group. “Depends on the teacher,” drawls one more. The canteen, with its menu of dal-chawal and select Chinese, remains packed, with fried-rice Manchurian ranking higher than the rest. There's a Nescafe outlet too not far away.Close by, a bunch of hassled-looking second-year Fashion Communication students — Ishani, Harleen and Richa — are hanging out in the foyer. “We eat and we sleep,” they say about their break-time activity. “We talk in the library too,” they say about other ways of catching up.Students get together outside campus too. There's a Café Coffee Day outlet nearby and a Nirula's not too far off.“We also hang out at Select CityWalk because we usually have assignments in malls,” say some.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Swift-breaks-in-NIFT/article16299101.ece

What you need
King prawns (de-veined and cleaned): 250 gm
To marinate:
Yogurt: two tbspGinger paste: one tbspGarlic paste: one tbspLime juice: one tbspKashmiri chilli powder: one tspCumin powder: half tspCoriander powder: one tspTandoori masala: one tbsp (If you have this, omit coriander and cumin powder)Salt if requiredWooden skewers (soaked in water): 6 to 8Oil: enough to grease the griddle pan/ grillFresh lime: one wedge
Cooking instructions
Mix all the ingredients together and marinate the prawns. Keep aside for 10 minutes (if you have time, otherwise you can skip to the next step).Thread on the skewers (about six on each), oil the pan and once it is hot, place the prawn skewers in batches (if required) on to the grill. If you are using an electric grill, it cooks much faster, but be careful not to burn them. If you are doing it in a frying pan over fire, cook each side for three to four minutes. If it is on a barbecue grill, it could take a little longer, but you need to remember that prawns when over cooked, turn hard. It should retain its nice juicy texture. Squeeze some lime on top and serve hot along with some mint-coriander yogurt chutney.
On a day you crave for something spicy and something in a jiffy, these tandoori flavoured prawns come to your rescue. It's made its way through many a barbecue sessions at home and my mom, Jaga, even though not a huge fan of seafood, makes this excellent tandoori prawns in under 15 minutes.

497,And the winner is…,SHONALI MUTHALALY,2010-05-07,17:31:28 IST,"Noma, this year's title holder for ‘Best restaurant in the world', is set in an old Copenhagen warehouse. Its chef, Rene Redzepi, is just 32 years old. Its food is Nordic/Scandinavian, proudly created with local ingredients.As the San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants list, unveiled on April 26 in London, shows, when it comes to the world dining stage, there's nothing quite as delightful as defiance. Creative, determined, driven defiance. That's what creates menus such as Noma's: baby carrots served on an edible “soil” of malt, hazelnuts and beer. Featuring raw materials such as horse mussels, unripe elderberries and seaweed, all foraged from the region. A menu so dependent on sourcing the best produce possible, it even insists on curd from Iceland.Today's well-travelled, and admittedly spoilt, diners desire the unusual. At the same time, in these days of instability — whether we're talking politics, environment or finance — people crave connections to the past, the earth and tradition. The chefs who reach the top are the ones who manage to pull this all off.Competition is fierce. Fortunately, there's no dearth of talent.This list of the world's best restaurants, which generates reams of conversation and controversy every year, is published in conjunction with trade magazine, Restaurant to track dining trends. Drawn up by a jury of 800 of the world's most celebrated chefs, food writers and opinion makers, this year's list introduces a wave of young rock star chefs. All unapologetically breaking traditional rules of gastronomy. This includes Iñaki Aizpitarte, changing French fine dining with his Parisian bistro, Le Chateaubriand, which has risen to number 11, complete with its chalk boards and hard wooden chairs. Biko, in Mexico, is hip in a completely different way with its club atmosphere and signature foie 100 per cent candy, foie gras topped by a cloud of cotton candy and sherry vinegar.In an e-mail interview with MetroPlus, Nathan Garnett, director of the San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants list, explains why this exercise expresses global dining trends so comprehensively. “This highlights who is doing something important, culinary hotspots, restaurant designs that have captured the imagination and so on. For chefs it's a great opportunity to express respect or admiration for fellow chefs...”He adds that since food is subjective, the process of putting this list together is a lot of “fun”. “It creates a huge debate each year and that is precisely why we do it, to get people talking about what does make a great restaurant… A beach cafe on Bondi beach, or an Indian restaurant on the streets of Birmingham in the U.K. can all garner a vote if someone feels compelled enough to do so.”Stating that he's managed to try only a few of the restaurants on the list so far (“although I am working on that!”) Garnett says he likes all types of restaurant experiences. “I recently dined at the Fat Duck and it was incredible — I loved the story telling behind each dish and the fact that they transport you away to another time or place. Equally, I have dined at Momofuku Ssam Bar in the last 12 months and enjoyed the no-nonsense fun, experimentation, and local produce.”Asia is gradually making an impact on the list. Garnett says they have a significant proportion of the Academy based in Asia, voting and judging the region's restaurants. Iggys in Singapore, the first Asian restaurant to break in, has climbed to number 28. Jaan par Andre from Singapore, is at Number 39.It's about more than just great food. A great restaurant is about the whole experience. “The definition of a great restaurant will vary from person to person,” says Garnett, “I believe the ultimate test is the memories you are left with.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/And-the-winner-is%E2%80%A6/article11638807.ece
498,Courting life,DIVYA KUMAR,2010-05-07,17:27:39 IST,"SERVE TO WIN Ramesh Krishnan. Photo: R. Ragu
  Ramesh Krishnan doesn't remember a time when he didn't play tennis. Literally.“I've been around tennis courts with a racquet in hand for as long as I can remember,” he laughs. “There was a clay court in our garden, where my father learnt to play, and I'm sure I came out there as a toddler and hit some balls!”It came from being part of a large tennis-loving family, he says, where there was almost always a tennis game on, and never a dearth of players.“My grandfather T.K. Ramanathan was very keen on tennis and he made sure we all played,” Ramesh recalls. “Even back in the Sixties, the ladies in our family — my aunt and my mother — used to play, and there was always someone to play with. Our whole lives revolved around a tennis court.”Of course, it went without saying that the toddler who played in the backyard would eventually follow in the footsteps of his father, tennis legend Ramanathan Krishnan.“It was my grandfather's dream, and I never really gave any other career a thought,” he says simply. “By the time I was in high school, I was representing India in the Davis Cup, so my education was geared towards that. I don't know what I would have ventured into if not tennis!”And follow he did, chalking up a stellar career in juniors just like his father — he was ranked No. 1 in the world and won both the junior Wimbledon and French Open titles — and then building a solid career on the main tour (he was ranked as high as No. 23 in the world), featuring in some memorable matches at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and, of course, in the Davis Cup.“The Davis Cup matches always stand out — we reached the final in 1987 and the semi-final in 1993. And, reaching the quarter-finals at the U.S. Open [1981 and 1987] and Wimbledon [1986] is something I look back fondly on,” he says. “Both the Davis Cup and Wimbledon always meant a little extra to me.”In a career spanning three decades (1977 to 1993), he won a reputation not only for having a beautiful game, all amazing angles and volleys, but also for being a gentleman on and off the court.“The bulk of players from India were well behaved — I think our society demands that,” he says, unassumingly. “You were expected to carry yourself a certain way in public.”When it came time to retire in 1993, Ramesh was quite content to hang up his racquet , professionally speaking. It gave him more time to focus on that other core passion of his life — family.“My children had started school and they couldn't travel with me as much,” he says. “Suddenly I wasn't that excited anymore about boarding a plane and travelling leaving my family behind.”Fittingly, his family remains tennis-crazy, with both his daughters, Gayatri and Nandita, playing tennis, first in juniors' tournaments, and now for their respective universities in the U.S.Travelling with his daughters to juniors' tournaments as his parents did with him decades ago, Ramesh had come full circle — and discovered it wasn't easy. “There were times when Gayatri was playing and I knew her opponent was not being fair to her, but I had to detach myself — it's a whole new experience as a parent,” he says ruefully. “It's like being on the rollercoaster all over again… but, this time, I had no control over what was happening!”Today, sitting in the garden that once housed the clay court he played on, Ramesh exudes calm contentment. His days are spent caring for the Krishnan Tennis Centre (“a place to come play tennis and get some exercise”), the Indane Gas supply service his father started in 1963 (“he played in the amateur era and needed a livelihood”) and his daughters (“helping them achieve what they want to.”)He still plays tennis socially almost every day of the week, but says his role in the future of Indian tennis is just that of ‘cheerleader' — “I'm happy to root for people who're doing well,” he smiles.Tennis has been his life and his education, and that, for Ramesh, is enough: “It gave me a chance to grow as a person. I've had all these amazing experiences, and I have tennis to thank for it,” he says.
SERVE AND VOLLEY

Pitted against the best: I consider Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras the most outstanding players I ever faced – Borg in the early part of my career in the 70s, and Sampras towards the end of my career in the 90s, just as he was starting out.
Toughest opponent: I always found Ivan Lendl very tough to play. His style of play just didn't suit me – I couldn't serve big enough to unsettle him and he was a bit too overpowering. He was a nightmare for many players to face, and I was one of them!

  | Photo Credit: PAUL SAKUMA After hitting the gym, doing yoga and jogging, people are now trying blood group-based diets, popular in the West. Experts say the secret to a fit body may be hidden in the blood type, and these diets are finding a foothold in India.Explaining how such diets work, Ekta Tandon, dietician at dailydiet.in, says a chemical reaction occurs between your blood and foods as they are digested.“Lectins, a diverse and abundant protein found in food, may be incompatible with your blood group. I recommend that one follow a blood group diet along with regular food to provide the body with all nutrients,” she adds. American naturopaths James D'Adamo and his son Peter D'Adamo, founder of blood group-based diets, feel each person's blood group is the key to how he/she burns calories. Also, it decides what food they should eat and how they benefit from a certain type of exercise.“People with A blood type have a different set of characteristics from people who are Type O — they are susceptible to different diseases, should eat different foods and exercise differently,” says Peter on their website www.dadamo.com.The blood group diet chart suggests that ‘Type O' people should eat high proteins; ‘Type A' should avoid heavy proteins and dig on carbohydrates; ‘Type B' people should drink more milk and avoid fruits such as corns, lentils and peanuts.People with the rare Type AB blood group can go for a combination of the diet recommended for Type A and Type B.“In the three months that I have been on a diet, I have lost almost five kg. So far, everything is good,” says Akankasha Darswal, who is a Type A.“The only difficulty was eating more carbohydrates. I was a bit sceptical, because we all believe that we should avoid carbohydrates to lose weight, but the results are there to see,” she adds.However, Tandon says that one should not overdo this diet. Also, it is important to consult a professional and factor in your age into the programme.”Food and exercise go hand in hand — eat well and exercise well to stay fit. But, the diet has its critics. “I don't recommend that my clients go on such a diet, and have never seen a particular diet showing the same results on those with the of the same blood group,” says Sonia Narang, a senior dietician.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/A-new-way-to-fitness/article16299056.ece
502,Getting his ‘act’ together,Prabalika M. Borah,2010-05-07,16:58:38 IST,"Rammohan Holagundi of Nishumbita Ballet & Theatre Group.Photo: Nagara Gopal
  | Photo Credit: NAGARA GOPAL ‘All the world's a stage' said Shakespeare… “I would love to carry the world with me,” is how Rammohan Holagundi, theatre personality, would end it. From a struggling start in streets, to forming Nishumbita, a theatre group with more than 100 registered members, Ram has come a long way.Years back when he was scripting the ‘acts of life' beating the dappu to spread awareness on family planning with his small group, he didn't realise the potential of theatre. “As a tool for spreading the message among people, it is a very powerful medium,” he says.Since childhood it has been Ram's dream to do something for the society and when he became a student of theatre, he realised that the tool to fight the ills of society was finally in his hands. It's been 21 years since then, now Ram uses theatre to help children find their creative instincts. His recent production was a play based on folk tales from different parts of the country and he is also preparing his little actors for the theatre fest to be held in Kolkata.“In a class of 60, around 40 children want to take up theatre, this goes to reflect the interest levels among children,” says Ram who teaches acting as a subject in different schools in the city. While kids look interested, the real task for Ram lies in encouraging the parents to let their children join theatre classes. “Parents somehow feel other subjects like computers science will make their child's future. Then I have to cite examples of software professionals and bureaucrats who do theatre despite being what they are,” shrugs Ram.Unlike most actors or directors, theatre wasn't something that Ram chanced upon. Though he began with painting, he and his brother as school kids had created an unofficial theatre group of St. Patrick School and represented the school in YMCA competitions. They won most of the awards and that meant the unofficial theatre group getting discovered by the school authorities. “Our Principal congratulated us and encouraged us to participate in such events ‘officially,”' smiles Ram.After that encouragement, theatre remained with the two brothers. Despite pursuing science and applying for CDS, Ram went on to do a PG Diploma in acting on his brother's suggestion, after which he did his MA in performing arts and won a gold medal. “During this time, I was assisting a friend for an acting workshop in school. I was supposed to be there in the evening, but after the first day, I was there from the morning. I was thrilled and excited about working with children and then the school offered me the job of part-time drama teacher,” he recollects.With the completion of his course and his coming in contact with young kids from slums in and around Charminar in the Old City to form the Koshish Theatre Group, he begun his crusade.From then on, theatre became his weapon and he started performing street plays on various aspects like communal harmony, national integration, girl child, child labour, education, AIDS, nutritional problems, environmental problems (including pollution, deforestation), water harvesting and lots more to bring awareness among the people.Besides acting, directing and teaching, there is another ‘part' which he plays. After completion of his standard X, he had joined Torn Curtains as a production assistant. “Here I did everything from moping, creating background props, painting, getting water and refreshments for all.

Kids at school teach you everyday. As a teacher I only assist them, like my Principal I encourage them to come up with suggestions and thoughts on a particular scene or story. I don't teach them dialogue delivery and facial expression, it comes naturally to them. My students are all rounders; they know everything from backstage management to costume designing. And when it comes to giving names they are experts,” he laughs.Ram also had the opportunity to teach special kids, “Their intelligence and enthusiasm encourages me at every step.

  Nearly 90 per cent of the world's adult population consumes caffeine daily. Next to water, coffee and tea are the most widely consumed drinks in the world. Children take caffeine mostly in the form of chocolates, ice cream and caffeinated soft drinks. Coffee and tea contain several compounds that may have both beneficial and adverse health effects: caffeine and antioxidants (eg, polyphenols, catechins, and flavonoids). The following is a brief overview of these effects.
Neuropsychiatric effects: As anyone cramming all night for an exam or working a night shift knows, caffeine increases alertness and energy, and improves attention, mood, psychomotor performance, and working memory.Sixty five mg of caffeine (150 ml of instant coffee) has a modest painkilling effect in tension and migraine headaches. In fact, many OTC medications for migraine contain large doses of caffeine. On the other hand, chronic caffeine consumption may be associated with headache - which is also a symptom of caffeine withdrawal!Long-term caffeine use has a mild protective effect against Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease.Taking more than five cups of coffee/day can cause anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, irritability, and even panic attacks.
Heart effects: Taking up to three cups of coffee per day may protect against myocardial infarction. In susceptible individuals, heavy coffee use can trigger heart rhythm abnormalities and other cardiac disorders. Contrary to popular opinion, caffeine has little or no effect on blood pressure in habitual coffee drinkers, nor does it increase the risk of hypertension.
Endocrine and gastrointestinal effects: Taking coffee or tea reduces the risk of developing type-2 diabetes mellitus. Among alcoholics, caffeine reduces the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver. Caffeine is a potent stimulator of the intestines and helps prevent constipation.
Cancer: Although population studies suggest that intake of green tea may prevent several cancers, hard evidence from prospective studies is lacking. Randomized studies on caffeinated drinks and cancer are difficult to do because most cancers have a long latency period.
Musculoskeletal effects: In women with low calcium intake, caffeinated drinks increase the risk of osteoporosis. Among athletes, caffeine improves performance across a wide range of physical activities. The International Olympic Committee prohibits urinary caffeine concentrations of more than 12 mcg/ml. To stay within the legal limit, athletes should limit their intake of coffee to two to three cups per day (or the equivalent intake for other forms of caffeine).

  | Photo Credit: THE HINDU “Ichi, ni, san, shi, go…” the scream startled me as I drew close to Kofukan Shito Ryu Karate School . The master, G.S.Suresh came to my rescue just when I was wondering what those words meant.“It is simple counting in Japanese,” he smiled. The force with each of those numbers were pronounced fascinated me and I too joined the trainees instantly.“Karate is a Japanese martial art of self defence. It is necessarily not about protecting yourself when left in the lurch. Rather we concentrate to improve presence of mind. It is about how quick you respond to a situation. Karate helps in optimising this power in the body. In due course, blood circulation improves and mind gets relaxed increasing the fitness levels. As a result, even under trying circumstances you don’t panic and are able to take correct decisions,” Mr. Suresh elaborates.Impressed by his briefing, I take on. Broadly categorised as exercises for beginners, there are simple techniques for those in the next level and advanced techniques for those with two years experience. The class began with the callisthenics, partially warm-up and cool-down, that prepares the body for the strenuous fight-outs or sparring.It started with eye ball rotation to strengthen the optic nerve and improve blood circulation in the eye followed by neck, shoulder, hip and hand rotations. Push ups were a bit difficult for me as I had to do the drill with knuckles and fingers. Next was a series of sit ups to strengthen abdomen, thigh and calf muscles. Though I was at ease in raising the leg and skipping, I found the set of drills with toes a tough proposition. Pressing the toes down I had to lift my body followed by frog jump and duck walk. With that ended the first level exercises.“Once you are through with these drills, your confidence improves and now you are ready to face sterner tests and strenuous routines,” the master continued.Next on the list were punches, blocks and kicks. There were middle, upper, lower and double punches and middle, upper, lower and outer blocks. The kicks involved front, slap, side, scissor kick, jump kick and leg block. Definitely it was not easy for me, as for most of the session I was watching karatekas doing some sparring to perfect the technique.“All these kicks, punches and blocks serve as good stretch exercises to tone your muscles well. Moreover these drills help gain full control over the body and improve reflexes. In general, karate is a whole body exercise which prunes physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual abilities. In short it develops a positive mentality,” Mr. Suresh explained.For more details dial 9788692808 for Mr. Suresh",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/A-punch-here-and-a-kick-there/article16299080.ece

A record 22 Asian women stood in this election for all three main parties. Until now no Asian women have ever been elected as MPs.The first male Asian MP, the Indian Dadabhai Naoroji, was elected in 1892 for Finsbury in central London. Mohammad Sarwar became the U.K.'s first Muslim MP after winning Glasgow Central in 1997. Sayeeda Warsi became the first Muslim woman to sit on the front bench for the Conservatives in 2007 — as a baroness (member of the House of Lords) rather than as an MP.An Oxford University graduate and barrister, Ms. Mahmood is the daughter of the Birmingham Labour party's chairman and stood against another woman Asian candidate for the Conservatives, Nusrat Ghani. Her selection caused consternation among local activists but was fiercely backed by party chiefs.Speaking last month, Ms. Mahmood stressed that Muslim women were interested in politics and her candidacy showed that a role in the Commons was open to all ethnic minorities.“The image of the voiceless Muslim woman who cannot leave the house is just not true, they are interested in politics. Parliament is for the people — all of the people — and the ethnic minority population should claim it.” Ms. Mahmood said she had also faced fears that she would not be accepted by the Asian community.Ms. Qureshi (46), a Pakistan-born barrister, moved to the U.K. when she was nine. She advised the former London Mayor, Ken Livingstone, on human rights. She has also previously headed the criminal legal section of the U.N.

  Asking the UCPN (Maoist) to forge consensus among political parties and withdraw the indefinite strike, a massive peace assembly was held in Kathmandu on Friday.In a late development, the Maoists withdrew the indefinite general strike they called on Sunday. The withdrawal comes after the party faced immense pressure from all sectors.Earlier, speakers at the peace assembly, attended by thousands of people, said they did not elect leaders to trouble the citizens, but to respect their feelings. The speakers asked political parties to come to an agreement in two days' time and ease the situation. The assembly was attended by doctors, engineers, celebrities, lawyers, teachers, students, engineers, journalists and the common people. Most people were dressed in white, carried the national flag and held placards with messages like “stop the bandh” and “we want peace.”However, as the strike entered the sixth day, senior Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai said his party would rather change the nature of the protest now than withdraw it. On the other hand, the major coalition partner of the CPN (UML)-led government maintained that there can be no change in the government through the pressure created by the Maoists.The United Nations and its humanitarian partners have expressed concern about the problems created by the prolonged strike in this donor-dependent country.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Massive-peace-assembly-amid-Maoist-strike/article16299301.ece

  Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) on Friday ceased to exist, ending a political saga of over two decades of non-violent resistance to the continuing military rule in Myanmar.The party attracted “automatic dissolution” upon refusing to re-register under the junta's poll decrees, promulgated two months ago as the framework for a promised general election at an unspecified time. The timeline for re-registration ended at the stroke of midnight on Thursday.The NLD leaders and activists will, however, seek to transform the now-defunct party into a social service organisation, according to Nyan Win, Ms. Suu Kyi's close political associate. Details of the proposed outfit have not yet been finalised.Mr. Nyan Win told The Hindu from Yangon that the new move was in line with the “opinion of Ms. Suu Kyi,” still serving her latest term of house arrest. On a parallel track, four ex-NLD-leaders decided to form a new political party under the tentative name of a national democratic force.Tracing how the NLD was now passing into history, he said the Myanmar Supreme Court had in fact refused to accept an application from her for a ruling that the junta's current election laws were illegal.Her main contention was that the decree on registration of political parties for the promised poll was so crafted as to have the effect of banning the NLD. To retain recognition as a political party, the NLD was required to distance itself from her on the ground that she was serving a “judicial sentence” upon being found “guilty” of violating the restrictions under her previous term of house arrest.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Suu-Kyis-party-looks-beyond-dissolution/article16299125.ece

  North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il on Friday ended his four-day secretive visit to China, telling his hosts he was willing to help revive stalled negotiations over his country's controversial nuclear programme.“The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is willing to work with you to create favourable conditions for a resumption of the talks,” Mr. Kim told Chinese President Hu Jintao, according to a report in the Chinese official media.Mr. Kim this week held extensive meetings with Mr. Hu, and also met Premier Wen Jiabao and the seven other top leaders of the ruling Communist Party — a rare occurrence for a visiting head of state, reflecting the unique relationship between the two countries and the importance with which China views ties with its internationally-isolated neighbour.Official media quoted Mr. Kim as saying he was willing “to create favourable conditions” to resume the stalled six-party talks — the dialogue framework with South Korea, the United States, Japan and Russia over the North's controversial nuclear programme. North Korea quit the talks after the United Nations imposed sanctions following a nuclear test conducted last April.Whether the statement suggested the stalled talks would actually resume remained unclear. South Korea's Yonhap news agency, which has close ties to South Korean intelligence, reported that Mr. Kim had all but committed his willingness to return to talks during a banquet with Mr. Hu on Wednesday. However, Chinese analysts cautioned that the wording of Mr. Kim's statement left enough wiggle-room for other interpretations.During his visit, his first to China in four years, Mr. Kim also sought greater Chinese financial and food aid, amid persisting economic troubles and resource shortages in North Korea. “China will, as always, support the DPRK's economic development and improving people's livelihood,” Mr. Wen reportedly told the North Korean leader.China's media had, until Friday, blacked out all coverage of the visit of the North Korean leader, who insists on a high degree of secrecy for his state visits citing security fears. He arrived in north-eastern China on Tuesday, crossing the border in his armoured train. Mr. Kim has a fear of flying.Much of the focus this past week has been on the extreme secrecy with which the Chinese authorities have handled the visit, as well as on the massive security arrangements that have been put in place.An entire town in the north-east was essentially under police lockdown, and reporters had been barred from covering any part of the trip.Japanese journalists who managed to sneak a photograph of a frail-looking and limping Mr. Kim leaving a luxury hotel in the city of Dalian were detained by police.Official confirmation of Mr. Kim's “unofficial visit” came only after the North Korean leader was safely back in his home country on Friday.Even on Thursday afternoon, the Foreign Ministry claimed it “had no information” over Mr. Kim's visit, though grainy television images broadcast on South Korean media had left little doubt over his presence in the only country he can call an ally.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Will-work-with-Beijing-on-N-talks-Kim/article16299124.ece

  Gordon Brown returned to Downing Street — the London home of the British Premier — on Friday morning in a symbolic gesture that he is still Prime Minister, as all three of the main party leaders awaited the final results that will determine where the power lies in what certain to be a hung Parliament.Mr. Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron are locked in a constitutional standoff. The Tory leader claimed Labour had lost the right to govern but the Prime Minister, confident the Tories had not secured an overall majority, said he would look to see if he could form an alliance with the Liberal Democrats.All three leaders are now regrouping to plan their next move. Mr. Brown has the Constitution on his side and will have the first chance to form a government. But the Tories are claiming he does not retain the “moral authority” to govern, given the scale of the defeat, and the Lib Dems are wary of a coalition that does not have popular support, given their disappointing performance at the polls.With just a few seats left to declare, Mr. Cameron asserted that his party was on course to gain more seats than at any time in 80 years. He said it was clear that the country wants change that requires new leadership. He needs 326 to win an overall majority, something Tory insiders privately accept is out of their reach. Sources in the party said early on Friday that they expected to reach 314, which would be enough to operate with the support of the Democratic Unionists in Northern Ireland.Lord Mandelson told Sky News this morning : “The Prime Minister's duty is to stay at his post, to continue doing his job and not resign until it is clear who the Queen should call as an alternative to form a new government, should Mr Brown not be able to do so. The Prime Minister can't just resign and leave a vacuum for the Queen to deal with.” In the case of a hung Parliament, Lord Mandelson said: “Either there has to be a minority government which tries its chances or a combination of other parties — in this case most likely the Labour party and Liberal Democrats — would have to see if they can form some arrangement instead.” Amid vastly different regional swings, the results showed strong Labour resilience outside the south, and the Lib Dems had badly underperformed against euphoric expectations of only a week ago.Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was said to be depressed by the result, and wary of forming a “coalition of the defeated” that might be seen as ignoring the public mood. Mr. Brown flew to London from his Scottish constituency to offer the Lib Dems the chance to form a stable government, culminating in a referendum on electoral reform for the Commons.Mr. Clegg will wait to see the final result and meet his new group of MPs tomorrow. Some in his party will claim he can form a stable coalition for two years to deliver recovery and political reform, but others will be nervous of appearing to shun the electorate's will. The Tory leader, reflecting on the coming battle for power with Mr. Brown, promised to put the national interest first in “the hours ahead, or perhaps longer than the hours ahead”.Speaking after he had been returned in Kirkcaldy with an increased majority, Mr. Brown said: “My duty to the country coming out of this election is to play my part in Britain having a strong, stable and principled government able to lead Britain into sustained economic recovery and able to implement our commitments to far—reaching reform upon which there is a growing consensus in our country.” Mr. Brown's aides said they would try to form a progressive alliance if the Tories did not score as high as 320 seats. Private talks between intermediaries started almost as soon as the polls closed, but few were willing to predict the outcome.

  | Photo Credit: Alastair Grant The Conservative Party was on Friday in talks with the Liberal Democrats to form a minority government with their support after Britain's most closely-contested election of modern times resulted in a hung Parliament and defeat for the ruling Labour Party after 13 years in power.Conservative leader David Cameron and his Lib Dem counterpart, Nick Clegg, spoke on the phone and agreed to hold further discussions. This effectively put paid to Gordon Brown's hopes of staying on as Prime Minister with the Lib Dems' backing as part of a “progressive alliance.”The first move towards a deal with the Conservatives came from Mr. Clegg even as the results were still coming in. In a statement, he said that as the single largest party with “more votes and more seats” the Conservatives should have the right to seek to govern first.“It is vital that all parties… act in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage,” he said in an apparent reference to Mr. Brown's bid to hang on to power taking advantage of the British constitutional convention, under which the incumbent Prime Minister has the right to stay on until he/she is defeated on the floor of the House.Mr. Cameron was quick to reciprocate with what he described as “a big, open and comprehensive offer” to the Lib Dems claiming that the two had a common position on a number of issues. In remarks that were seen as a hint at a coalition with the Lib Dems rather than simply issue-based support, he said: “I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems — the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system,” he said.Mr. Cameron, whose party is expected to end up with 306 seats — 20 short of an outright majority — pointedly referred to Mr. Brown as the “outgoing Prime Minister” saying he had “lost the mandate to govern.” People, he said, had voted for “change” and a new type of politicsStressing the need for political stability at a time of deep economic crisis, he said: “We need a government that reassures the international markets. We need policies that will bring economic recovery.”Earlier, in a brief statement, Mr. Brown said he respected Mr. Clegg's wish to make contact with the Conservatives first but “should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing... I would be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties.”According to reports, the Lib Dems have not closed the door on negotiations with Labour but might demand change of leader as a condition for support. Both Labour and the Conservatives were also wooing smaller regional parties such as the Scottish National Party, the Unionist parties of Northern Ireland and the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru.Labour is expected to end with 258 MPs and the Lib Dems 57.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Conservatives-in-talks-with-Liberal-Democrats-in-Britain/article16299267.ece

Neither of the two main parties would be able to govern with a majority of their own.Mr. Brown cited the “immediate economic challenges,” including the Greek crisis and the “deteriorating situation in the euro area” as reasons why a quick solution to the stalemate must be found.

  An Australian opposition Senator, who dubbed burqa as “un—Australian” and sought its ban in the country, has been criticised by the Muslim community as well as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi lashed out in an article which was published on The Drum website, saying the burqa “needs to be binned“.Mr. Bernardi’s comment has irked Australia’s peak Islamic organisation which has reacted with disappointment over comments.He called it a “repressive domination of men over women” and said it establishes “different sets and expectations in society“.Mr. Rudd today accused the opposition of playing a cynical political exercise by floating the idea and said: “I think they are walking both sides of the street on this one....having someone like Bernardi go out there and talk this up.”“It’s a pretty interesting exercise in cynical politics” he added.In his article, Mr. Bernardi said it was unfair that people with motorcycle helmets had to remove them to identify themselves, where women wearing burqas did not because of religious freedom.“As an avid motorcyclist I am required to remove my helmet before entering a bank or petrol station,” he said.“It’s a security measure for the businesses and no reasonable person objects to this requirement.“However, if I cover myself in a black cloth from head to toe, with only my eyes barely visible behind a mesh guard, I am effectively unidentifiable and can waltz into any bank unchallenged in the name of religious freedom.”However, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said a ban on the burqa was not coalition policy.Muhammad Dahir from Islamic Association of Australia said the burqa is not a compulsory part of Islamic culture and most women have no problem showing their face to identify themselves.“If people want to see your face, then there’s nothing wrong with that, they have to accept these things. The majority of the Muslim community have no problem with that,” he said admitting there were some areas of society where men will force their wives to wear a burqa, but for the rest, it was a woman’s choice to cover herself completely.Mr. Bernardi also said Australia also needs to move towards a full ban and that migrating Muslims need to adopt Australian values.“New arrivals to this country should not come here to recreate the living environment they have just left,” he said.“They should come here for a better life based on the freedoms and values that have built our great nation.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Australian-Senator-flayed-for-burqa-comments/article16299017.ece

  North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has reaffirmed his nation’s commitment to multilateral talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, China said on Friday.Mr. Kim gave the commitment at talks on Wednesday with President Hu Jintao, China’s official Xinhua news agency said in its first confirmation of a secretive visit by Mr. Kim.The agency quoted Mr. Kim as telling Mr. Hu that North Korea “remains unchanged in sticking to de—nuclearisation on the Korean peninsula.” He said North Korea wanted to “work with China to create favourable conditions for restarting the six—party talks,” referring to negotiations involving North Korea, China, the United States, South Korea, Japan and Russia.Mr. Hu and Mr. Kim discussed the six—party talks and other international and regional issues, the agency said.North Korea abandoned the six—party talks in April 2009.Mr. Hu was quoted as telling Mr. Kim that the two nations should “deepen economic and trade cooperation,” and “strengthen coordination in international and regional affairs to better serve regional peace and stability.” Mr. Kim said he “fully agrees with Hu’s proposals on pragmatic cooperation” between North Korea and China, the agency said.Hu accepted an invitation from Kim to visit North Korea at a date to be decided, it said.Mr. Kim and Mr. Hu visited a biotechnology company in Beijing, which Mr. Kim said gave him “new understandings of China’s development and progress,” the agency said.North Korea’s state news agency reported on Friday that Mr. Kim had paid an “unofficial visit to the People’s Republic of China” from Monday to Friday.Mr. Kim also visited the north—eastern Chinese port cities of Tianjin and Dalian, Xinhua quoted a report by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency as saying.Mr. Kim’s special train is believed to have left Beijing on Thursday afternoon.Beijing followed its usual protocol by declining to confirm Mr. Kim’s visit until he had left China. It was his first visit to China in four years.Diplomats in Beijing had expected Kim to ask China, one of the hermit state’s few allies, for economic aid and investment. Economic aid could sweeten Pyongyang’s willingness to re—engage in the six—party talks, analysts said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Kim-committed-to-nuclear-talks-says-China/article16299010.ece

  As federal investigators try hard to find any possible link between Faisal Shahzad and terror groups in Pakistan, a top American general today said militant outfits like the LeT, blamed for the 26/11 attacks, has “transnational goals” like the Al-Qaeda.“The extremists in many cases would like to be transnational organisations, not just active in Pakistan, but indeed active elsewhere.“Al Qaeda, of course, is foremost among them, LeT, who carried out the Mumbai attack, another organisation with transnational goals and activities,” General David Petraeus, Commander of the US Central Command, told the MSNBC in an interview.His comments assume significance in the wake of US investigators probing whether Pakistani—American Faisal Shahzad, arrested for the failed Times Square bomb attack, had any links with Pakistani Taliban or other extremist groups based in the tribal areas of Pakistan.The FBI had on Wednesday said 30—year—old Shahzad had admitted to attending a terror training camp in the restive Waziristan tribal region.Gen. Petraeus was recently in Pakistan holding meetings with its top leadership on how to take action against these terrorist outfits.“It may be that the Pakistani Taliban has some of these (goals) as well...The way they generate resources, the way they get recruits, they way they can proselytise is indeed by successful high— profile operations. You’ve seen that as well with the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Anwar al—Awlaki, the Yemeni—American,” Gen. Petraeus said.He said the extremist elements that are out there are learning and adaptive organisations.“There’s been a lot of thought about that. But, you know, you had the planes flown into tall buildings, what is the next initiative going to be? And certainly this is among those. There has been an outreach through cyberspace.“It’s one reason that some of us have said we can’t allow cyberspace, which is a battlefield, just like a ground battlefield, to be uncontested space. We have to be active there as well, while certainly still ensuring the rights and freedoms of Americans, to be sure,” he said.Gen. Petraeus was in Pakistan, when the Times Square incident happened.He said the countries have to show “sustained and substantial” commitment in fighting terror elements.“We have recognised the impressive campaign that the Pakistani military has carried out in Swat Valley and in these other areas of their country where the Pakistani Taliban was threatening the Pakistani governance,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/LeT-has-transnational-goals-Gen.-Petraeus/article16299024.ece
520,Uncertainty as Britain grapples with hung Parliament,PTI,2010-05-07,09:28:49 IST,"Uncertainty reigned on Friday as Britain’s main parties headed for an intense power battle after the general election resulted in a hung Parliament.The situation in which neither of the two big parties gained enough votes to form a government on its own was confirmed by results from most of the 649 constituencies.After results in 615 constituencies were counted, the Tories had 290 seats, followed by Labour with 247 and the Liberal Democrats with 51.The results mean it will be impossible for the Tories to reach the minimum of 326 seats required for an overall majority.The ruling Labour Party under Prime Minister Gordon Brown has indicated that it would aim to stay on in government with the support of smaller parties.Speaking after his re-election in his constituency in Scotland, Mr. Brown said it was his duty to secure a strong and stable government in Britain.“The outcome of this country’s vote is not yet known, but my duty to the country, coming out of this election, is to play my part in Britain having a strong, stable and principled government, able to lead Britain into sustained economic recovery,” he said.The official result of the election is expected later Friday.As the wait for clarity continued, Mr. Brown was locked in talks with his closest aides in Downing Street to assess the possibilities of a government pact with smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats.But there were clear signs that the process would be drawn out.The Liberal Democratic Party, led by Nick Clegg, said it would hold a meeting on Saturday to consider whether to enter into an alliance with Labour, or Mr. David Cameron’s Conservatives.Meanwhile, there were no signs that Queen Elizabeth II, who would have to “invite” the future government leader, was in any hurry to do so.The monarch, who was staying at the Windsor Castle outside London, was unlikely to become involved until the situation became clear, Constitutional experts said.It was her view that it was “up to the politicians to get together to produce a solution,” said one expert.“The monarch is not a referee,” he said, adding that the monarchy would be damaged if her role was seen to be “politicised.” It was already clear that Labour had lost the mandate to govern, Mr. Cameron said early on Friday.But Peter Mandelson, the Business Secretary and key Labour strategist, insisted that Labour could seek to form a government.“The rules are that if it’s a hung parliament, it’s not the party with the largest number of seats that has first go — it’s the sitting government,” he said.However, when asked whether the situation would become less intractable if Mr. Brown resigned and Labour put forward another candidate for the party leadership, he said: “All sorts of things are possible.” The result was a shock for the Liberal Democrats, led by Mr. Clegg, who appeared set to win fewer seats than in the last general election in 2005.Mr. Clegg, who had been branded the “superstar” of the 2010 election, campaigning for the Liberal Democrats to be given greater weight in Britain’s traditional two-party system, on Friday described the results for his party as disappointing.“We simply haven’t achieved what we had hoped,” he said.The key question now is whether the Liberal Democrats, desperate to seize the chance of a lifetime, would back Labour in a Lib-Lab pact.The Liberals have been campaigning for electoral reform, aimed at replacing the present majority first-past-the-post system with proportional representation.Several top Labour politicians indicated on Friday that the party would be prepared to hold talks on the issue.Under the unwritten rules of Britain’s constitution, the sitting Prime Minister has the first option to ask Queen Elizabeth II for the chance to form a government.However, convention also states that the party with the most seats has the “moral” right to ask to form a government.Markets showed signs of nervousness early Friday, as shares fell under the dual pressure of the Greek debt crisis and the hung parliament in Britain.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Uncertainty-as-Britain-grapples-with-hung-Parliament/article16299325.ece

That change is going to require new leadership. We will stand ready to do all we can to bring that leadership,” Daily Mail quoted Cameron as saying.He said that Labour “had clearly lost its mandate to govern“There were significant swings from Labour to the Tories in the first two seats to declared. It was 11.6 percent in Washington and Sunderland West and 8.4 percent in Houghton and Sunderland South.Brown told constituents: “The outcome of this country’s vote is not yet known, but my duty to the country, coming out of this election, is to play my part in Britain having a strong, stable and principled government, able to lead Britain into sustained economic recovery.”He thanked supporters for their unwavering support and also thanked his wife, Sarah, for her love and support.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Labour-has-lost-mandate-to-govern-David-Cameron/article16299004.ece

  Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese president, held talks in Beijing with Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Mr. Kim paid an unofficial visit to China from May 3 to 7 as Mr. Hu’s guest. During their talks, Mr. Hu expressed warm welcome to Mr. Kim on behalf of the CPC, Chinese government and people.Mr. Hu also expressed gratitude for the condolence from the DPRK to earthquake—hit Yushu in northwest China, as well as the DPRK’s active participation in the World Expo in Shanghai.During Mr. Kim’s stay in Beijing, Mr. Hu hosted a welcoming banquet in honour of Mr. Kim and accompanied Mr. Kim in a visit to a biological company. Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and Wen Jiabao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese premier, met with Mr. Kim respectively.Other members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang, respectively accompanied Mr. Kim for the visiting tour. Mr. Hu said the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK is the common treasures of the two governments, parties and peoples, and it is the historical responsibility of the two sides to push forward their friendship with the progress of the times and from generation to generation.He said in recent years, Sino—DPRK relations have made continuous achievements, and last year in particular, the two countries celebrated the 60th anniversary of Sino—DPRK diplomatic ties and successfully held the Year of Friendship, and the political contacts and cooperation in all areas have been fruitful.Strengthening Sino—DPRK friendly and cooperative relations is the consistent policy of the CPC and the Chinese government, he said.Mr. Hu said China always handles, maintains and pushes forward the relations with the DPRK in a strategic and long—term perspective, and will make joint efforts with the DPRK to upgrade the relationship to benefit the two peoples and to contribute to lasting regional peace and common prosperity.Mr. Hu said boosting Sino—DPRK cooperation helps the two countries promote their own socialist construction, and safeguard and develop the common interests as well as regional peace, stability and prosperity. He put forward five proposals to strengthen ties with the DPRK: ——To maintain high—level contacts. The leaders of the two countries should keep in touch by exchanging visits, as well as sending special envoys and messages.——To reinforce strategic coordination. The two sides should exchange views in a timely manner and regularly on major domestic and diplomatic issues, international and regional situation, as well as on governance experience.——To deepen economic and trade cooperation. The relevant departments of the two governments should discuss and explore ways on expanding economic and trade cooperation.——To increase personnel exchanges. The two sides should expand exchanges in the cultural, sports, and educational fields, and the contacts between the youth in particular to inherit the traditional friendship from generation to generation.——To strengthen coordination in international and regional affairs to better serve regional peace and stability.Mr. Kim said he fully agrees with Mr. Hu’s proposals on pragmatic cooperation between the two countries.The traditional DPRK—China friendship, established and cultivated by leaders of old generations of the two states, has stood tests of the times, and will not change due to the change of time and alteration of generations, Mr. Kim said.The series of celebration activities marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties last year lifted the DPRK—China friendship to a new high in history, he said.With the joint efforts from the two sides, sound momentum of development has emerged in bilateral friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields, Mr. Kim said, noting the recent agreement on the construction of a new bridge over the border river, the Yalu River, will become a new symbol of DPRK—China friendly cooperation.With the principle of mutual benefit and win—win, the DPRK welcomes Chinese enterprises to invest in the country and will actively lift the level and quality of bilateral pragmatic cooperation, Mr. Kim said.The DPRK Party and government always view and handle relations with China from a strategic and long—term point of view, and are determined to inherit and pass on the DPRK—China relations, which have seen continuous consolidation and development, he said.Mr. Kim expressed his warm congratulations on the successful opening of the World Expo in Shanghai and his condolence to the casualty and property loss caused by the earthquake in Yushu, Qinghai Province.During each of his visits to China, Mr. Kim said, he could witness the new achievements made by Chinese people in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.China’s achievements are a great encouragement to the people of the DPRK, he said.The DPRK’s work in various fields is progressing orderly, and the core task of all the work of the DPRK party is to constantly improve the living standard of the people, Mr. Kim said.Mr. Hu spoke highly of DPRK’s active measures which have been taken to maintain stability, boost economy and improve people’s living conditions. He also expressed his wishes for the DPRK to achieve greater goals in the nation’s development under the leadership of the WPK, headed by Mr. Kim.Mr. Kim said he believes that under the leadership of the CPC, with President Hu as general secretary, Chinese people will continuously record new victories in the historical progress of improving the party’s ruling capability, practicing the scientific concept on development and building a harmonious society.Mr. Kim invited Mr. Hu to visit DPRK at his convenience. Mr. Hu appreciated and accepted the invitation.Mr. Hu also accompanied Mr. Kim in a visit to a bio—company in Beijing. During the visit, Mr. Kim said he got new understandings of China’s development and progress in relevant fields, especially in harmonious development and innovation, compared with the last visit to China four years ago.The DPRK people are proud of China’s achievements in its national development, he said. During the China tour, Mr. Kim also visited some economic development zones, bonded ports, and several food—processing, hi—tech and machinery companies in the cities of Dalian, Tianjin, Beijing and Shenyang.In Dalian, a booming coastal city in northeast China, Mr. Kim instructed DPRK officials in his delegation to study the experience of China’s renovation of its old industrial base.In Tianjin, Mr. Kim spoke highly of the development of a bonded port in the economic hub in north China.Mr. Kim’s entourage included Kim Yong Chun, vice chairman of the National Defence Commission, and senior officials with the DPRK’s foreign ministry, the WPK Central Committee and the DRPK cabinet.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Top-leaders-of-China-North-Korea-hold-talks-in-Beijing/article16299023.ece
523,Unfair to focus only on Pakistan: Roemer,Sandeep Dikshit,2010-05-07,02:35:12 IST,"The United States has decried focussing only on Pakistan in regard to terrorism, by pointing out that there were terrorist groups in all parts of the world. It also expressed its willingness to carry out joint projects with India in Afghanistan, but the foreign office here distanced itself from any such proposal.Briefing journalists after returning from Kabul and Islamabad, U.S. Ambassador Timothy Roemer said that while Pakistan must do more to tackle terrorism, the focus should not be on that county alone, as there were other groups such as the Indian Mujahideen, which Indian intelligence agencies claim are operating all across the country.“Let's not focus on one particular country — we have Indian Mujahideen, we have Headley in Chicago, we have Faisal Shahzad [alleged to have attempted a bombing in Times Square]. It is very clear that the U.S. has said to Pakistan that we want more...We see it doing. We expect more.”“Whether we call a group Al-Qaeda, LeT [Lashkar-e-Taiba], JeM [Jaish-e-Mohammad] whatever the name, we have a serpent network of extremist groups targeting all of us — whether it is Pakistanis, whether it is Indians, whether it is Americans and we have to work together.” Mr. Roemer said the cooperation between the U.S. and India in the case of David Headley (prime accused in Mumbai terror attacks on November 26, 2008) was “unprecedented,” with both sides having exchanged “reams of information” on the issue. India now needs to work out the exact timings and dates to get access to Headley, currently in U.S. custody.Eyebrows were raised in the External Affairs Ministry over Mr. Roemer's claim that in Kabul he assessed the possibility of joint India-U.S. projects in areas such as capacity building for civil servants. “As far as we know, the U.S. Ambassador to India was interested in the projects we had done. There is no such move to undertake joint projects,” clarified sources.Asked about Pakistan's response on Afghanistan, Mr. Roemer said most of his interaction with its President and Foreign Minister fell in the zone of privileged diplomatic conversation. “Pakistan's response was thoughtful, considered and responsible in many ways. It showed they continued to think very clearly,” he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Unfair-to-focus-only-on-Pakistan-Roemer/article16298970.ece
524,Pakistan hopes talks will not be hit,Anita Joshua,2010-05-07,00:03:11 IST,"As news broke of Ajmal Kasab being awarded the death sentence for his role in the Mumbai 2008 terror attacks, Pakistan on Thursday hoped that non-state actors, and shrill statements made by a section of Indian polity and officialdom would not derail the dialogue that was resumed in Thimphu only last week.Asked for a reaction by the media at a routine briefing just as television channels were beaming the trial court verdict, Foreign Office spokesman Abdul Basit — in the first official reaction to the death sentence — said legal experts would need to go through the detailed judgment first. At the same time, he pointed out that Pakistan had strongly condemned the horrific Mumbai attack and said “it is important that culprits are brought to book.''On the specific issue of observations by Indian officials that the verdict was a message to Pakistan that it should not export terror, Mr. Basit said: “It is important to avoid such far-fetched statements as both countries have agreed to resume dialogue.''Meanwhile, in an interview to “Devil's Advocate'' on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was optimistic of the spirit of dialogue prevailing over hiccups like Kasab's conviction and indictment of Hafiz Saeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi of the Lashkar-e-Taiba.Stating that the prime ministers of India and Pakistan have acknowledged dialogue as the only sensible way forward, he said: “Yes, there will be difficulties and hiccups but we have to move on. We have a much bigger agenda and we should not let any individual, non-state actor or any terrorist organisation impede the peace process. We should develop it to such an extent that it becomes irreversible.''On whether Pakistan would accept the death sentence or plead for leniency, Mr. Qureshi said: “We will have to respect each other's judicial process.'' As for Pakistan seeking Kasab's extradition, the Minister pointed out that it was not the decision of the government but a requirement of the court. “The Government of Pakistan was conveying the decision of the court.'' This distinction was again drawn by the Foreign Office spokesman at his weekly briefing.Contesting the charge made by the media that Pakistan has been spineless in its response when cases are filed against its nationals overseas, Mr. Basit said the government has always provided legal aid where it is legitimate. “We need to draw a distinction between where assistance is legitimately required and where it is not.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Pakistan-hopes-talks-will-not-be-hit/article13797885.ece
525,Seven steps to control your Facebook privacy,DPA,2010-05-07,19:24:45 IST,"Exerting a complete lockdown on your Facebook information is a complicated task that someone should write a book about, and which would take eternal vigilance to maintain.But casual users of the world’s most popular social networking website can take seven easy steps to safeguard sensitive personal information and prevent it appearing to other Facebook users, marketers and across the Internet.1. Make friends with your Profile Privacy Page: spend 1 per cent of your Facebook time exploring what it can do for you.2. Control your contact information: you should limit it to close friends or — better yet — nobody. Let people contact you via a Facebook message.3. Your “friends” aren’t really your friends: they include acquaintances, family and professional contacts. Put people into different Friend Lists — private groupings of people who can be given different privacy settings.4. Pay attention to photos: avoid the ultimate Facebook nightmare — being tagged in an embarrassing photo that everyone can then see.This is a little confusing and can be found under the Friends, Tags and Connections section in the privacy settings.5. Control who can see your albums via the photos privacy page.6. Remove your Facebook info from search engines like Google via the search privacy settings page.7.

526,Your life is an open book if you use Facebook,DPA,2010-05-07,19:22:21 IST,"Facebook has drawn flak from consumer groups for not taking user privacy seriously enough.
  As the world’s most popular social networking site, Facebook has more data on us than any other private company, and a lot more than most governments.So it can be both disconcerting and dangerous when the website — whether as a matter of policy or by mistake — lets out a lot more information than we would like.Unfortunately for Facebook and its users, that’s happening all too frequently. As the magazine PC World so succinctly put it after the last debacle: “Another day, another Facebook security snafu.” The latest glitch was revealed on Wednesday when Facebook said it had fixed a security bug that allowed user’s to snoop on their friends’ private chats and view the pending friend requests by others.In March, a bug exposed the private emails of many users and limited their ability to hide other contact information.In December, Facebook changed its privacy settings, sparking a new Facebook protest group that now boasts more than 2.2 million members.The new settings automatically share members’ information, unless they take specific steps to opt out of the info giveaway. That meant that your name, profile picture, gender, current city, networks, Friends List and all the pages you subscribe to were made publicly available and searchable for anyone on the web to see.Prior to that there was Beacon, a Facebook information system that mined data from member profiles to send them targeted ads and displayed users visits to external sites on their Facebook stream.Though a mass public outcry prompted Facebook to quickly abandon that idea, its newly-announced OpenGraph initiative is proving just as controversial.Given that the aim of OpenGraph is to accompany Facebook members on their travels to every corner of the web, the problem could get much more serious.The OpenGraph initiative allows websites to adopt the Facebook Connect sign-in system so that users activities on other sites are shared with all their Facebook friends.Some aspects of the idea sound good in theory, because they will make the web more personal. But it also means that you could unwittingly expose your web activities to your wife, employer or anyone of the hundreds of people who might be “friends” on Facebook but who in reality are just as likely to be mere acquaintances, work colleagues or rivals.That possibility scares privacy advocates. The Electronic Privacy Information Centre, an advocacy group, filed a complaint on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission.“Facebook continues to manipulate the privacy settings of users and its own privacy policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited purpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes,” Marc Rotenberg, the group’s executive director, said in a letter to the commission.Facebook, which overtook MySpace as the platform of choice largely because of the control it gave users of their profiles, insists that it is fully focused on its members’ privacy needs.Elliott Schrage, Facebook’s vice-president for public policy, told The New York Times that “for a service that has grown as dramatically as we have grown, we think our track record for security and safety is unrivalled.” Many critics disagree, pointing to the flippant comments on privacy by billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 25, who said in January that privacy was no longer a “social norm.”“People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people,” he said. “That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.” He has a point, according to a recent study by Consumer Reports.The study of 2,000 online US households found that two-thirds of them used Facebook or MySpace. Of those, 52 per cent of them posted personal information that could pose a threat to them and their families, the report found.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/Your-life-is-an-open-book-if-you-use-Facebook/article16299087.ece

Well, going by that admission, the city is showing signs of arriving as Marrybrown, a Malaysian chain, has reached the city. True, we have Subway and Dominos (open only to Techies), but a popular fast food joint in the heart of the city is a first.Located at Panavila Junction, near the Bakery junction flyover, this 60-seater three-storied restaurant (the top floor might be turned into a party hall) is cosy. Actually a bit too cosy as the tables and seats (which are comfy) are too close for comfort.A quick look at the menu and it's the combo meals that catch your eye. We order combo 5, (which has a choice of either a rib and a drumstick or a thigh and wing) and combo 6 (two pieces of chicken, a side of coleslaw, a serving of mashed potato and a pet bottle of cola).Other interesting combos include combo 2 that has a double-decked burger (Rs. 149), a paneer wrap combo (Rs. 55) and combo 6 that has five pieces of fried chicken wings that is served with a hot and sweet dip (Rs. 99). All combo meals come with a side of fries and a glass of cola.We also order a kiddie meal (a choice of chicken or vegetarian burger, smileys or chicken poppers and a glass of orange juice) that comes with a surprise gift.The chicken has a crisp slightly spicy outer coating and is cooked just right. It is also not too oily. While the coleslaw has generous grated vegetables covered with a helping of mayonnaise, the mashed potato tastes as if it was cooked in stock. It has bits of pepper in it which gives the dish a bite. The chicken burger has a succulent thick pate placed in between a soft bun. Ground chicken meat that is mildly spiced is made into balls and fried for the chicken poppers.
Finger food
Those who have small appetites can order burgers and fried chicken a la carte. There is also a choice of finger food like chicken lollipop (Rs. 60), chicken nuggets (Rs. 55), nachos (Rs. 40) and Tandoori nuggets (Rs. 35). A choice of vegetarian and non-vegetarian rice meals are for those who need their daily dose of rice. While two pieces of fried chicken, a helping of coleslaw and pulau comprises the non-vegetarian, instead of fried chicken, it is smileys (potato wafers) that is different in the vegetarian version. The restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Contact: 4061010.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Food/Merry-times-ahead/article16299065.ece

  | Photo Credit: S.MAHINSHA Filmmaker T.K. Rajeevkumar's work defies categorisation. Viewers have learnt to expect the unexpected from this film director. After a lull, he returns with two films – Khushti in Hindi and Oru Naal Varum in Malayalam. Khushti is the remake of Mutharamkunnu P.O. while Oru Naal Varum revives the winning duo of Mohanlal and Sreenivasan on screen.While many other directors would take a break after the hectic shooting and promotional work, Rajeev plans to travel in India and Europe to document the sounds of percussion and to “jam with percussionists who play a wide range of interesting percussion instruments,” says Rajeev, a trained percussionist.Before Rajeev engraved his credits on the screen, he was a well-known name on the campuses of Kerala as a superb percussionist and mimic. One of his hit performances was a panchavadyam that faithfully duplicated the sounds and rhythms of a percussion ensemble without a single instrument on stage. “Over the years, I have become a little rusty and so I have started training in earnest on the mridangam, maddalam and also on other percussion instruments such as the thavil, thimila and the edakka,” says Rajeev.
Percussion yatra
He also plans to film the jamming sessions. The percussion yatra, which will also be filmed, will culminate in a concert in the capital city, adds Rajiv.He says it is the quest for new subjects and styles of filmmaking that keeps intact his passion for filmmaking. A passion that was ignited during his student days when Venu, a relative and a role model, joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to study cinematography. “G. Aravindan was also a relative and a family friend. I yearned to study filmmaking. The late seventies and early eighties were the heyday of film societies and the first ever Kerala University film festival opened my eyes to a new language and vocabulary of cinema,” says Rajeev.Although, he qualified for the entrance exam, he never made it to FTII as his parents were keen on him taking up a white collar job. But the Zoology graduate kept alive his silver screen dreams even while creating waves on the campuses with his mimicry and music troupes.“Once, after a show in Muhamma, entrepreneur Mathew Paul met me and asked me if I was interested in films. He directed me to Navodaya where I met my mentor Jijo. I made it clear to him that I had no interest in becoming an actor. I felt I did not have the looks to become one. When he heard of my attempt to join FTII and my ambition, he took me, still a student, on aboard the team of My Dear Kuttichathan, the first 3-D film in Malayalam,” recalls Rajeev.One thing led to another and soon the young director was calling the shots for the big budget multi-starrer Chanakyan, starring Kamal Hassan, Madhu, Thilakan and Jayaram. A dream break for any director. “My first shot was with Madhu sir. I still remember him putting me at ease by asking: ‘Rajiv, what is the next shot?' I was able to give him a convincing answer. Despite having a galaxy of veterans in my film, it was my film. Never once did any of them try to step into my space.”After the racy Chanakyan, just when everyone expected him to direct another action-packed film, Rajeev came out with the romance-filled Kshanakathu.“I did get several offers from Tamil and Telugu to direct Chanakyan. Kamal even wanted me to direct the Hindi version of Avai Shammughi. But I refused. My stand is that one has to pursue new themes and genres to challenge one's own creative boundaries.”Rajeev agrees that this has its own drawbacks and advantages. “Being associated with a certain kind of films helps pull in viewers who are drawn to that category of films. If the film lives up to their expectations, then you have made it. So each film has to pique their curiosity and keep them glued to the screen,” explains Rajeev. Therein lies the challenge for Rajeev the filmmaker who agrees that this sometimes translated into films that did not set the cash registers ringing.
Eclectic filmography
Thus his eclectic collection of films include Ottayal Pattalam, Mahanagaram, Pavithram, Kannezhuthi Pottum Thottu,' ‘
Sesham' ….And then Rajeev took over as Chairman of the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy in 2003. A decision that surprised many then. “It was not about the position but I wanted to see how one could best synergise cinema, the Government and the Academy. Plans to begin a touring talkies, to set up a permanent centre for cinema and so on were put into motion when I helmed the Academy. Decisions that are bearing fruit now. I see it as an educative period when I was able to test myself as an administrator and catalyst. It also gave me an opportunity to see and interact with world-class filmmakers and technicians.”In addition to films, Rajeev also went on to become a sought-after director for stage shows in India and abroad.However, Rajeev maintains that his first love has and will always be cinema. “My idol is Mrinal Sen. That is why I called my son Mrinal.”On being prodded to name his best works that he would want Mrinal and his daughter, Keerthana, to see, a little hesitantly, he says: Chanakyan, Pavithram, Kannezhuthi Pottum Thottu and Sesham.“I have to satisfy myself first and those are the films that met my own standards,” avers Rajeev.
Soundtrack

Rajeev tunes in to music when he is not thinking, talking and creating films. “I enjoy Carnatic music and my favourites are Maharajapuram and the Ambalappuzha Brothers. I also enjoy Western Symphonies a great deal.

  | Photo Credit: B_Velankanni Raj A host of reasons, including increased consumption and lack of enough power generation initiatives by the previous AIADMK government, was responsible the power crisis in the state, Law Minister Duraimurugan informed the state assembly today.While the peak demand was 11,000 mw, the peak availability was just 8,000 mw, Mr. Duraimurugan said, replying to the demand on the grants for Electricity Department in place of Arcot N. Veeraswamy.The government purchased 2,000 mw and had put in “restriction and control measures” (load shedding in areas other than Chennai and its suburbs) to manage the deficit of rest of the 1,000 mw, he said.He said while the AIADMK government announced a few power generation projects, none of them were “actually implemented.” ‘We have been taking care on power-generation projects and some of the ongoing ones including those in Chennai and Mettur will be completed by next year,” he said adding the state could become power-surplus by 2012 or 2013.He said the delay in production from Koodankulam nuclear power plant, a joint initiative with Russia and dip in production at Kalpakkam and Kaiga (Karnataka) power plants were adding to the state’s woes on power front. Besides, low water levels in dams had affected hydel power generation.He said by the month-end, windmills were expected to increase power generation, which could ease the situation, following which load shedding could be relaxed.Number of consumers had also increased from 1.78 crore in 2005-06 to 2.12 crore in 2009-10, he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Increased-consumption-among-reasons-cited-for-TN-power-crisis/article16299066.ece

(RNRL) of the Anil Ambani group for fixing the price of gas to be supplied to RNRL.Disposing of a batch of appeals, a Bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justices B. Sudershan Reddy and P. Sathasivam on Friday rejected RNRL's claim that it was entitled to get 28 mscmd of gas from the KG Basin at $2.34 mBtu in terms of a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Anil and Mukesh without any price approval by the government..In a separate judgment written by Justice Sathasivam and agreed to by the CJI, the Bench said that while initiating renegotiations “the parties should take into account the MoU [which], even though not legally binding, is a commitment which reflects the good interests of both parties.” This Bench expressed its dissent on some of the points dealt with by Justice Reddy in his separate judgment.Justice Reddy, while directing the parties to renegotiate, said the exercise should be dehors the MoU. Such renegotiations should be within the framework of governmental policy and approvals on price, quantity and tenure of supply of gas.Justice Sathasivam's judgment said: “It is not permissible for RIL to enter into a contract with RNRL to supply a fixed quantity as the gas continues to be the property of the government till the time it reaches the delivery point, and thus RIL has no right to dispose of the same without the express approval of the Union government.”On RNRL's contention that gas should be supplied without any governmental approval, the Bench said that having insisted on a Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) in conformity with the NTPC draft GSPA dated May 12, 2005 which contained an unequivocal stipulation of government approval for quantity, tenure and price, it was not open to the Anil group to argue that government approval for supply was not required.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Centres-gas-pricing-policy-will-prevail-rules-Supreme-Court/article16299180.ece

544,"Decision soon on caste-based census, Manmohan assures Lok Sabha",Vinay Kumar,2010-05-07,16:16:38 IST,"TV grab shows Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressing the Lok Sabha on Friday.
  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday assured the Lok Sabha that the government would soon take a decision on the Opposition demand for a caste-based census.“I am aware of the views of the Members of Parliament belonging to all sections. I assure you that the Cabinet will take a decision shortly,” Dr. Singh said in a brief statement.The statement put at ease agitated Opposition members, particularly Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh, Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad and Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav.The three leaders and other Opposition members were ruffled over Home Minister P. Chidambaram's reply to the debate on census. He said there were difficulties in conducting a caste-based census and the government would keep in mind the members' views.As soon as the Minister concluded his reply, which was punctuated by interruptions from the Opposition benches, and the House was adjourned to meet again at 2.30 p.m., the three leaders approached the Prime Minister, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee. They were seen talking to them, trying to elicit some kind of an assurance on their demand. They also held a meeting with Mr. Mukherjee separately, when BJP's deputy leader Gopinath Munde was also present.When Dr. Singh gave the assurance soon after the House reassembled, the three leaders thanked him and the Congress president for trying to resolve the matter in an amicable manner.
“A valuable guide”
Earlier, while taking note of the discussion over the last two days that witnessed arguments and reasons for canvassing the question of caste, Mr. Chidambaram said the government was seized of the matter. “The views of honourable members will certainly be a valuable guide to the government,” he said in his statement, which virtually gave out nothing but offered explanation relating to the Census 2011 and preparation of the National Population Register (NPR), the two exercises which are on. The debate on the issue saw members cutting across party lines favouring a caste-based census.Replying to the debate, the Home Minister stressed that the main aim of the exercise was headcount and listed difficulties in including caste in the list. The Registrar-General had pointed out a number of logistics and practical difficulties in canvassing the question of caste while conducting census. However, he assured the House that the government “will give due weight to all aspects of the issue.”“The enumerator is not an investigator or verifier,” Mr. Chidambaram said, pointing out that 21 lakh enumerators — mostly primary school teachers — had no training or expertise to classify the answer as OBC or otherwise.“There is a Central list of OBCs and State-specific lists of OBCs. Some States do not have a list of OBCs while some have a list of OBCs and a sub-set called Most Backward Castes,” he said.
Many issues
Quoting the Registrar-General, Mr. Chidambaram said issues regarding methodology, avoiding phonetic and spelling errors, stage of canvassing of caste, maintaining integrity of enumeration and doing an accurate headcount of population would arise.“The census is done under the authority of the Census Act, 1948. Census 2011 will be the 15th national census since 1872 and the 7th since Independence. Population census is the total process of collecting demographic, economic and social data. What is published as the census data are only aggregates; the information relating to the individual is confidential and not shared with anyone or any authority,” he said.While throwing up the question if the census was the vehicle to carry out caste-based enumeration, he pointed out that records showed that an attempt was made by the Ministry of Social Justice to include caste as one of the questions that should be canvassed in the 2001 Census. “However, the government of the day — the NDA government — did not take a decision to that effect and maintained the policy that has been in force since 1951,” Mr. Chidambaram said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Decision-soon-on-caste-based-census-Manmohan-assures-Lok-Sabha/article16299151.ece
545,DU violated rules by selling radioactive scrap: Govt.,PTI,2010-05-07,16:07:36 IST,"Under attack on the Mayapuri radiation accident, Government on Friday said Delhi University had violated rules by selling scrap containing radioactive material and that those responsible would not be spared.Minister of State Prithiviraj Chavan asserted that all the 19 nuclear plants generating electricity in the country were completely safe and mechanisms would be strengthened in the field of atomic research and medical use as “some lessons have been learnt” from the accident in which one person died.He told the Lok Sabha that Delhi Police had upgraded the FIR in the case after one person died and that it was looking at “criminal negligence” part in the radiation caused by Cobalt-60.Against the backdrop of the mishap in the West Delhi scrap market last month, he forcefully argued for the need to put in place a law on fixing compensation in the case of accidents involving radioactive leakages as there was a “void“.During the Calling Attention Motion, Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Gurudas Dasgupta, Sumitra Mahajan (BJP) and B. Mahtab and Arjun Charan Sethi (BJD) demanded that the university authorities be brought to book on charge of criminal negligence as, being “highly educated”, they ought to know the repercussions of auctioning the Gamma Cell as scrap.“Mistake was made by the (Delhi) University in not adhering” to rules and its own undertaking to atomic energy authorities that the device, which was used by its Chemistry Department, would not be re-sold, Mr. Chavan said replying to the Motion.He said the DU authorities “did not follow rules” and asserted that responsibility will be fixed. “No guilty person will be spared, I assure you,” Mr. Chavan told the House.The radioactive leakage occurred when a scrap, which originated from Delhi University’s Chemistry Department, was being cut at a shop.Responding to members’ concerns, the Minister said all the 112 cobalt slugs related to the accident have since been identified and sent to the Narora Nuclear Power Plant for safe keeping.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/DU-violated-rules-by-selling-radioactive-scrap-Govt./article16299044.ece
546,Nuclear liability Bill introduced amid Opposition protest,PTI,2010-05-07,14:33:13 IST,"The controversial Bill that provides for payment of compensation in the event of a nuclear accident was introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday amid protests and walkout by Opposition NDA and Left parties which termed it as “illegal” and “unconstitutional“.The Civil Liability For Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010, whose passage is a key requirement for operationalisation of the Indo-US nuclear deal, was moved by Minister of State in the PMO Prithviraj Chavan after a clash between ruling and opposition members.The bill provides for the maximum liability of Rs 500 crore on the part of the operator in the case of a nuclear accident, a provision that is the main cause of opposition by the NDA and Left parties.As Chavan sought permission to introduce the bill, CPI(M) members Basudeb Acharia and Ramchandra Dome, BJP leaders M M Joshi and Yashwant Sinha and CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said the proposed legislation would violate Article 21 of the Constitution, a fundamental right that guarantees right to life.They said the bill also compromises the right of victims to approach courts for enhanced compensation.Amid cries of “shame, shame” from BJP members, Mr. Sinha alleged that the proposed legislation was being introduced under the U.S. pressure.Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj said her party had conveyed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the bill should be amended but the government was “adamant” on introducing it in the present form.Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, along with Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, argued that the members could not speak on the merits of the bill at the introduction stage and could only talk about legislative competence of the House on taking up the proposed legislation.Significantly, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD leader Lalu Prasad, who had opposed the bill in March when the first attempt was made to introduce it, this time appeared to be siding with the government.Mr. Yadav, who along with Mr. Prasad met Mr. Mukherjee last evening, was even seen apparently trying to convince Mr. Acharia about the bill.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Nuclear-liability-Bill-introduced-amid-Opposition-protest/article16299036.ece

Advani explained to Ms. Patil the gist of the memorandum and why the MPs felt it necessary to complain to her about the “misuse” of CBI by the government.Later, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj told reporters, “Our main point was that CBI should remain impartial in its investigations. It has become a weapon in the hands of the Congress.”Ms. Swaraj enumerated cases against Congress leaders like Satish Sharma, Bofors pay-off accused Ottavio Quattrochi, and more recently the disproportionate assets cases against SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, RJD president Lalu Prasad and BSP supremo Mayawati in which CBI allegedly went slow or played a partisan role.However, the cases against Mr. Advani and Mr. Murli Manohar Joshi were expedited, she alleged.“We have also been in power but never misused the CBI. It has become the working style of the Congress to get a clean chit from CBI to their leaders, corner opposition leaders and dangle it like a Damocles’ Sword in front of those leaders who fall in between to get their support,” Ms. Swaraj said.The BJP leader insisted that the Congress-led government was misusing the CBI in the Sohrabuddin encounter case by arresting several police officers, which was “demoralising” the State police.She also questioned the timing of the arrests and said it was done when the Swarnim Gujarat (marking 50 years of formation of the State) celebrations were on, to embarrass the Narendra Modi government.BJP also sought a discussion in Parliament on the alleged misuse of CBI.“We will now raise this issue during the Monsoon session of Parliament as this session is getting over today,” Ms. Swaraj said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/BJP-leaders-submit-memorandum-on-lsquomisusersquo-of-CBI-to-President/article16299022.ece

We told them (Americans) our fear, even though US is giving equipment to Pakistan to fight against Taliban, we feel there is every possibility of (Pakistan) diverting most of them to the Indian borders.

551,"Fix accountability for sabotaging AI merger, say unions",PTI,2010-05-07,11:01:12 IST,"In this file photo,a man walks in the backdrop of a parked Air India plane at the airport in New Delhi. AP.
  A group of Air India unions today asked Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel to fix the accountability on those who are “sabotaging” the airlines merger process and have led to a loss of Rs. 18,000 crores in the last three years.Common Action Group (CAG), a group of unions of Air India—NACIL who have joined hands to save the national carrier, said that “accountability be fixed on those persons for sabotaging the merger process, propagating the rhetoric of de—merger and causing losses to the tune of Rs. 18,000 crores.”The CAG, in a statement, alleged that some anti—Air India (NACIL) lobbies comprised well—established people opposed to the merger of AI and Indian Airlines. The merger took place in 2007.“In a bid to keep alive the very ‘division’ of both the companies, they propagated that the merger was a futile exercise and that eventually there would be a ‘de—merger’Following this, the integration went haywire — the process which would have been done in the first three months — could not be completed in three years,” they said.The group claimed that some officials created divisions among the union by “consistently misusing their official positions and by giving recognition to splintered minority groups in the unions as against pro—merger majorities, they sabotaged the merger badly“.“Initially, the consulting company informed that the airline would benefit around Rs. 832 crores by operational synergies alone in the first three months but even operational integration could not place and the company lost Rs. 7,200 crores in the first year, Rs. 5000 crores in the second year and the third year Rs. 5,400 crores. The cost of sabotaging the merger has caused the company a whopping Rs. 18,000 crores so far,” CAG said.The group warned that if the rhetoric of ‘de—merger’ was allowed to be propagated it would lead to a loss of Rs. 36,000 crores.Eleven recognised Air India employees unions are today holding a conference in a bid to save the airline which would be addressed by CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury and Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam.The CAG also attributed frequent change of CMDs in the last three years as a contributing factor which allowed the anti—merger conspiracy to deepen further.

Krishna while replying to supplementary questions in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.Without naming Pakistan, he said the nature of development “is only the vindication of what India has been conveying to the United States government that the epicentre of all terrorists activities comes from only one country.''He was responding to a question from Prakash Javdekar (BJP) whether India would draw the attention of the U.S. of New Delhi's concern over terror emanating from Islamabad in the light of the last week's incident. Authorities in New York arrested Pakistan born U.S. citizen Faisal Shahzad for leaving a vehicle behind in the Times Square to explode.The Minister said the incident strengthened India's assessment that the U.S. would understand the reality that a terror attack could emanate from anywhere and strike at any place.To questions on India's stand on the U.S. plan to supply drones to Pakistan, the Minister said New Delhi had recounted its past experience and cautioned Washington to constantly monitor how the military equipment supplied to Islamabad was being used.Mr. Krishna said whenever there were high-level exchanges between India and the U.S. “we invariably point out our experience in the past and then the possibility of the lurking dangers'' over India's head.The U.S. had promised it was closely monitoring how military aid given to Pakistan is being used and New Delhi's concerns would be kept in mind.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lsquoFaisal-arrest-in-United-States-vindicates-Indias-stand/article16298989.ece

Besides a GJM delegation, officials of the Union Home Ministry and the West Bengal government will be attending.The talks are being viewed as precursor to another round of political level discussions slated for later in the month.Though the West Bengal government is amenable to the idea of an alternative administrative set-up with greater powers than what the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) was invested with it is opposed to the jurisdiction of such a body extending beyond the three hill-subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong. It also favours constitutional status to such a set-up.The issue of jurisdiction is of greater importance to the GJM leadership presently than the powers it demands for the interim set-up, GJM sources said.While the West Bengal government has ruled out any bifurcation of the State for the creation of a separate “Gorkhaland,” State regional parties in the Darjeeling hills like the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League and the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists have been increasingly strident in their criticism of the GJM.According to them, it is allegedly settling for a “regional authority” rather than pursuing its professed agenda for a separate State.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/GJM-threatens-agitation/article16298975.ece
555,Political parties double efforts to woo Thakurs in Uttar Pradesh,Atiq Khan,2010-05-07,02:34:07 IST,"Political parties in Uttar Pradesh have doubled their efforts to woo the Thakurs or the Kshatriyas, who constitute roughly about three to four per cent of the electorate and are considered to be the “floating vote.”Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has taken the lead in this regard by constituting a three-member committee, comprising three Thakur Ministers — Vinod Singh, Badshah Singh and Jaiveer Singh, to enlist the support of their kinsmen for the BSP.Not to be left behind, several senior Thakur leaders in the Congress are expected to be present at the Maharana Pratap birth anniversary celebrations in Lucknow on May 9. While the former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and the All-India Congress Committee general-secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, is the chief guest, Sultanpur MP Sanjay Singh has been designated as chairman of the gathering. Banda MLA Vivek Singh and former party MP from Azamgarh Santosh Singh are other invitees.The Rajputana warrior-king's birth anniversary celebration is being organised by the Maharana Pratap Jayanti Aayojan Samiti. The samiti had invited the former Bharatiya Janata Party president, Rajnath Singh, as the chief guest when he was the Chief Minister in 2001.On Mr. Digvijay Singh being chosen as chief guest, convenor Vakil Singh said: “The samaj (community) wanted Mr. Digvijay Singh as the chief guest at the warrior-king's birth anniversary celebrations this year.” He denied that the committee was a political forum, though sources in the Pradesh Congress Committee said there was nothing wrong in wooing the Kshatriyas.Unlike other caste components of the State's electorate, chiefly the Brahmins and Muslims, the Thakur vote is scattered. It is in the Avadh region, synonymous with the erstwhile principalities, the rajas and maharajas, and the landed gentry, where the Thakurs have an established presence.According to rough estimates, there are almost 40 to 50 Assembly seats where the Thakur vote may prove to be crucial.The Samajwadi Party was in the reckoning for the Thakur-support till former general-secretary Amar Singh was expelled by party president Mulayam Singh.Since then, Mr. Amar Singh has formed the Lok Manch, which he claims, is a apolitical organisation.He is touring different parts of the State to muster the support of the Kshatriyas, Muslims and the Most Backward Classes.In the recent past, the former SP general-secretary was the chief guest at several functions organised by groups claiming to represent the Kshatriyas.SP sources said Mr. Mulayam Singh is unsure of Thakur support as a long-term political option.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Political-parties-double-efforts-to-woo-Thakurs-in-Uttar-Pradesh/article16298968.ece

558,"Centre misusing CBI to defame Modi, says BJP",Neena Vyas,2010-05-07,02:27:28 IST,"For the first time since the Supreme Court decided to get to the bottom of the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, the Bharatiya Janata Party has come to the defence of Chief Minister Narendra Modi.It described Sohrabuddin as one who was “spreading terror” and associated with the “Dawood and Latif” gang of criminals.After the “encounter” was staged in 2005, the “story” given by the Gujarat police was that Sohrabuddin was out to kill Mr. Modi and that his plan was foiled after he was killed in an encounter.Apparently, it was at a meeting at senior BJP leader L.K. Advani's residence early in May that Mr. Modi asked partymen to focus on the Central Bureau of Investigation rather than go on talking about the prices of dal and wheat.The BJP decided to hit out at the United Progressive Alliance government for its alleged misuse of the CBI ahead of the voting on the cut motion in the Lok Sabha, but it would seem that the larger intent was to defend Mr. Modi. The cut motion was defeated on April 27, and the next day the CBI arrested senior Gujarat IPS officer Abhay Chudasma in the Sohrabuddin case.The BJP said the UPA had used the CBI to arm-twist leaders of the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal into deserting the Opposition-sponsored cut motion. The first to make this charge was Arun Jaitley, who issued a statement to this effect on April 27, but he did not mention the Gujarat cases.Following the cut motion vote, the allegation was repeated by several party leaders including Sushma Swaraj and Gopinath Munde. It was about the same time that Mr. Chudasma was arrested, setting off alarm bells in the party.On Thursday, the party leaders, led by Mr. Advani, sat in dharna in the Parliament House complex to protest the “misuse of the CBI.” Separately party president Nitin Gadkari issued, from Goa, a three-and-a-half page statement on the subject, of which nearly two pages were devoted to defending the Modi government's record.His case was that there had been many more encounter deaths in other States — Uttar Pradesh headed the list — but the UPA was going after the Modi government.“The CBI is being misused to suppress [the truth] and defame the Chief Minister.

560,Call for Asia-Pacific nations to invest more in social sector,Aarti Dhar,2010-05-07,02:13:06 IST,"A United Nations report has called upon governments in the Asia-Pacific region to increase social spending to consolidate the region's stronger than anticipated economic rebound and to spur over the long term a fairer, more balanced, and sustained economic recovery.The Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2010, an annual publication of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) released globally on Thursday provides the governments of the region — representing 62 per cent of the world's population — a roadmap towards a more inclusive and sustainable development path.According to the survey, even at the height of this crisis, Asia-Pacific was still the fastest-growing region, supported in large part by fiscal stimulus packages adopted by the region's biggest economies.The report finds the outlook for 2010 has improved significantly, with the region's developing economies forecast to grow by 7 per cent, led by China (9.5) and India (8.3).However, rising inflationary pressures, especially of food products, and asset price bubbles, in a number of countries make 2010 a complex year for policy makers who will have to balance the momentum of growth with financial stability. While monetary tightening may be necessary to restrain inflationary pressures, policy makers must be cautious about withdrawing fiscal stimulus packages lest the fledgling recovery process is disrupted, it said.It also recommends the use of capital controls to moderate short-term capital inflows — the result of a massive expansion of liquidity in western countries —which has created asset bubbles, inflationary pressures and exchange rate increases in the region's developing economies.A sustained, long term development for all economies within the region will have to rely on creating new engines of growth, with greater regional consumption through increased intra-regional trade, and accelerating the development of an Asia-Pacific consumer market.Increased social spending directly supports income security for households by providing food security, education and access to health care, reducing the need by poorer families to maintain precautionary savings to protect against adversity. These families are then able to contribute more to local economies and invest more in their own development, it suggests.Also, as the majority of the region's poor lives in rural areas deriving benefit from agricultural growth, the survey recommends continued support for crop and rural development, urging a new, knowledge-intensive Green Revolution to make agriculture more environmentally resilient. Countries can also increase the development value of the agricultural sector by making it more socially inclusive: returning ownership of land and resources to farmers, especially women, and economically empowering the poor.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Call-for-Asia-Pacific-nations-to-invest-more-in-social-sector/article16298948.ece
561,Separate facility in trains to transport undertrials?,K. Balchand,2010-05-07,02:07:11 IST,"Will the Railways soon have a separate facility for transporting undertrials?Whether or not that happens is a moot point, but the Railway Board is seized with the matter after the collision of two trains in October, when an undertrial pulled the chain in a bid to escape and another train rammed into the halted train from behind.The authorities brought up the issue at the recently held meeting of zonal general managers. According to sources, Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee has just about given her nod to the board to probe options to transport undertrials more safely so as not to cause any hardship to passengers or disrupt the movement of trains.The choice is a tough one, as providing such a facility in all trains would entail heavy cost, besides eating into space that can otherwise be utilised commercially. The authorities are presently contemplating segregating undertrials altogether to prevent them from getting access to the emergency chain or coming in contact with passengers.The authorities, however, are clear that the undertrial could not be held responsible for the October 21 accident. On the day, the Goa Express rammed into the Mewar Express near Mathura, killing 22 persons. The undertrial was being transported in the Mewar Express.Railway officials concede that his action could not be taken as an excuse for the accident, as any train can be brought to a halt for any number of reasons, including a genuine emergency.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Separate-facility-in-trains-to-transport-undertrials/article16298944.ece
562,"Nothing unconstitutional about MPLAD scheme, rules Supreme Court",J. Venkatesan,2010-05-07,02:02:24 IST,"The Supreme Court on Thursday held that the Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme, under which every MP is allotted Rs. 2 crore a year for constituency development, was intra vires the Constitution.“A mere allegation of misuse of the funds by some MPs in itself may not be a ground for scrapping of the scheme as checks and safeguards have been provided,” said a Constitution Bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justices R.V. Raveendran, D.K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and J.M. Panchal.Writing the judgment, Justice Sathasivam said: “The information furnished shows that the scheme has benefited the local community by meeting its various developmental needs such as drinking water facility, education, electricity, health and family welfare, irrigation, non-conventional energy, community centres, public libraries, bus stands, roads, pathways, bridges and sports infrastructure. Parliament has the power to enquire and take appropriate action against erring members. Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha have set up standing committees to monitor the works.”On the contention that spending of monies on various projects had to be separately provided for by law, the Bench said: “If the Union government intends to spend money for a public purpose and for implementing various welfare schemes, the same is permitted by presenting an Appropriation Bill, which is a Money Bill, and by laying the same before the Houses and after getting the approval of Parliament, the Lok Sabha, in particular, it becomes law and there cannot be any impediment to implementing the same so long as the scheme is for the public purpose.”The Bench said: “Clearly, the MPLAD scheme does not give carte blanche to the MPs with respect to the kind of works they can recommend. The scheme falls within the meaning of ‘public purpose' aimed at fulfilment of the development and welfare of the State as reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy. ‘Laws' mentioned in Article 282 would also include Appropriation Acts. A specific or special law need not be enacted by Parliament to resort to the provision. Thus, the MPLAD Scheme is valid as Appropriation Acts have been duly passed year after year.”The Bench said: “Even though MPs have been given a seemingly executive function, their role is limited to ‘recommending' works and the actual implementation is done by local authorities. There is no removal of checks and balances since these are duly provided and have to be strictly adhered to under the guidelines of the scheme and Parliament. Therefore, the scheme does not violate separation of powers.”Further, “panchayat raj institutions, municipal as well as local bodies have not been denuded of their role or jurisdiction as due place has been accorded to them by the guidelines in the implementation of the scheme.”The Bench said: “The court can strike down a law or scheme only on the basis of its vires or unconstitutionality but not on the basis of its viability. When a regime of accountability is available in the scheme, it is not proper for the court to strike it down, unless it violates any constitutional principle.In the present IMLAD Scheme, an accountability regime has been provided. Efforts must be made to make the regime more robust, but in its current form, it cannot be struck down as unconstitutional. The scheme does not result in an unfair advantage to the sitting members of Parliament and does not amount to a corrupt practice.”The Bench dismissed all writ petitions filed by Bhim Singh and others as well as transferred cases.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Nothing-unconstitutional-about-MPLAD-scheme-rules-Supreme-Court/article16121962.ece

(Rs.1.88 crore).According to an official statement here, revival/closure of these companies is yet to be finalised, except in the case of HMT Bearing Ltd. where the revival plan already approved could not materialise. “Therefore, it was considered essential that the interim financial support from the government be provided so that the operations of the companies may not be affected.

Union Minister of State for Water Resources Vincent Pala said this in a written reply in Rajya Sabha.The NCA, chaired by the Union Water Resources Secretary, gave instructions in 2008 that the next stage of construction at the dam would first be considered in the Environment and Rehabilitation and Resettlement sub-groups, after consultation with the Grievances Redressal Authorities set up in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.So far, the environment sub-group had “conditionally permitted” construction of the spillway piers to its full height and the installation of gates (to be kept in raised position). Approval from the Rehabilitation and Resettlement sub-group is yet to be obtained, the Minister added.In its order on a writ petition filed by the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), the Supreme Court said in 2000 that the NCA would give permission to raise the height of the dam from time to time “after” it obtains “clearances” from the Rehabilitation and Resettlement sub-group (including consultation with the three Grievance Redressal Authorities of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra) and the environment sub-group.

565,Court calls for Chhattisgarh report on NHRC findings,J. Venkatesan,2010-05-07,01:59:14 IST,"The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to send a team of rights activists, at this stage, to Chhattisgarh to look into complaints of rights violations. Instead, it directed the State government to submit a report on the action taken on the findings of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).A Bench comprising Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justices Deepak Verma and B.C. Chauhan said: “As regards the implementation of the NHRC Report, the government is directed to file a detailed report as to what steps have so far been taken regarding the registration of various criminal cases and the progress made in the various criminal cases which are already pending in courts.”The Bench said: “The State would also respond to the suggestions made by the petitioner [Nandini Sundar] as to whether a committee could be appointed to consider the question of rehabilitation and compensation, if any, to be paid to the victims. The State shall file its response within four weeks.”When the petitioner referred to the rights violations and drew the court's attention to the plight of the people, the CJI observed: “We agree with your concern for the ordinary people in Dantewada district.”The CJI referred to the statements made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P. Chidambaram on the ongoing fight against Naxalites in the country's tribal belt. “Your PM and HM have said it's war. Is it not war?” “Who will protect them there? The government could not even take care of its own people [referring to the April 6 Naxal attack on CRPF jawans]. If something happens who will take care?”The CJI, expressing concern over the plight of the people caught in the conflict, said: “There are no schools, no primary health centres, no roads, the people are suffering. Such are the conditions.”He rejected the demand for setting up of a committee to oversee registration of police complaints, saying it was violative of the principles of criminal justice. “Criminal prosecution is not something that can be interfered with.”Ms. Nandini said that as the State government had failed to address the issues raised by an NHRC team, the court should depute a team of rights activists or independent eminent people such as the former Election Commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh, to visit those areas. “The constitution of a monitoring committee can lead to a de-escalation of conflict. It could act as a confidence-building measure. It could invite complaints (of excesses) from people and hold out an assurance of peace to the people.”The government had so far inquired into only 22 of the 114 instances of rights violations noted by the NHRC and filed FIRs on seven of them, the petitioner said.Her counsel Rajinder Sachar argued that the government had not compensated all those affected by the conflict.In her rehabilitation proposal, Ms. Nandini wanted that all affected and displaced persons given immediate humanitarian assistance, “wherever they are. In particular, they have the right to food, shelter, healthcare (including mental health care), clothing and education. There should, at the same time, be a time frame for full and voluntary return of all displaced persons in conflict situations.”The government, on its part, said “police forces” had been “blown up and their legs amputated” when they went to find out people reported missing by activists. Its counsel, Manish Singhvi, said: “The State is committed to providing compensation to all affected by violence committed by any outfit.”The matter will come up for further hearing in July.
Correction

In a report “[Supreme] Court calls for NHRC report on Chhattisgarh” (May 7, 2010), the petitioner, Nandini Sundar did not ask for the court “to send a team of rights activists to Chhattisgarh to look into complaints of rights violations” as was reported in the first paragraph. As part of the rehabilitation plan, the petitioner wanted a high level monitoring committee which would include retired civil servants or judges as well as representatives of the Government of Chhattisgarh; a survey to be carried out under the aegis of a reputed academic institution, and district judges to receive and process claims of heinous crimes.

Venkatesan,2010-05-07,01:52:55 IST,"The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would examine the validity of the constitution of the Tandon Committee set up by the Human Resource Development Ministry to go into the working of the deemed universities in the country.The Professor Tandon Committee had earlier recommended de-recognition of 44 institutions for failing to meet the prescribed standards and said that these institutions after de-recognition would be affiliated to the respective State universities.During the resumed hearing on Thursday, Justice Bhandari heading a Bench told Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam that when there were allegations against Professor Tandon himself that he was heading a deemed university and it was not appropriate for him to head the Committee, “we have to examine the whole issue.”Justice Gyan Sudha Misra was the other judge on the Bench.Assailing the setting up of the committee, petitioners had contended that the deemed varsity status could be withdrawn only pursuant to a power statutorily conferred authorising such withdrawal and in accordance with statutory regulations. The right conferred on these universities could not be restricted by executive directions issued on the whims and fancy of the government.It was pointed out that each of the 126 deemed universities was given only 10 minutes to give a presentation before the committee about their institution and the committee had determined its conclusions on nine parameters in these 10 minutes.“It is absolutely absurd that the fate of a university with thousands of students and staff and investments in crores of rupees can be concluded in such a hurried and inadequate manner.”Pointing out that the entire constitution of the committee was vitiated, the petitioners sought a declaration that the committee was without authority and its report was illegal and unenforceable. The Bench asked the government and the parties concerned to complete the pleadings and directed the matter to be listed for final hearing on August 3.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Supreme-Court-to-examine-validity-of-Tandon-committee/article16298936.ece

  Four miners were killed and 28 injured in a massive blast in the Anjan Hills coalmine in Chhattisgarh's Koriya district on Thursday.Six members of a technical team were still trapped in the mine, and rescue workers were unable to make contact with them. The mine, operated by South Eastern Coalfields Limited, an undertaking of the Coal Authority of India, is located 50 km from Chirmirri, district headquarters.“Of the 28 injured, 14 are being treated in the district hospital at Chirmirri, while 14 have been shifted to the Apollo Hospital at Bilaspur,” Collector Alok Awasthi said. “S.K.

In the morning, a rescue team and a technical team entered the mine for a safety check.However, they were trapped in the explosion that spewed scalding fumes to the surface.“Thirty-two miners standing at the mouth of the mine were injured,” Mr. Awasthi said, “While two died in the hospital in Chirmirri, two died en route to Bilaspur.”Rescue teams were waiting for conditions in the mine to stabilise before launching a search for survivors.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4-killed-in-Chhattisgarh-mine-explosion/article16298934.ece
568,JPC probe sought into 2G spectrum issue,Aarti DharK. V. Prasad,2010-05-07,01:46:55 IST,"AIADMK members disrupting Lok Sabha proceedings on the 2G spectrum allocation controversy, in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.
  The 2G spectrum allocation controversy figured in both Houses of Parliament with the AIADMK members, supported by the BJP, demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the issue. They also demanded a statement from the government on the matter.In the Lok Sabha, AIADMK member M. Thambidurai asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take the issue seriously and order a JPC probe. He said Telecom Minister A. Raja should be “kept out of the Ministry'' till a JPC probe is held and the ongoing investigation by the CBI is completed.Mr. Thambidurai pointed out that the Leader of the House and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was present, had promised that the government would respond to various issues raised by the Opposition, including 2G spectrum allocation. Mr. Thambidurai was supported in his demand by BJP members.He alleged that the country had lost Rs. 1 lakh crore in the allocation of 2G spectrum during 2007-08. This led to a clash between members of the AIADMK, supported by the BJP, and the DMK.Mr. Thambidurai said the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had noted that Rs. 26,000 crore had been lost “because of wrong-doing by this [Telecom] Ministry.” He said even the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) had pointed out that Raja's policy of giving 2G spectrum on ‘first-come-first-served' basis resulted in allocation at cheap rates which was “not acceptable.”On the CVC's order, the CBI lodged an FIR under Section 120 (B) of the Cr.PC and under the Prevention of Corruption Act, Mr. Thambidurai said, adding that the CBI had subsequently raided some “benami companies.''DMK leader T.R. Baalu, who repeatedly interrupted Mr. Thambidurai, insisted that no allegations should be levelled against the Minister against whom no case has been lodged.Speaker Meira Kumar assured Mr. Baalu that she would go through the records and expunge anything objectionable. In the ensuing melee, Ms. Kumar adjourned the House for an hour.In the Rajya Sabha, the AIADMK members forced a brief adjournment before staging a walkout demanding Mr. Raja's dismissal from the Union Cabinet.As soon as the House met for the day, the AIADMK members displayed CDs and newspapers carrying purported taped conversation with Mr. Raja and public relations lobbyist Nira Radia. Chairman Hamid Ansari asked members not to show CDs or display newspapers before adjourning the House for 10 minutes. Post-adjournment the AIADMK members again raised the issue before staging a walkout.Earlier, when the Lok Sabha assembled in the morning, the BJP tendered unconditional apology for alleged remarks of its member Ananth Kumar in the Lok Sabha against Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Prasad during the Census 2011 debate.As soon as the House met for the day, Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj said: “I unconditionally apologise for the remarks made by Ananth Kumar yesterday [Wednesday.]'' When Mr. Prasad sought to intervene, Ms. Swaraj said in a lighter vein that she apologised on behalf of Mr. Prasad also.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/JPC-probe-sought-into-2G-spectrum-issue/article16298952.ece

But a defiant Muivah said he would visit his village.The NSCN(IM) has been demanding the formation of a ‘greater Nagaland' by merging Naga-populated areas of adjoining States, but the plea has been rejected by the Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh governments.The Naga leader said he failed to understand why the Manipur government was objecting to his visit when the Centre had given its nod. On the Manipur government clamping prohibitory orders to prevent his entry, he said Nagas must resist its “nefarious designs“.On the ongoing talks, Mr. Muivah said both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P. Chidambaram had expressed their commitment to resolve the Naga issue peacefully.Noting that the complex Naga problem might not be resolved in one-go, he advocated a step-by-step solution.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, who flew to Delhi on Thursday morning to brief the Prime Minister and the Home Minister on the situation in Manipur, returned here in the afternoon.Late Wednesday night, four Naga organisations —— Naga Hoho, NSF, NPMHR and NMA —— appealed to Mr. Muivah to postpone his visit by a few days to “facilitate proper arrangements“.Civil society, in a joint statement, said: “This visit should be a memorable and meaningful one, and we feel your life and service that you have are very important to us and the Nagas.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/At-NGOs-instance-Muivah-puts-off-visit-to-ancestral-village/article16298912.ece

576,Scientists urged to help mango farmers,Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,02:47:54 IST,"Andhra Pradesh Horticulture University Vice-Chancellor S.D. Sikhamani called upon scientists to integrate their scientific results with the experiences of farmers and offer better solutions in making the mango produce best suitable for international markets.Addressing a ‘Brain Storming Session on Mango' held at Sangareddy on Thursday, Dr. Sikhamani said, “There is no correlation between research being conducted in the universities and the problems being faced by the farmers. We are failing to address their problems and as a result farmers are thinking of cutting down their mango trees.”Stressing on the integration between scientific research and farmers' experiences at field level, Dr. Sikhamani said that scientific research could only address their problems in the next three years.This collaboration, he stressed, was important for increasing mango exports. He also expressed serious concern over extending of seasons every year which had been adversely affecting the agricultural produce.Collector S. Suresh Kumar said the general feeling among farmers was that they were being ignored by scientists. Only a few progressive farmers were able to adopt new technologies. “Why can't mango farmers in Andhra Pradesh compete internationally when rubber farmers in Kerala are able to?” he asked adding that there was a need to promote different varieties of mangoes in the international market.The session had discussions on various issues pertaining to mango production and the problems being faced by farmers.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Scientists-urged-to-help-mango-farmers/article16298983.ece
577,Arjitha Seva tickets scam rocks TTD,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,02:45:27 IST,"Even as the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTS) is grappling with the legal battle over the controversial ‘Anantha Swarnamayam' project, yet another row has surfaced in the form of a major scam in the sale of the prime Arjitha Seva tickets (paid sevas), allegedly involving some ‘insiders'.While the TTD's vigilance authorities have been on a discreet probe into the scandal on the basis of prima facie evidence confirming the operation of a racket in the sale of Arjitha Seva tickets, especially the sought-after ‘Vasthralankara' ticket, what touched off a furore was reports in the vernacular print and electronic media which eventually caught the attention of Chief Minister K. Rosaiah.Apparently shocked over the magnitude of the scam, the Chief Minister spoke to TTD Executive Officer I.Y.R. Krishna Rao over phone on Thursday to get a first hand report on the operation of the well-entrenched racket which according to preliminary reports involved a sum of Rs.125 crore. Besides asking the E.O. to expedite the probe and bring to book all those involved, Mr. Rosaiah also suggested certain guidelines which were to be strictly followed with ‘immediate effect' in the sale of Arjitha Seva tickets.“We are immediately enforcing all the prescriptions of the Chief Minister,” said Mr. Krishna Rao at a hurriedly convened press conference on today to explain the fire-fighting measures being initiated by the TTD to rationalise the sale of prime tickets and also to go on the trail of the scamsters.According to preliminary investigations, the modus operandi of the racket, comprising influential middlemen, politicians, representatives of some leading industrial houses besides some TTD ‘insiders' had been to buy tickets on benami names of all the prime sevas such as Vasthralankara Seva, Abhishekam, Thomala, Archana, Suprabhatham etc from out of the 50 per cent ‘discretionary quota' earmarked for VVIPs, using their clout with the powers that be in the TTD, allegedly on a quid pro quo basis.The worst-hit was the sale of Friday ‘Vasthram' tickets whose price was only Rs.12,500 if officially booked in advance (it is already booked up to the year 2032) and Rs. 50,000 if officially sold out of the ‘discretionary quota'. This was said to be the breeding source for the scam.Reports said the price of the ticket secured under ‘discretionary quota' used to go as high as Rs.1.25 lakh to Rs.1.5 lakh depending on the demand and the ‘soundness' of the ‘party'. Same was the case with other tickets.The EO said as pointed out by the Chief Minister, the TTD would henceforth insist on production of photo ID card by the ticket holders for all the Arjitha Sevas including ‘Abhishekam' so that ‘proxy' system was curbed.As another measure, each devotee would be issued the prime Vasthram ticket only once a year and tickets already booked by the same devotee more than once in a year would be cancelled immediately.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Arjitha-Seva-tickets-scam-rocks-TTD/article16298981.ece

Association representatives, who interacted with the committee headed by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, explained how Telangana literature or writers from the region did not find a mention in the text books published by the government.They also alleged that the region has not got its due share of exposure in the cultural and literary fields, while pioneers of Telangana region including poets and writers have been discriminated by Andhra and Rayalaseema leaders. The language used in the textbooks was devoid of the Telangana flavour and students from the region were put to hardship in learning a form of Telugu which was ‘alien' to them. On the cultural front, Telangana dialect had been made a language of villains and jokers in films and the people of the region were forced to face derogatory remarks about their language by ‘pundits from seemaandhra'.Association convenor S. Narayana Reddy and others told reporters later that the committee was told how Telugu secured classical language status on the basis of excavations in Kotilingala in Karimnagar district and how people from other regions were taking credit for it.When the neglect of Urdu was brought to the notice of the panel, the committee members reportedly asked why the representations from the Muslim community were relatively low.

This is almost 10 percentage points lower than last year's figure of 72.84.The district's performance is dismal compared to neighbouring Mandya, which has been ranked 3rd in the State and Chamarajanagar, though ranked 20, has performed better than Mysore.Attributing the slide to the shortage of teachers, Deputy Director of Public Instruction Nagendra Kumar said the department had started recruiting teachers to the 272 vacancies in the district. Emphasis would be laid on improving the pass percentage, with teachers focussing on the new question paper pattern so students would be familiar with it before the examination, he said.While 22 schools secured cent per cent results, six schools in the district recorded zero pass percentage. Girls, as usual, outperformed boys. Among the 22, are three government schools, including the Government School for the Deaf and Blind.Students in Mysore city fared relatively better than their rural counterparts, with Mysore South taluk topping the list with a pass percentage of 72.32. The performance of other taluks is as follows: T. Narsipur (67.35); K.R. Nagar (54); Nanjangud (56.10); Mysore North (64.63); H.D. Kote (51.27) and Periyapatana (62.27 per cent).Among the schools in Mysore Sri Ramakrishna Vidyashala continued its tradition of securing cent per cent results; of the 98 students who appeared for the examination, 62 passed with distinction and the rest with first class.

The recommendations of the committee could be implemented in July,” he said.Mr. Zalki said the policy is based on the 10 guiding principles of the International Labour Organisation's Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and World of Work.“Due to the social culture here, people, even those who use contraceptives, are not open about it. Even purchasing contraceptives from medical stores is done with some hesitation and awkwardness,” he said.

Then, they requested Deputy Commissioner B. Shivappa to taste the food .Police officers, presspersons and members of the public also tasted the food and concurred with the protesters. .The protesters had gathered under the banner of the Bellary district unit of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers and Assistants' Federation, affiliated to the All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).The stir was part of a Statewide agitation called by AITUC.Arkaani, president of the district unit of the federation, told The Hindu that the Government had brought in changes to the food kit supplied under the three-decade-old programme. As a result, the kit contained powdered grain with oil mixed in it, instead of foodgrains, she noted.Ms. Arkaani suspected that either the contents in the packets had become old or sub-standard grain could have been used by the agencies that had been awarded the contract, resulting in the contents turning bad.“Children and pregnant women have been rejecting the food served to them in the anganwadi centres,” she said. This had defeated the very purpose of the Government programme, she added.In a memorandum submitted to the Governor and Chief Minister, the anganwadi workers urged the authorities to stop the supply of ready-to-eat food and restore the earlier system of supplying foodgrains. If this was not done, the beneficiaries might stop coming to the anganwadi centres, resulting in the closing down of all centres and rendering 1.08 lakh workers and assistants jobless, they warned.General secretary of the district unit of the Communist Party of India K.

  The Indian science community has for long contended with one discomfiting statistic: a staggering 60 per cent of women with Ph.Ds in science do not make it to research positions in science institutes.The reason, as conventional perception had it, was that women scientists were overwhelmed by family responsibilities, particularly after childbirth, and pressured to drop out of research.But a new study presents a different picture of the Indian woman scientist — as someone with formidable tenacity and ambition, who ensures she balances career and family, working longer hours than her male counterpart, and proactive about keeping herself updated.The proverbial “glass ceiling” that cuts short women's careers in science comes not from family, but largely from a systemic bias at the institutional level, finds the report titled “Trained scientific women power: How much are we losing and why?” co-authored by Anitha Kurup, Associate Professor; Maithreyi R., Research Associate at the National Institute of Advanced Studies; and Rohini Godbole, Professor at the Indian Institute of Science and Chair of the ‘Women in Science' panel of the Indian Academy of Sciences.The three-year-long project created a database of 1,985 women with a Ph.D. in science, engineering or medicine in the 30 to 60 age group. The survey covered 568 women scientists and 161 men scientists in research. The women were divided into three categories: those engaged in research; those in undergraduate teaching, managerial or temporary research posts; and women scientists presently not working.The majority of unemployed women Ph.Ds said they “did not get jobs” (66.7 per cent). “Family reasons” was cited by only 3.3 per cent as the main reason for not working. This lack of job opportunity underlines the need for transparency in the selection procedure at institutions, and also the importance of gender audits, says the report. A mandatory — and publicly displayed — gender break-up of staff, faculty and students would aid the process of increasing recruitment of women in science, it adds.As many as 85 per cent of all women said they successfully balanced work and family, many of them choosing to negotiate “winding career paths” in an attempt to stay on the research track after childbirth. Interestingly, 13 per cent of women in research had chosen to remain single, compared to just three per cent of their male counterparts.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lsquoWomen-scientists-face-systemic-biases/article16298901.ece

However, the parents of the student have refused to accept the suspension and have threatened to move court if the principal was not sacked.Believers' Church Kerala secretary Fr. Williams informed the decision to suspend the principal at a meeting convened to sort out the issue here on Friday by District Collector P. Venugopal. Fr. Williams said the church authorities did not know about the issue of the transfer certificate and that they were not informed about it at any stage. The principal's act, they said, had questioned the very credibility of the church, he said.Talking to reporters after the meeting, Fr. Williams said there were several Muslim students in various schools run by the Believers' Church, and nowhere did any such rule banning headscarves exist. Apartfrom suspending the principal, Mary Jessintha, the Education Committee of the church was conducting a separate inquiry and, if need be, further punitive action would be initiated. The church would also cooperate with any probe by the government and had in fact demanded that an officer of IG rank should conduct an inquiry, he added.However, Nazir Musaliar, father of the student, said the principal's act had questioned religious customs and that a mere suspension was not enough. “She should be sacked, a criminal case should be booked against her and she should be jailed. If they do not do it, we will file a case in the court and see that she gets apt punishment,” he told reporters.Mr. Nazir also said he did not intend to send his daughter to the same school, though the school management had agreed to take her back. He wanted to send her to another CBSE school in Mannancherry. The Collector had allowed time till Monday to take a decision, he said.Mr. Venugopal, meanwhile, said he preferred the student to return to the same school. But since the parents were not of the same opinion, he would help them to secure admission in the school of their choice,The principal, Ms. Jessintha, did not participate in the meeting.Church authorities said she kept away from the meeting fearing an attack against her.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Headscarf-row-principal-suspended/article16299143.ece

It was also the arena of leaders of the rival parties to incite party workers. The situation became serious after the destruction of nearly 30 flags of the CPI(M) last month by IUML workers. The retaliatory exercise of removing the flags of the rival parties continued till a peace meeting was held at the Pariyaram police station on April 29. The meeting, attended by CPI(M) and IUML leaders, decided to restore peace in the area. Peace, however, was short-lived as the rival workers resumed the attacks on party flags and flag posts on May 3.The latest outbreak of tension was over the destruction of an IUML flagpole at nearby Poyil. In a retaliatory attack, the CPI(M) flagpole at Koranpeedika was uprooted and the CPI(M)-sponsored bus shelters in the area were given a coat of green paint by IUML activists. The police on Tuesday dismantled three bus shelters and flag posts of the rival parties. Another bus shelter constructed by the CPI(M) was dismantled by a group of IUML workers. The police registered a case against nearly 70 IUML workers in connection with the case.
All-party meet
An all-party meeting convened by Taliparamba Tahsildar P. Thampan reached an understanding that political parties could erect only one party flag each at Koranpeedika. Following opposition from the police, the meeting decided that the dismantled bus shelters, if re-constructed by the rival parties, should not carry the names of the parties and should be given the colour stipulated by the municipality.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Stern-action-by-police-defuses-tension/article16299085.ece

However, the religious activities and functioning of certain new-generation churches had been creating a social divide, which might gradually undo the social services rendered by various mainstream churches, he said.

592,Purandeswari asks States to step up education spending,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,12:56:28 IST,"Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development Daggubati Purandeswari has urged the State Governments to step up their spending on education.This was necessary to let the “fruits of education percolate down to the last child,” Ms. Purandeswari said after opening the 20th triennial convention of Xavier Board of Higher Education here on Friday.She said that in view of the landmark Right-to-Education law and the need for expanding the education base of the nation, the education sector required a much higher fund allocation. While the Union Government had enormously increased its education allocation, the States’ contributions had actually declined over the past few years.The Centre was now allocating close to 4 per cent of its budgetary pie to education and gradually increasing the share. She wanted the States to significantly increase their shares.Ms. Purandeswari said the government wanted to set up an ‘Educational Finance Corporation’ to give financial support and loans to young people so that more of them could seek higher education.She noted that the gross enrolment ratio in the higher education sector in India was “abysmally low” at 12 to 14 per cent which was far below the international average of 23. The Planning Commission had planned to raise the ratio to 15 per cent, but this was a ‘Herculean task’ now.She said the government would dovetail the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan scheme to the Right-to-Education law. She noted that there was a 20-25 per cent shortage of qualified teachers in the higher education sector.Ms. Purandeswari pointed out that research received poor attention in India.For instance, though India was considered an IT power house, the research in the area was remarkably low. While the U.S. produced some 800 PhDs, India’s score stood at a poor 25. Children should be nudged into research while in school. Noting that a substantial section of higher education was outdated, she said the sector was “ripe for reforms.”The three-day convention, being held at Rajagiri College of Social Science, has attracted authorities of some 200 Catholic higher education institutions across the country. It will discuss the qualitative changes that these institutions needed in the coming three years.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Purandeswari-asks-States-to-step-up-education-spending/article16299027.ece
593,Solution being evolved to protect Tamil Brahmi inscriptions,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,02:02:27 IST,"Once the provisions in State mining law and that of Ancient Monuments and Archaeology Sites and Remains Act, 1966, are rationalised, mining will not be possible close to sites where inscriptions are found, School Education Minister Thangam Thennarasu said on Thursday.(The State Ancient Monuments Act, which is in line with a Central law of 1958, prescribes that mining cannot be done up to 300 m of a site where a monument has been found. The mining law relaxes this and makes it 50 m. Many District Collectors, who are responsible for the grant of mining leases, take into consideration the mining law. The government lost a recent case in the High Court because of this discrepancy.)Replying to a special call attention motion, Mr. Thennarasu said his department was working with the Higher Education Minister, who was in-charge of mining, for a solution to ensure that the Tamil Brahmi inscriptions were protected. A committee chaired by Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudy was examining the issue. It was yet to finalise its recommendations.Mr. Thennarasu said the issue was also raised by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and that the need to protect the inscriptions was being taken seriously at the highest level. The government was of the view that the entire area where an inscription was found should be declared a protected area.D. Ravikumar (VCK), who raised the issue, warned that the Tamil Brahmi inscriptions were the only proof that Tamil was a classical language. Every single site of the inscriptions was being run over by quarries. Unless the government acted quickly, there was no way to save the inscriptions.All the main sites of the inscriptions – Keezhlevalavu, Tiruvadavur, Kazhugumalai, Melakuilkudi, Muthupatti and Kongarpuliyankulam – are almost congruent with the quarries, he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Solution-being-evolved-to-protect-Tamil-Brahmi-inscriptions/article16298941.ece

They had been hired to clean the tank.Intervening on a special calling attention motion on the subject, he said from the government side Rs.2 lakh each would be paid to the next of kin.

Ravikumar (VCK) – pointed to the lack of inspections and the repeated failings of the Pollution Control Board.Abdul Bahsid (DMK) wanted better pollution monitors and continuous inspections so that such incidents did not recur. Mr. Pandurangan demanded a higher compensation and jobs for the next of kin of those who died. Mr. Gnanasekharan said every year, people died of similar causes and nothing much was done. Though a common effluent plant did exist in most places, these were not enough.Mr.Raja said that both in Cuddalore and Vellore districts, the Pollution Control Board had abdicated its responsibility. He wanted the owner of the factory, where the deaths occurred, arrested.Ms. Latha pointed out that the workers did not have any protective gear when they descended into the tank.V. Sivapunniyam (CPI) faulted the lack of foresight and said that only after an accident did the establishment wake up.Gnanadoss (MDMK) said that merely giving compensation was not a permanent solution.Mr. Ravikumar said the government had to draw up a clear policy on handling sludge and sewage. The owners of the factory should not be allowed to get away lightly.Labour Minister T.M. Anbarasan said the factory had licence to process 15 lakh tonnes of goat skins each year. The sewage and sludge had chromium content and the workers did not have any protection when they went in.

599,High-tech “corporate strategy” to mark anti-Nitish Kisan Mahapanchayat,Staff reporter,2010-05-07,20:12:03 IST,"The considerable marketing skills of Bihar’s politicians would put any sharp salesman to shame, as the elaborate preparations for the upcoming anti-Nitish “Kisan Mahapanchayat” on May 9, translate like a veritable sales procurement blueprint.For every major leader behind this “Mahapanchayat” has been handed with a “business procurement target” – that of gathering a sizable amount of followers from his allotted area.It is as well, for this “show of strength” is in reality, a do-or-die situation for the many of the dissidents and the Opposition leaders, as they struggle to stay politically credible and relevant.The five major dramatis personae in his high-stakes “credibility” play to be held in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan include JD (U) dissidents and bitter Nitish critics Rajiv Ranjan Singh “Lallan” and Prabhunath Singh, LJP’s Surajbhan Singh, RJD’s Akhilesh Prasad Singh and ex-JD (U) MP Digvijay Singh.The chief objective of this rally - which is being staged by dissidents within the ruling Janata Dal (United) and prominent leaders in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) - Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP) combine - is to protest against the state government’s allegedly anti-farmer measures while provoking Mr. Kumar to comment on the contentious issue of ‘bataidar’ (sharecropper) rights in this critical election year.According to informed sources within the Mahapanchayat, the five stalwarts have divided between themselves a “target” of gathering a minimum of 30,000 upper-caste Bhumihar and Rajput farmers from 24 state districts.Similarly, lesser leaders have been asked to gather at least 15,000 supporters from the remaining 14 state districts.“Sunday’s rally will be the biggest ever to be held in Bihar in the last 20 or 25 years,” said RJD leader and former Union Minister, Mr. Akhilesh Prasad Singh, speaking to reporters today.“This rally is for the benefit of the state’s farmers. He [Nitish] must clarify his stand on the ‘bataidar’ issue,” remarked ex-MP Prabhunath Singh, who has a dozen criminal cases pending against him.If not anything, this massive ‘anti- Nitish’ ganging up certainly is a hyper-tech savvy affair indeed.As part of the aggressive campaigning, the Mahapanchayat’s media cell has flooded the farmers’ mobiles and mailboxes with text messages and electronic mails, inviting them to the rally.The logistics strategy is no less impressive as the planners have arranged no less than 35,000 private vehicles – SUVs, tempos, smaller cars - to ensure that their claques reach the venue on time.“We have also arranged for 3 special trains to ferry farmers from all over the state,” said Mr. Akhilesh Prasad Singh.Incidentally, the Left opposition too has started work in earnest with a massive rally organized by the Left parties coming up on May 10, a day after the Kisan Mahapanchayat.Their objective is to attack the Nitish Kumar government on exactly the opposite issue – non-implementation of the ‘bataidari’ bill.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/High-tech-ldquocorporate-strategyrdquo-to-mark-anti-Nitish-Kisan-Mahapanchayat/article16299097.ece

601,Merciless Australia pounds India into submission,S. Dinakar,2010-05-07,22:43:29 IST,"Australiian opener David Warner drives for a six during the Super Eight Twenty20 Cricket World Cup match against India in Bridgetown, Barbados, Friday, May 7, 2010.
  Undone by the Australian quicks on a juicy Kensington Oval pitch, India hurtled to a 49-run defeat in a Group `F' match of the ICC World Twenty20 Super Eights here on Friday.India, fatally, went into the contest a paceman short and then its batting floundered against some high quality fast bowling from Dirk Nannes and Shaun Tait.Only Rohit Sharma, getting on top of the bounce and striking the ball with timing and confidence, defied with a 46-ball unbeaten 79 as India chased a daunting 185.Even as wickets fell around him, the wristy Rohit displayed character.He pulled Mitchell Johnson for the maximum, struck Shane Watson over the long-off fence, whipped Nannes over the long-on ropes and waded into leg-spinner Steven Smith. His was a brave effort in vain.India was rocked early by the pace duo of Nannes and Tait. The side's old failing against the short-pitched stuff from the quicks was evident again.The red hot Nannes, working up real pace from a left-armer's testing angle, took out Murali Vijay in the third over when the batsman got a leading edge attempting to work one off his legs; the ball got to him faster than expected.In the same over, Nannes prised out the left-handed Gautam Gambhir on the pull stroke. The sluice gates had been opened.The speedy Tait gave little respite from the other end. IPL hero Suresh Raina looked like a cat on a hot tin roof on this bouncy track. The southpaw miscued a pull – the ball climbing into him a touch too quickly – and was walking back.Nannes then fired out the left-handed Yuvraj Singh with a scorching yorker. India was reeling at 23 for four after five overs. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, forced to target leggie Smith, holed out. And Yusuf Pathan fell to a brilliant catch by David Warner at deep point when he sliced left-arm paceman Johnson. India was 42 for six after nine overs. There was going to be only one winner in the contest.India, which opted to field, got the composition of its attack horribly wrong. It was incomprehensible why the side did not pick a third paceman in the eleven on a Barbados pitch.If Vinay Kumar - a crafty paceman well-equipped for Twenty20 cricket - is not fielded even in an emergency situation caused by the injury to Praveen Kumar, then what is the point in bringing him to the Caribbean?By retaining left-arm spinning all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and including an additional batsman, the Indians were a bowler short as well. This was a largely defensive ploy.Jadeja was dismissed for six successive sixes - off his last three deliveries of the fourth over and the first three balls of the tenth over - by Watson and David Warner.He pitched short at Watson, who was brutal with his trademark pulls. And then he bowled predictable length deliveries to the left-handed Warner, who bludgeoned the ball between long-on and mid-wicket.The Indians were paying the price for faulty selection.Jadeja had earlier grassed a hard catch at square-leg to reprieve Watson (on seven) off Harbhajan Singh.The experienced off-spinner, who operated with the new ball, varied his pace and trajectory and switched his line capably to the right-left combination. The others struggled.Watson, a terrific batsman on bouncy tracks, excelled his horizontal bat strokes. He picked the length in a jiffy and was ready with his response.Left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan was dismissed over the long-on fence by Watson. Australia and Watson seized the initiative even as Zaheer struggled to slip into a rhythm.Warner rocked from the other end. He is a powerful southpaw with terrific bat speed. He is someone who hits through the line - unmindful of the length - banking on his strength to muscle the ball over the field. The left-hander's six over long-off off Zaheer was a awesome strike.Australia, gaining momentum, was 53 for no loss after the six overs of field restrictions.The openers continued to pound the bowling. The fielders were forced to watch the flight of the ball into the stands.The breakthrough was achieved against the run of play. Watson (54 off 32 balls) reached his half-century swiping Yusuf Pathan over the mid-wicket fence and was bowled attempting a similar stroke. Theopening pair had put on 104 in only 10.5 overs. Warner (72 off 42 balls) continued relentlessly, striking Yuvraj Singh's left-arm spin for sixes in the arc between long-on and mid-wicket before being snared outside the off-stump by a delivery of extra bounce.David Hussey (35 off 22) biffed a few weighty blows during an entertaining cameo. However, the Indians came back strongly in the last two overs with left-armers Zaheer and Nehra giving little away.Australia made only eleven runs off the last two overs and just five from a superb last over of short-of-a-good length deliveries and yorkers from Nehra.But then, the Aussies had inflicted too much damage earlier.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Merciless-Australia-pounds-India-into-submission/article16299141.ece

  It will be a battle of equals when a confident England locks horns with title favourite South Africa in a Group E Super Eight match of the Twenty20 cricket World Cup at the Kensington Oval here on Saturday.While England defeated Pakistan by six wickets in their first match of the Super Eight stage on Thursday, South Africa also produced a clinical performance to get the better of New Zealand by 13 runs in the other match of the day.Neither batting nor bowling is a worry for England, which rode on Kevin Pietersen’s sizzling unbeaten 70 to defeat Pakistan and the team will expect another crackling performance from the experienced cricketer.England have an dependable opening pair of Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter, who can give a solid foundation while there are batsmen like captain Paul Collingwood and Eoin Morgan to support Pietersen in the middle-order.Their bowling has been equally impressive so far in the tournament.Ryan Sidebottom makes the batsmen’s life miserable with his consummate line and length, while Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad have the ability of producing some timely breakthroughs in the middle overs.On the other hand, consistency is the main strength of the South African batting department, which includes star all-rounder Jacques Kallis and the experienced Herschelle Gibbs.Captain Graeme Smith is coming up in the order, while the rest of line-up also has power-hitters like AB de Villiers, Albie Morkel and Mark Boucher who can pull the team out of the pit in case of any early slip-up.Their bowling line-up is also ready to give the English batsmen some tough time.Charl Langeveldt has proved his mettle with the new ball on several occasions and he will get support from speedster Dale Steyn and medium pacer Andre Botha.At times Smith would also like to take the help of Kallis who can fetch from his wide experience to produce required breakthroughs.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Impressive-South-Africa-faces-confident-England/article16299034.ece
603,Waqar frustrated with Pakistan fielding,PTI,2010-05-07,15:05:48 IST,"Pakistan coach Waqar Younis is a frustrated man after watching the pathetic fielding performance by his team during the six-wicket loss to England in their first Super Eight match of Twenty20 World Cup here.“It can be very frustrating, the way we dropped the catches and the way we fielded,” said Waqar after the match.Pakistan fielders put up a poor show as they dropped as many as five catches in the match, with off-spinner Saeed Ajmal putting down three himself.Ajmal dropped an easy catch off England opener Craig Kieswetter when he was yet to add anything to the board.Waqar, also a former Pakistan pace bowler, however, felt that all is not lost for the team but they have to the improve performance in the coming matches if they were to defend the title.“We’re not out of the tournament, so we don’t really have to worry about that,” he said.Waqar did not have any qualm to admit it was Kevin Pietersen’s unbeaten 70 that made all the difference in the match on Thursday.“You must give Kevin Pietersen credit for the way he played — he batted like a champion and took the game away from us,” Waqar said.“I thought 147 was a decent total, maybe 15 runs short — but with our bowling attack, I thought we could have managed it,” he added.Meanwhile, captain Shahid Afridi also said that they have to give the best performance in their next match against New Zealand on Saturday.“We missed our opportunities (against England) and you can’t afford to miss opportunities. We are working hard but right now I don’t know why we are missing opportunities,” Afridi said.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Waqar-frustrated-with-Pakistan-fielding/article16299033.ece

  South Africa closed out the match with finesse after its batsmen had powered the side to a strong total. In pursuit of 171, New Zealand never really threatened to win. Behind in the run-rate for most part, the Kiwis fell short by 13 runs in a critical Group `E' clash of the Super Eights at the Kensington Oval on Thursday.Eventually, Albie Morkel's brutal 18-ball 40 – his innings featured five sixes – proved the difference between the sides. The South African was adjudged Man of the Match.New Zealand required Brendon McCullum to fire but the intrepid Kiwi was spectacularly held by a diving Herschelle Gibbs at cover when he flat-batted swing bowler Charl Langeveldt in the first over.The Kiwis required at least one batsman to consolidate and guide the chase but lost wickets at regular intervals from both the ends. Jesse Ryder – he top-scored with 33 – and Martin Guptill kept the side in the hunt for a phase but the pressure created by the persistent South African bowling and sharp fielding led to their dismissals. Guptil, striking with a hint of desperation against off-spinner Johan Botha, holed out. Ryder, charging Botha, was done in by flight and loop.The talented Ross Taylor threatened briefly before being wonderfully taken by Gibbs – the South African was exceptional on the field – at mid-wicket off lanky paceman Morne Morkel. The South Africans were on the ball. Dale Steyn, fast and furious, impressed in particular.Earlier, Albie Morkel's hitting was awesome. Irrespective of the length of the ball, he was striking through the line.His strong forearms and a wonderful straight swing of the willow sent the ball into the stands between long-on and long-off. The Kiwi pacemen erred by not bowling short-of-a-good-length at him. Albie thrived.Indeed, Albie and de Villiers took the game away from New Zealand. The Kiwi bowling bled towards the end after crafty left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori had bowled bowled beautifully. The last six overs fetched the South Africans a whopping 70 runs.Albie was destructive. He bludgeoned Tim Southee for three sixes in the 19th over. The Kiwi paceman, striving for yorkers, erred in his length. He was punished.The South African dismissed Southee over long-on. Then, he struck two majestic sixes down the ground.Even Vettori, well as he bowled, did not escape punishment. Albie's six off the Kiwi skipper over long-off was a clean, uncomplicated strike.Importantly, Albie picked his spots in the arena and played to his strength. de Villiers' 39-ball unbeaten 47 was a pleasing effort. The duel between the fleet-footed South African and the canny Vettori was an engaging one. The left-arm spinner altered his length while varying his pace to keep de Villiers guessing. But then, de Villiers is a versatile batsman and he collected runs with deft placements – his ability to play the ball late is his ally – and the occasional big hit.In fact, the South Africans did well as a batting group. Gibbs dazzled for a while, smacking seamer Jacob Oram for a meaty straight six and then sweeping off-spinner Niel McCullum over mid-wicket. He eventually fell top-edging an attempted swipe off the off-spinner. Jacques Kallis blazed away at the start after South Africa elected to bat. He top-edged spearhead Shane Bond for a six. He then thumped the paceman past point. Bond was not allowed to settle down.Kallis fell to a spectacular diving catch at third man by Southee after cutting Oram uppishly. Graeme Smith, whipping one, was earlier held at deep mid-wicket off Southee.This was an afternoon when the depth in South Africa's batting came to the fore. Albie was brilliant.

Brief Scores:

South Africa: 170 for four in 20 overs (AB de Villiers 47 not out, Albie Morkel 40; Jacob Oram 1/22).New Zealand: 157 for seven in 20 overs (Jesse Ryder 33, Nathan MCCullum 26 not out; Morne Morkel 2/27).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Albie-Morkel-de-Villiers-star-in-South-Africas-easy-win/article16299032.ece

Duraisamy and a few others had been forged in the takeover process. “If this can happen to a union office, then no property is safe in Tamil Nadu,” he said.Accusing the Government of supporting such illegal and unethical acts, he said the MLF would seek legal recourse on the issue.This was not the first time the DMK’s labour wing was indulging in such acts. There had been several attempts for nearly a decade and on one such occasion the MDMK had to move the High Court for relief, he said.Mr. Vaiko also criticised the police for not acting as per the April 30 orders of the Additional District Sessions Court, Coimbatore, which said that the union led by Mr. Duraisamy was entitled to occupy the union office.The MDMK and 10 other organisations would block all roads leading to Kerala from Tamil Nadu on May 28 to highlight to the people of Kerala the truth in the Mullaperiyar Dam and other water sharing issues. Four lakh acres would turn fallow if the Kerala Government was allowed to go ahead with its plan on Mullaperiyar and other dams.Mr. Vaiko, however, clarified that the road blockade was not against the Tamil Nadu Government or the people of Kerala.

The complainant had submitted before it that she had an apprehension that the petitioner might flee the country to avoid the mediation process pending before it.The Commission had sent the request for issuance of the circular when the petitioner expressed his inability to appear before it.Acting on the Commission's request, the FRRO had offloaded the petitioner at Indira Gandhi International Airport here from a flight going to Dubai.Justice Muralidhar further said the affidavit would be filed by a senior officer of the Ministry within four weeks and he would be present in the Court on July 20, the next date of hearing, for clarification.The Court also asked the Delhi Police Commissioner to file an affidavit explaining the procedure it adopts for issuance of the circular.In addition to the Ministry, the Delhi Police had also made a separate request for issuance of the circular which was later withdrawn.The police would also reply to a contention by the petitioner that his case was unnecessarily transferred from the Crime Against Women Cell to the Anti-Extortion Cell.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Court-seeks-details-of-norms-for-issuing-look-out-circulars/article16298919.ece
611,‘State of malnutrition in Delhi worse than sub-Sahara',Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,01:26:28 IST,"“With Delhi having a malnutrition rate of 47 per cent among the urban poor and 35 per cent in the city, the rate of malnutrition is far worse than even sub-Sahara,” stated experts at a consultation on “Declining quality of life of the young child in Delhi' organised by non-government organisation Delhi Forces in the Capital earlier this week.The consultation follows a Jan Sunvai, a collaborative effort of Delhi Forces and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights.Speaking on behalf of the five-member jury of the Jan Sunwai, Dr. Vandana Prasad said they were shocked at the plight of people residing in the three bastis in Delhi -- Kirby Place, Dwarka and Jhareda.“There is a gross denial of basic rights and these ranges from lack of electricity and water supply in the permanent settlements, denial of payment of minimum wages and children's rights to survival, protection and development. Also none of the persons here had ration cards, only one person had a below poverty line card and there are no anganwadi centres at these places,” Dr. Prasad said.At the Jan Sunvai, an independent jury of eminent persons hears complaints of women from urban poor settlements of South-West District of Delhi. The jury comprised people from various sectors including non-government organisations, media and the government.Chairing the jury Mr. Amod Kanth said: “Out of the several lakh population that resides in the slum nearly 50 per cent include children. It is indeed a matter of great shame that the needs of such a large segment of neglected and deprived section of the population are not being addressed.''The Jan Sunvai also released two studies: “Situational analysis of young child in Delhi: A citizen's report” and a survey conducted by Delhi Forces in 21 bastis with a sample of 4,600 households.Sharing the findings of the jury, Dr. Vandana Prasad said: “ The Government is violating the Supreme Court orders by not providing anganwadis on a priority basis for communities that are demanding it within the stipulated period of three months. The lack of crèches on worksites is a direct infringement of the obligations the government is accountable for under the Construction Worker's Act, 1996. The jury also found that discriminatory practices relating to access, quality and affordability of health care are rampant across the three bastis. Children living with disability are often denied admission to schools.”In the light of all these violations, the jury recommended that in every slum, crèche and anganwadi centres must be opened with immediate effect, any authority that does not comply with the Supreme Court orders on opening anganwadi centres on the demand of the community must be duly punished, children affected by disability must be reached out and pro-active measures taken to address their issues including right to education in mainstream schools.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lsquoState-of-malnutrition-in-Delhi-worse-than-sub-Sahara/article16298918.ece

They also charged that the water supply in Delhi was very skewed with residents in some areas only getting an average of about 30 litres per person per day while those in others were getting over 500 litres per day.The protesters, who also included Delhi BJP general secretary Pravesh Verma and Mahila Morcha president Sarita Chaudhary, demanded that water from Sonia Vihar be immediately supplied to the Sangam Vihar area. A number of residents of Sangam Vihar, Deoli Village, Deoli Road colonies, Tigri, Mehrauli and adjoining residential participated in the protest.Mr. Jolly accused Chief Minister and Jal Board chairperson Sheila Dikshit of not managing the water resources of the city properly. He charged that while people living in Outer Delhi villages and unauthorised colonies were suffering badly due to non-availability of water, in many other areas water was being supplied in abundance.Pointing to the skewed supply, Mr. Jolly said in Mehrauli areas the DJB supplies 31 litres of water per person whereas in Delhi Cantonment it supplies nearly 16 times more or 509 litres per person per day. In Lutyens' Delhi too, there was no dearth of water with 462 litres of water being supplied per person.Noting that as against a total requirement of 1100 MGD water, the DJB is able to supply only 850 MGD water in Delhi, the BJP leader said this should have prompted the department to manage the water resources better. But, he said, water leakages in Delhi were a whopping 40 MGD and even the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has pulled up DJB for poor water management, delayed projects and water leakages. Besides, he said, the percentage of contaminated water supply has increased from 0.73 per cent to 2.88 per cent leading to spread of water-borne diseases in many areas.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/BJP-protest-against-water-crunch/article16298917.ece

However, sporadic cases continue to get reported from districts and there is always a possibility of the virus making a comeback next winter, physicians maintain.To be prepared for this eventuality, authorities on Thursday launched swine flu vaccination drive among healthcare workers, who are, when it comes to fighting H1N1 virus, the first line of defence.All government hospitals including those in the districts have been given sufficient doses of the vaccine for inoculation of healthcare workers.This is the first phase of swine flu vaccination drive and, according to authorities, the second phase covering high risk groups among general public will be taken up after an indigenous vaccine is developed.The present vaccine being administered to health workers, has been imported by noted pharma giant Sanofi Pasteur.Health care workers from private hospitals, who are willing to get inoculated, can also get themselves administered with the vaccine at any of the Government hospitals, authorities said.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has supplied close to 80,000 doses of swine flu vaccine for inoculation of health workers in the State. In all, the Centre has procured nearly 15 lakh doses of swine flu vaccine for distribution all over the country.The swine flu vaccine will provide immunity for only one year because of the possibility of the virus changing its ‘nature' and turning into a more virulent form in the next few years. “In the second phase of vaccination, which could start in three to four months, pregnant women and children will be our prime targets.Because of their compromised immunity, they are susceptible to this virus and hence they will be given the indigenous vaccine,” said state swine flu coordinator Dr. K.

Anand said here on Thursday.Participating as a chief guest at traffic awareness programme organised by APSRTC here, he asked the drivers to adhere to rules to ensure smooth flow of vehicular movement. “Stringent action will be initiated for jumping red signal at junctions and stopping buses on the roads instead of at bus bays,” he said.Explaining violations being committed by auto and bus drivers in twin cities, Mr. Anand said haphazard parking at bus bays was one of the main causes for traffic gridlocks. “Auto drivers park vehicles at bus bays forcing RTC drivers to stop buses on the main roads. As a result, vehicles coming from behind come to a standstill,” he pointed out.He said awareness programmes were organised in a phased manner for the benefit of both auto and bus drivers. “It's everyone's responsibility to follow rules,” Additional Commissioner said stating CCTVs would generate pictures of violators at the junctions. Action was initiated against shopkeepers for encroaching pavements and parking spaces.Referring to representations made by bus drivers on the delay in granting bail in connection with accident cases, he assured an appropriate decision would be taken after discussing it with other officials.RTC Regional Manager (Secunderabad) A.

Sudhi,2010-05-07,01:48:20 IST,"Five tribal leaders of the eco-development committees of Periyar Tiger Reserve, Thekkady, will reach Kochi from their hamlets on Saturday.A. Kannan, V. Satheesh, S. Panchan, D. Raju and C. Nayan are coming to Kochi to reap the fruits of hard labour their tribesmen have put in. The five-member team will receive a cheque from Forest Minister Benoy Viswom for the organic pepper their tribesmen have grown in the colonies of Mannakudi, Paliyakudi and Vanchivayal of Thekkady.Last year, the tribals of Vanchivayal harvested 13,006 kg of green pepper, which was cleaned and dried for export. After the drying and processing, 4,450 kg of pepper was exported. The organic export consignment earned the tribals Rs. 9.56 lakh. Eco Land Herbs and Spices, Hamburg, Germany, purchased the pepper.The Periyar Foundation functioning under the Periyar Tiger Reserve coordinated the activities including the collection and obtaining the export licence for pepper marketing. While collecting the green pepper, the foundation gives the tribals 33 per cent extra of the market rate.It was in 2008 that the first export consignment was sent from Vanchivayal tribal colony. During that time, 14,361 kg of pepper was collected and 3,825 kg was exported.Last year, bad weather rendered a portion of the pepper consignment unfit for export as moisture was detected in 371 kg of pepper. As there was not sufficient sunshine, the pepper was dried using driers. The pepper meant for export has been collected and stocked by the Forest department. Steps will be taken for auctioning this pepper, said Forest officials.This year, 15,245 kg of green pepper was harvested from Vanchivayal and 1,813 kg from Mannakudy and Paliyakudi colonies. This consignment will also be exported soon, said the Deputy Director of the Periyar Tiger Reserve, East Division.K.V.

620,General Hospital gears up for accreditation,Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,01:46:16 IST,"The district General Hospital is gearing up for the final inspection by the National Accreditation Board for Hospital (NABH) on May 10,11 and 12. It is the first hospital in the Government sector in the State to go in for a quality upgrade so as to receive accreditation by the NABH.The preliminary assessment was done on January 31 and February 1 in which the hospital authorities were given a list of 64 instances of non-compliance.These include putting up proper signage, installing power laundry, incomplete case history of patients, passageway to be without hurdles, statutory fire safety, Pollution Control Board's certificate and central sterilisation for equipment, linen used in operation theatres and other procedures.A central sterilisation system at a cost of Rs. 22 lakh is being installed at the General Hospital that would be completed in a couple of days. The Government has also in principle approved setting up a sewage treatment plant, though the sanction is still awaited.All the rest of the non-compliances pointed out by NABH inspectors are not a costly affair, said Junaid Rehman, nodal officer for the hospital for NABH certification.The attitudinal change of the staff is more important in complying with most of the deficiencies pointed out by the inspection team, he said. Some of the changes that have been brought about are introducing a token system in the Out Patient Department and having nurses and nursing assistants in the OPD. Computerisation is being implemented in phases.It would take about two-three weeks training to co-ordinate all the departments into the system, said Dr. Rehman.While the ratio of patient to doctors is rather poor for the 743-bed hospital which has only 43 doctors, the deficiency is being met by doctors provided on contract by the National Rural Health Mission.There is a deficiency of specialty doctors in all the government hospitals and as such the General Hospital is deficient in specialists in General Medicine, where instead of six, there are only three doctors.Likewise other departments like Ophthalmology and Psychiatry are some of the departments that have less than the required number of specialists.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/General-Hospital-gears-up-for-accreditation/article16298929.ece

  | Photo Credit: S_RAMESHKURUP A hartal has been called in Balussery and Elathur Assembly constituencies on Friday in protest against the police lathicharge on protestors at the Kinaloor industrial park.The hartal is being backed by constituents of the United Democratic Front who alleged that the survey being conducted for a four-lane road on the Malikadavu-Kinaloor road by revenue officials was on the behest of vested interests.Vehicles are exempted from the hartal which will be from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.District Congress Committee president K.C. Abu, who visited Kinaloor on Thursday, alleged that a land mafia was behind the attempt to acquire land for the four-lane road. Top district functionaries of the Congress and Indian Union Muslim League also visited the site.IUML State general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty warned the CPI(M) that it should not resort to a ‘Singur model of development' in Kerala. He condemned the CPI(M) attitude of ignoring people's struggles.Mr. Kunhalikuttty and Mr. Abu demanded an explanation from the Home Minister on why the police assaulted the protestors without any provocation. They said action should be taken against the policemen who attacked the protestors, including women and children.District Collector P.B. Salim said in a press release that the survey would be restarted only after the anxieties of all sections was solved. He termed it unfortunate that protestors provoked the police by throwing cow-dung water and stones.Dr. Salim said the road widening was taken up because this was a major demand by prospective investors who had shown interest in starting firms there. Only five kilometres of survey could be completed on Thursday, he said.The residents of Kinaloor continue to be divided over the need for the four-lane road. While CPI(M) workers and the Kinaloor Vikasana Samiti support the survey, the opponents of the project have grouped under a Jana Jagrata Samiti.The Samiti had raised its voice at a meeting convened by the District Collector at the Civil Station. The Samiti said the people in the area had initially agreed to the land acquisition for the road widening because of the interest evinced by the Malaysian agency to build a satellite city at Kinaloor as they hoped this would provide jobs and bring development to the area.Over 200 families will be displaced in the road widening. Residents said they did not trust the promise by the government of offering them five cents of land on the roadside itself to build a new house besides a job for one member of the household at the Industrial Park.Krishnan Kallidukkal, a resident whose land was surveyed on Thursday, said he was hesitant to let go off his land. “I will lose the well which provides water to mine and five other households here. After the Malaysian company withdrew I don't understand the need for this widening.”There are also notices stuck on walls on the way to Kinaloor Park welcoming the survey for road widening. But members of the Jagrata Samiti say that those are by persons owning bigger plots for whom losing a few cents of land does not make a difference.Over 700 residents of Morikkara are also opposed to the road widening. They complain that their houses will be drowned once the elevation of the road rises as it will sandwich them between the new road and the Poonoor river.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/Hartal-in-Balussery-Elathur-today/article16298927.ece

By that time, my eyes began to bleed and the college authorities sent me to an eye hospital,” he said.He said the seniors assaulted him again when he returned to college, despite the intervention of some other senior students and teachers. They threatened to seek the assistance of local anti-social elements against him and made him sign some papers. By April 2, the vision in his right eye was lost. A surgery at a Kochi hospital could restore only 10 per cent of the vision. The doctors said the damage would be permanent.He said that when his father called up the college principal demanding action against the culprits, the latter ridiculed him and alleged that the father and son were trying to make money out of the incident.He said the seniors indulging in ragging had been emboldened by the college management's alleged inaction.His mother said the college was refusing to take action, despite a complaint being sent to the management trust's Dubai office, the police and other authorities. “We paid over Rs.4 lakh in fees and had to spend Rs.2 lakh on my only son's eye treatment.

  | Photo Credit: S_James. The Central Government is offering generous subsidies to encourage advertisers and business firms to utilise solar power to light up hoardings. A 100 Watt power (Wp) solar module being used for illuminating a hoarding would get a subsidy of Rs.15,000.A solar powered 1,000-Wp system to illuminate a hoarding would cost around Rs. 2.2 lakh, of which, it is eligible for a subsidy of Rs. 1.5 lakh or nearly 70 per cent of the total cost, Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency (TEDA) Deputy General Manager (Madurai Region), S.E.S. Syed Ahamed, told ‘The Hindu' on Thursday. The Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's (MNRE) ‘Solar Off-grid Application' scheme is being implemented in Tamil Nadu by TEDA. The major benefit of such a system was that it could result in saving over 4,000 units of power per year. The advertiser could recover the cost of establishing the unit within three years.He said that the TEDA would render consultancy and all technical assistance required for such ventures. “In view of the prevailing power situation, promoting such power conservation systems will be of tremendous help. Efforts are on to popularise solar power systems.”The popularity of solar power is rising in recent times due to the increased awareness of Centre's schemes such as Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission and Rooftop Power and Stand alone Small Grid-connected Power Plant .In the TEDA Madurai Region alone, which comprises 11 southern and Central districts from Kanyakumari to Tiruvarur, 43 firms have submitted ‘expression of interest' to establish SPV Grid Interactive Power Plants of capacity ranging from one to 10 megawatt. Their approval was pending for want of final MNRE's guidelines, said Mr. Syed. The application of a firm in Sivakasi to establish a 1MW SPV plant under RPSSGP had been forwarded to the TEDA headquarters, he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Subsidy-for-utilising-solar-power-to-illuminate-hoardings/article16299029.ece

He also has a hump on his back and walks with a limp. All these congenital abnormalities have not deterred 12-year-old R. Agumani of Mottamalai next to Vilacheri near here from enjoying his childhood. But if there is something he is nervous about, it is the police!The articulate and enthusiastic young boy, who can catch and throw a ball much better than any other normal child, says that he has stood witness to the numerous atrocities allegedly let loose by the police on his family members including his 13-year-old aunt whenever the men in uniform visit their locality in search of male members in connection with theft cases.“I belong to the Kuravar tribe. My father is a trader and he sells bangles, combs, toys and other such articles. The police often come to our house either in search of my father or my paternal uncle. If they are not there, they use to torture all of us. Once, my aunt was kicked with boots. The policemen also banged her head on the wall for pleading ignorance about the whereabouts of my uncle,” he recalls.Not so different is the case of sixteen-year-old A. Kalaivendan, of Maruthapandi Nagar near B.B. Kulam here, a direct victim of torture.The boy, who had just completed his X standard, claims that he and his family members were taken to a local police station on February 15 and assaulted brutally for not disclosing the whereabouts of his maternal uncle Kalmandaiyan alias Murugan.“We were tortured to the core until my uncle surrendered. However, he was ultimately killed in an encounter on February 16. After all these incidents, I was mentally disturbed and could not go to school regularly. But somehow I regained my exposure with others' assistance and appeared for the public examinations. Otherwise, things would have worsened for me,” he says with fright.Fifteen-year-old N. Vinitha of Akkaraipettai in Nagapattinam district has a different tale to narrate. Her father and elder brother, both fishermen, were allegedly tortured by the Sri Lankan Navy for entering the island nation's territorial waters. “My father could not go for fishing after that incident and the earnings of our family dropped significantly. Even my brother is yet to come out of the trauma,” she claims.The teenage girl, now in her ninth standard, wants to study law so that she could fight for the cause of victims of human rights violations. “I am deeply moved by the plight of every other person here,” she says pointing to a group of around 100 children who had gathered for a weeklong summer camp organised by People's Watch, a non-governmental organisation based in Madurai.The child victims of torture have been taught life skills at the camp titled ‘Sangamam 2010, a celebration of child rights.'

As per official records, more than 21,000 hectares have been brought under chilli crop this year. It has been raised on an average of 3,000 hectares in Kamudhi, Kadaladi, Mudukulathur and Paramakudi blocks.

The yield in Kamudhi, Kadaladi and Paramakudi were relatively good.The chilli crop could be successfully raised with less water. The important factor was that the field should have moisture content but it should not be flooded for more than four or five days. The chilli crop was successful this year as almost all factors, including rain, were good this year. However, farmers who raised chilli in low-lying areas said that the yield was poor due to water stagnation for a few weeks in January.A. Sathiah of R.

“The judgment of the Supreme Court has set at rest numerous issues which had been raised in relation to the gas discovered and produced by RIL from the KG D6 field.

  Anil Dhirubahi Ambani Group Chairman Anil Ambani on Friday said that his group had no immediate plans to file an review petition in the Supreme Court that had rejected the claims of the company for cheap gas to its firm Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) from Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL).Talking to media persons through a conference call and taking no questions, Mr. Ambani said RNRL looked forward to an expeditious and successful renegotiation with RIL within the stipulated period of six weeks to secure gas supply for the group's power plants in line with the Supreme Court order.The Supreme Court said the government had the last word on pricing and usage. It also asked RIL and RNRL to renegotiate gas supply terms within six weeks.“RNRL has currently no plans to file a review petition in the Supreme Court,” Mr. Ambani, who was present in the court when the verdict was announced, said.Mr. Ambani said the court had safeguarded the interests of 25 lakh shareholders of RNRL by issuing guidelines for expeditious finalisation of gas supply agreement.“By a majority judgment, the Supreme Court has upheld RNRL's case that the company petition filed by RNRL as maintainable and has upheld the powers of the court to modify the scheme and make it workable,” he said. Mr. Ambani said the apex court had also acknowledged that the June 18, 2005, MoU was the basis for the business re-organisation of RIL. “The court has also directed that suitable arrangements for gas supply should not only be suitable to RIL but also the shareholders of RNRL, whose interests have to be fully protected,” he said.RNRL is seeking 28 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas from RIL's KG-D6 fields for group firm Reliance Power's proposed power plant in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/lsquoNo-plan-for-a-review-petition/article16299277.ece
634,Apex court verdict in Reliance case on Friday,J. Venkatesan,2010-05-07,00:44:30 IST,"A file photo of Anil Ambani and Mukesh Ambani. A final verdict on the gas row between the Ambani brothers is set to be delivered on Friday.
  The Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict on Friday in the case relating to ‘Reliance gas dispute' between Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) of the Mukesh Ambani group and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. (RNRL) of the Anil Ambani group, considered as one of the biggest corporate legal battles in recent years.The batch of appeals was against a June 15, 2009, Bombay High Court order that asked RIL to supply gas to RNRL at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) against the officially prescribed $4.2 per mBtu.A three-judge Bench of Chief Justice K. G. Balakrishnan, Justice B. Sudershan Reddy and Justice P. Sathasivam had reserved the verdict on December 18, 2009, after marathon arguments. Initially Justice R.V. Raveendran was on the Bench and the case was heard for few days. But he recused saying that his daughter worked for a law firm which advised RIL on global acquisitions.Thereafter, Justice Reddy was inducted into the Bench.The case pertained to RNRL's demand that it be supplied 28 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd) of gas from RIL's KG-D6 gas fields at a price of $2.34 per mBtu agreed in a 2005 family MoU.It was the contention of RIL that Central Government's gas pricing policy would prevail over any private agreement and this aspect had been overlooked by the High court in its order.On the other hand, RNRL alleged that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas was dishonest and collusive with RIL to deny RNRL its due share of gas.It contended that “any suitable arrangement” for the supply and pricing of the gas could not be subject to the approval of price by the government.It said that RNRL was entitled for 28 mscmd of gas from the KG Basin at $2.34 mBtu and though RIL was willing to supply, the government was not approving it.It said the production sharing contract (PSC) between RIL and the government entered in April 2000 was for 40 blocks in about four lakh sq. km. and the contract to supply gas between RIL and RNRL constituted less than one per cent of the gas exploration area available to RIL, “which is 336 sq. km and there are 19 wells in which exploration is taking place.” It said the policy gave full marketing freedom to the contractor to supply gas at the price he wanted.It was the Centre's argument that “the gas title is that of Government. The title only passes to the contractor under permission at point of delivery with qualified marketing freedom. RIL is no more than an agent to sell gas. Any agreement of contractor over-riding Government public sharing contract was not called for.”",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/Apex-court-verdict-in-Reliance-case-on-Friday/article16299003.ece

People were losing faith in the functioning of the NGOs. This trend should be reversed.This could be done by ensuring that the top people in all the NGOs were of high calibre and were devoted to probity and transparency. They should strive to bring about qualitative changes in the functioning of their voluntary organisations, he said.The IRCS was an organisation with high moral ideals.There were reports of misuse of blood stored in blood banks. It was incumbent upon doctors manning the blood banks to prevent such incidents.The Tumkur district unit of the IRCS had provided health insurance coverage worth Rs. 20,000 each to 10,000 students. Such activities should be emulated by other district units of the IRCS, the Governor said.

The family could be rehabilitated in a shelter acceptable to them.

In addition, the council said, the college first started offering the courses in 2008 and sought university's approval in 2009, which was against the rules.The council decided to forward its decision to the State Government.The council took the decision based on a report of a three-member inspection committee it had set up to examine the college's request for considering the three courses for autonomous status. The committee visited the college on May 3.The report tabled in the meeting said: “…the committee is of the unanimous opinion that the application for grant of autonomy for the three courses cannot be recommended. The committee opines that the college is not fit for autonomy for running the three courses.”The report said that the committee came to know that students had completed their four-semester (two-year) courses and had already appeared for the fourth semester examinations.Vice-Chancellor of the university T.C. Shivashankara Murthy presided over the meeting.Prof. Murthy said that the university could not award degrees to students of such courses because they had been designed by the college against the norms. Autonomy given to the college did not mean full freedom to design courses against the regulations of the university, he said.He wanted to know why the college did not seek the approval for the courses before starting them.With regard to the future of students, Prof. Murthy said that as they were not registered with the university, the varsity could not award them degrees. ReportThe report said that the college had not appointed qualified staff to teach the subjects that were included in the three courses. Those recruited for undergraduate courses were made to teach students in the postgraduate courses. The examination pattern adopted by the college for the three courses was not in line with the university regulations either, the report said.The college had fixed the maximum internal assessment marks at 50 for the three courses instead of 20 prescribed by the university, the report pointed out.
MA Communication
The college had two teachers with Ph.D. degrees for the postgraduate course in communication. But, basically they had been recruited to teach undergraduate students and not the postgraduate course. Of the three visiting faculty members for this course, two were not qualified. One had an MBA degree while the other had an MA in English.The report said that the marks cards issued to communication students mentioned the nomenclature of the course as Master of Communication and Media Studies instead of MA in Communication as approved by the university.The report said that the college had not recruited permanent teachers for M.Com in Applied Finance and Accounting. Five part-time teachers and two permanent teachers recruited for undergraduate courses were handling this course. One of the five part-time teachers had only a bachelor's degree and another did not have an M.Com degree, the report said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/St.-Aloysius-College-three-PG-courses-disapproved-by-council/article16298946.ece
640,Verdict can impact ADAG's power plans,Sujay Mehdudia,2010-05-07,23:27:22 IST,"With the Supreme Court delivering its much awaited verdict on the gas dispute between the Ambani brothers, the 2-1 verdict against the younger sibling, Anil Ambani, could have an adverse impact on the outcome of its power projects, including the 7,000 MW plus Dadri power project in Uttar Pradesh.Notwithstanding the assertions by the ADAG Chairman Anil Ambani that his company would continue to pursue and achieve tremendous growth in the power sector, things looked a bit different on ground.
Dadri project
The Dadri project, hanging fire for years now, will now most likely have to buy gas at the government approved price of $4.20 per mBtu (million British thermal unit) as and when the Government makes any such allocation. The verdict has also rendered Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) as a shell company as it at present has little or no projects in hand.The Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) hinted on Friday that might sell gas from its KG-D6 fields to RNRL at $4.20 per mBtu.It also said that the tenure of gas supply would have to be drastically cut from 17 years as being sought by RNRL. This could have an impact on the long-term cost analysis on the power generation plans of its gas-based projects, which are estimated at 8,000 MW, and projections by the ADAG would have to be re-drawn and re-done in the changed circumstances.There will be no impact of this verdict on its Ultra Mega Power Projects as they are all coal-based units and already half-way through with their implementation.The Supreme Court ruled that the Ambani family MoU could not over-ride the Government's right to fix price and approve utilisation of gas and had asked the two firms to renegotiate fuel supply.“The price will be what the Government has fixed. Supplies will be subject to Government allocating the fuel to ADAG firms and the tenure of supply will have to be in line with development plan approved for the KG-D6 fields,” RIL Executive Director P. M. S. Prasad said soon after the verdict.
Family MoU
In the 2005 family MoU, RIL was to supply 28 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas to RNRL for 17 years at $2.34 per mBtu. The gas was sought by RNRL to fire its proposed 7,800 MW power plant in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh.Mr. Prasad said RIL would renegotiate the agreement in line with the Government policy.The Dadri plant might not come before three years and practically supplies could not be for more than five years and the KG basin Dhirubhai-I and Dhirubhai-II finds were to last only for nine years.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Verdict-can-impact-ADAGs-power-plans/article16299117.ece

An import ban is warranted only if the Chinese imports are hurting Indian companies,” he told the official China Daily newspaper in an interview.The State-run newspaper also quoted the head of a prominent law firm in Beijing, which handles trade remedies, as saying the move was “pure protectionism”. “The Chinese side must seek consultations and a proper way out,” said Fu Donghui, Managing Director of Allbright Law.The Chinese government's response, however, was more guarded. Asked about the restrictions, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu avoided a direct reply, instead praising the growth in bilateral trade between the two countries.“China and India should be cooperative partners of mutual benefit and win-win outcome,” Ms. Jiang said. “The two countries are exerting joint efforts to reach a trade volume of $ 60 billion by 2010. It takes efforts of both sides to expand trade and enhance cooperation. We believe trade between China and India enjoys a bright prospect.”Asked to comment on the specific case, Ms. Jiang referred the question to the Ministry of Commerce.

  Welcoming the Supreme Court verdict on the Ambani brother's gas dispute that the natural gas belongs to the nation thereby upholding the Government stand on the issue, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Murli Deora on Friday said his Ministry's stand had been vindicated.Talking to newsmen after the apex court delivered the judgment on the matter, Mr. Deora said the Supreme Court had upheld the government's right to fix price of gas and decide its utilization. “Apex court verdict upholds the fact that gas belongs to the government and the people of the country and that is what we have been saying,” he said. The court through the 2-1 verdict had maintained that the Ambani family MoU seeking to divide gas between Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) was not binding, both legally and technically.“I welcome the verdict. No matter what campaign one ran against the government, the nation is supreme,” he said without naming the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group or its Chairman Anil Ambani.The Government had moved the Supreme Court asserting its sovereign right on gas pricing and utilisation.Union Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde termed the Supreme Court verdict as “fair decision” and said that it would have no bearing on the ongoing dispute State-run NTPC and RIL.
NTPC-RIL case
“It has nothing to do with RIL-NTPC case,” he said shortly after the judgment came. RIL had in 2004 bid for an NTPC tender to supply 12 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas to the State utility at $2.34 per mBtu (million British thermal unit).However, the contract could not be concluded over differences on terms. The NTPC has dragged RIL to Bombay High Court seeking performance of the contract.Mr. Shinde said the verdict had nothing to do with NTPC's dispute with RIL.“It has nothing to do with my case of NTPC against RIL. No reference has been made on the dispute in the court judgment,” he added.He also declined to comment on the supply dispute between RIL and RNRL, saying it was a matter between two brothers.Mr. Shinde acknowledged: “I was part and parcel of the ministerial panels that first approved $4.20 per mBtu price of RIL's KG-D6 gas, fixed priority and users of the fuel and then decided to appeal against the Bombay High Court decision,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/Ministrys-stand-vindicated-says-Murli-Deora/article16299123.ece

  On Sunday Russia will mark the 65th anniversary of victory in World War Two with an unprecedented military parade that will see western troops march for the first time in Red Square.Military units from WWII allies of Russia — the U.S., Britain and France — have been invited to join Russian troops for the V-Day parade on May 9. Servicemen from nine former Soviet republics will also take part.Altogether the one-hour parade will see more than 10,000 troops from 20 countries march past the Kremlin and feature several types of defence equipment for the first time, including the Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile. A total of 161 tanks and missiles will roll through the Red Square.The highlight of the parade is a flyover of 127 planes and helicopters, including Tu-160 Blackjacks and Tu-95 Bear nuclear-capable strategic bombers, the world's biggest transport plane, An-124, mid-air refuelling tankers, as well Sukhoi and Mikoyan fighters.Rehearsals for the parade have been going on for the past week, shutting down traffic in downtown Moscow for several hours every day. Military parades will also be held in 70 other Russian cities, involving a total of about 100,000 troops.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Chinese President Hu Jintao are among 25 foreign leaders set to attend. Many other countries are sending in delegations to Moscow. However, India will be conspicuously absent from the Moscow celebrations in contrast with the 60th V-Day anniversary, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. It is true that in 2005 Mr. Singh came at a special invitation of then President Vladimir Putin, whereas this year President Dmitry Medvedev sent out personal invitations only to the leaders of the former Soviet states. However, all other countries were also invited to attend.The Indian Embassy in Moscow could not say why New Delhi decided not to send any delegation. All that an embassy spokesperson would say was that “the Government of India will not be represented”, in the Moscow festivities.It may be argued that India was not directly involved in the world's most destructive war. But then, Vietnam was not involved either and Israel did not even exist at the time. Yet, both states will be represented in Moscow. Besides, “several thousand Indian troops also laid down their lives” in WWII, as Mr. Singh recalled on departure to Moscow for the 60th V-Day anniversary five years ago.In his statement for the press on the occasion, Mr. Singh made it clear that he was going to Russia, not only to commemorate “the immense sacrifices made by Russia and other allied countries in defeating the forces Fascism and Nazism”, but also because “we attach the highest importance to our relations with Russia, which has been a tried and tested friend, and has stood by us in times of need”.There is no evidence to suggest that New Delhi has since revised either its assessment of Russia's contribution to WWII victory or its view of bilateral relations with Russia. India is still the most trusted strategic partner of Russia, whose arms played a no small role in defending India's independence over the past decades.Yet, no India official will be present in Red Square on Sunday to mark Russia's most sacred holiday, for which its people paid a horrendous price of almost 27 million lives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Moscow-readies-for-V-Day-parade/article16299116.ece
647,Mauritius wants greater Indian role,Pranay Gupte,2010-05-07,23:20:47 IST,"Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun
  Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun says that Mauritius wants greater participation by Indian companies in developing the infrastructure of this island-nation.“Our bilateral relations have always been excellent, but we feel that there's much more room for collaboration,” Mr. Beebeejaun said in an interview with The Hindu on Friday at his modest office in the capital city of Port Louis. “We expect more interest from our friends in India in setting up enterprises here.”Besides strengthening the infrastructure of this Indian Ocean country of 1.3 million people, Mr. Beebeejaun said Indian companies could assist in such fields as renewable energy, shipping, electricity generation, and sewage-treatment.“I can personally assure you that Indian companies will be welcome in Mauritius,” the 75-year-old Deputy Prime Minister said. “But they should be more present, and more forceful. Certainly, all Indians who come here are made to feel at home. But that's only the first step. The second step is that we want them to assist us in our sustainable economic development efforts, and deliver. But hardly any Indian firms are showing much interest so far.”Mr. Beebeejaun suggested that foreign direct investment from Mauritius into India “could possibly increase”. The current FDI figure of nearly $12 million annually is the highest of any country in India, and more than three times that of the next biggest FDI provider, the United States.The FDI from Mauritius is not necessarily indigenous money but funds routed from other sources that take advantage of this country's liberal tax regulations. India, however, does not figure high on the list of countries from where Mauritius imports consumer and other products. India annually sends about $200 million worth of such goods, including cotton, to Mauritius — barely 10 per cent of this country's total imports. Imports from China exceed $500 million, and more and more Chinese tourists have also been coming here in recent years.Mr. Beebeejaun spoke a day after winning a tough race in the election for the 60-member Parliament. The three-party alliance led by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam obtained 41 seats, while 18 went to the leftist Mouvement Militant Mauricien, and one was wrested by an Islamist candidate.The Deputy Prime Minister looked fit and surprisingly relaxed for a man who had just completed a brutal political campaign. In that campaign, he was maligned by Muslim opponents as not being a faithful Muslim.Mr. Beebeejaun said he was not bothered by “false and malicious” accusations.“Some Muslims resented the fact that I did not say that I was a Muslim first and foremost,” he said. “I am first and foremost a Mauritian. I am a man of deep personal faith. I practise my religion. But I believe in sharing universal values. I believe in nation building. I participate in all national functions. I attend Chinese festivals, I attend Hindu festivals, I attend mass at churches. I feel enriched by such exposure to my country's diversity and religions.”“Mauritius is one place where we celebrate our differences,” Mr. Beebeejaun said. “As in India, Hindus and Muslims and Christians and others live together under the banner of one nation. Those who seek divide us pollute minds and create groundwork for an undesirable legacy.”He was alluding to the communalism that has long characterised certain sectors of Mauritian society, where nearly 50 per cent of the population is Hindu, followed by other communities such as Creoles, Christians, Muslims and whites of French descent known as Francos.“We seek to build in Mauritius a nation where every component of society feels part of the national spirit,” Mr. Beebeejaun said. “I belong to a government that represents all our people, and not any one single community.”Indeed, Mr. Beebeejaun added, Mauritius could point proudly to the fact that, as a nation, it had acquired a reputation for being non-ideological and nonpartisan. Noting the many friendships of his friend and boss, Prime Minister Ramgoolam, with world leaders of different political persuasions, Mr. Beebeejaun said the non-partisanship of Mauritius in world affairs offered it “independence and flexibility”.
On the international scene
There are reports that these elements may be utilised by Mauritius to amplify its voice on the international scene, perhaps through the establishment of a centre for the global south. Such a centre could consist of a think tank on strategic communications and public diplomacy, and also focus on promoting cross-cultural understanding.While Mauritius has maintained non-partisanship sine its independence from the British 42 years ago, it has also sought to strengthen economic links with other developing nations, particularly in Africa, West Asia, and Asia.In recent years, Asian giants such as China and India have figured large on the Mauritian radar. China is building an industrial city here to assemble consumer and other goods for re-export to Africa and Europe. Indian leaders visit Mauritius frequently, and Prime Ministers Ramgoolam and Manmohan Singh are known for their warm rapport.Asked how concerned he was that the growing Chinese economic presence in Mauritius is reportedly irritating India, Mr. Beebeejaun said: “Our relationship with China is not at the expense of India. We believe in friendship and cooperation with all countries who demonstrate good will toward Mauritius.”
Correction

The fifth paragraph of an article “Mauritius wants greater Indian role” (Op-Ed, May 7, 2010) was “The current FDI figure of nearly $12 million annually is the highest of any country in India, and more than three times that of the next biggest FDI provider, the United States.” The figure should have been “$12 billion”.

The first three companies to use it are TE Data, Vodafone Data and Link Registrar, said the country's Communications Minister, Tarek Kamel, hailing “a milestone in internet history”.Instead of using the old .eg domain name, organisations in Egypt can use “.misr”, written from right to left in Arabic script as the default country code for domestic websites. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also introducing the new codes, respectively “.Al-Saudiah” and “.Emarat”.One of the first of these “internationalised domain names” leads to the Egyptian Communications Ministry. If a browser has the correct fonts installed, the user should see an Arabic name. When you mouse-over or click on the link, what you see will depend on the browser. “Confusing for us, a relief for the Arab world,” commented the specialist IT site THINQ.co.uk.The move comes six months after the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann, approved the use of non-Latin domain names.The innovation is a significant moment for the internationalisation of the world wide web — half of whose users do not use a Latin script as their primary language.Arabic accounts for one per cent of all web content — though its estimated 280 million speakers constitute five per cent of the global population — but until now it has had to be hosted under Latin addresses. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/World-wide-web-launches-Arabic-URLs/article16299115.ece

Rather than attempting to realistically portray the Mahatma or Tagore, the actors pay more attention to the content of the letters. These missives reveal the ideological differences between these two greats over the freedom movement, and how the rift widened over the years. The play is directed by Vijay Padaki, an active theatreperson for over 50 years, and 1993 winner of The Hindu award for his script, Credit Titles.For the five performances in Bangalore, the role of Gandhi will be explored by Anand Ramprasad and alternately by Sanjeev Iyer and the role of Tagore by Abhijit Ganguly and Shashank Purushotham. The play will be narrated by Aparna Nori and alternately Kshema Shivakumar.The script, which is highly educational in content but entertaining nonetheless, was adapted by BLT from a manuscript by Shailesh Parekh, Tagore scholar-translator. It is based on the archival research by Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, the former Vice-Chancellor of Visva Bharati University.BLT in association with Vibgyor Entertainment, will stage the play at the Ranga Shankara from June 4 to 6.

  | Photo Credit: V Sreenivasa Murthy Unlike their parents who hurried to their schools and colleges to check out their SSLC and II Pre-University Course (PUC) results, youngsters in the city logged on to the Internet or used the SMS service (extended by several service providers) to check out their results on Thursday.While many headed to Internet cafes, others logged on at home or simply got their results on their phones. However, II PUC students had to wait till evening to access their results even as they were uploaded at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time.No less than 16 sites hosted the results, making it a smooth affair for students. Interestingly, Internet cafes — that are usually crowded on results day — recorded a decline in the number of students coming in. Café owners attributed this to the fact that the youngsters were using their mobile phones or logging in at home to download their results.Sanjay S., a student from the NPL Shastri PUC College, despite having scored 92 per cent, said he was disappointed. Others showed more enthusiasm and rejoiced like Anutha M., a student of Government Girls College, Malleswaram, who said she was more than happy with her first class.Not so Shweta Gopalakrishan, a student of Cambridge Indiranagar School, and her mother. The two were despondent stepping out of the cyber cafe near their home in Domlur. At 69 per cent, Shweta said the math paper did her in. “Many were crying even as they came out of the examination hall then. We are disappointed,” she said.At another cyber café near Mount Carmel College, students seemed happy with their results. Erum Saba, who aspires for a medical career, said she was forced to come out as there was a power cut at home. She secured 81 per cent. Neha Anjum of St. Anne's College got a second class. She was happy with her results, and plans to do her masters in psychology.With most students having checked their results at home or on their mobile phones, schools wore a deserted look. Ramani Hariharan, Principal, Vidya Vardhaka Sangha High School, Rajajinagar, said the school has secured 100 per cent pass results for the 34{+t}{+h} time in a row.Of the 12 students who visited Cyber Professionals, an Internet cafe in Jayanagar, only two had passed, while the mood was a few shades better at Cyber International, another Internet café, in Sarakki Layout, where 11 out of the 15 students checking their results passed.The scene at most centres was largely marked with disappointment with some students scoring as low as 20 per cent. On the brighter side however, Pavan B. of Vijaya High School scored 86 per cent, one of the highest recorded in this area. “I didn't expect this much, so I am happy,” he said.Rahul S. of Oxford School also emerged from the booth at a browsing centre with a smile on his face, having secured 81.6 per cent. “My mother is satisfied with my marks,” he said happily.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/Students-logout-with-joy%E2%80%A6-and-sorrow/article16299000.ece

Ram, Editor-in-Chief, The Hindu, said as a newspaper, The Hindu had been trying to focus on, among other things, the area of quality and relevant education. It was the newspaper's social responsibility to inform young people of the opportunities available, he said.Pointing to a “major transformation” in southern India in regard to educational opportunities, he said the overall development was impressive, though with several gaps and a lopsided demand for engineering and engineering-plus education.“There are also concerns about quality and unevenness of what is on offer, and there is a huge shortage of qualified faculty. So, there is a lot of work to be done here,” Mr. Ram said.Pointing to changing trends in the era of globalisation, he said: “In the old days, nationalism meant that you wanted your young people to stay home and barriers were erected to people going abroad to study, but that has changed now.”Bryan Dalton, acting Consul-General, U.S. Consulate-General in Chennai, said such fairs were crucial to help students understand the options and “find the best fit”.Pointing to an increased emphasis on international education and reasons to value it, he said U.S. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made cooperation in education and development one of the five pillars of newly defined U.S.-India strategic partnership.Apart from stalls put up by universities and education consultants, the venue also has State Bank of India's stall to exclusively focus on student loan options.Day two of the fair will also feature a series of workshops.

  Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi on Friday clarified in the Assembly that there will not be any tariff hike for 'the sections of society for whom the Communist Party of India (Marxist) claimed to be working'.He was reacting to a query from CPI (M) floor leader K. Balabharathy on the tariff hike issue during the debate on the demands for grants to the Energy Department.The CPI (M) leader pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board had submitted a petition to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission for the tariff hike in respect of domestic consumers consuming over 200 units [bimonthly], small industrial units and other establishments.She also recalled the Chief Minister's statement on Thursday that there would not be any tariff hike and urged him to give up the move to increase the tariff.Mr. Karunanidhi said that the free power supply scheme for farmers and handloom weavers would continue.Replying to the debate, Law Minister Durai Murugan asserted that the State would be surplus in power during 2011-2013 as a number of generation projects, now under execution, would be commissioned.Responding to the criticism of former Electricity Minister R. Viswanathan (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) that the present government had neglected generation projects, the Minister said apart from pursuing the projects initiated by the previous AIADMK regime, the DMK government had taken the initiative to execute several projects such as Mettur Thermal Power Station – Stage III (one unit of 600 megawatt); a joint venture project with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) in Udangudi (two units of 600 MW each); and a thermal power project in Kattupalli (1,600 MW).Referring to the AIADMK's contention that there was no power cut when it was in power during 2001-2006, Mr. Durai Murugan argued that the DMK regime, during 1996-2001, had closely followed up the implementation of many projects initiated by the AIADMK in its previous spell (1991-1996). As a result, capacity addition of 1,197.57 MW was achieved. This was why there was no power cut during the subsequent AIADMK regime.When Peter Alphonse (Congress) asked the Minister to spell out the State government's plan of action to implement projects under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, he replied that the State would implement solar energy project as soon as the Centre announced its guidelines.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Karunanidhi-clarifies-in-House-on-power-tariff/article16299224.ece

Several others too received copies of the question paper in advance and some accused received monetary consideration for supplying it.According to the petitioners, a senior police officer, Radhakrishnan, the then member secretary of the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board, was an accused in both the FIRs relating to the year 2005.

Veeraswami, said they were among the chief reasons responsible for the power shortage experienced during 2009-2010. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) was forced to impose certain restrictive measures to limit the demand. Of 2,000 megawatt (MW) to 2,500 MW being procured from the market to meet the present deficit, 490 MW to 740 MW was purchased form captive power plants in the State.Giving projections of power shortage from June 2010 to May 2011, he stated that the deficit would vary from 1,400 MW to 3,400 MW during peak hours (6 p.m. to 10 p.m.); 1,700 MW to 3,600 MW during day (6 a.m. to 6 p.m) and 500 MW to 2,100 MW during off-peak hours (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.)Former Electricity Minister R.

Vijay Kumar,2010-05-07,02:07:15 IST,"A special force of commandos to counter terrorism has been created in all cities and districts in the State and young constables handpicked from the Tamil Nadu Special Police battalions are undergoing training designed for the purpose by the Tamil Nadu Commando Force in consultation with the National Security Guard (NSG).The Quick Reaction Team (QRT) will be armed with sophisticated weapons.“In the first phase, QRTs from 14 districts are undergoing training. They will be deployed at the venue of the World Classical Tamil Conference at Coimbatore in June. By the end of the year, all cities and districts in the State will have the commando teams operational,” Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) K. Radhakrishnan told The Hindu on Thursday.Since the Tamil Nadu Commando Force stationed in Chennai was meant for countering urban terrorism, the government had issued instructions to raise Special Forces in tier two and three cities.“Commandos of the QRT will not be deployed for routine policing. Each team, comprising 35 personnel, will be divided into three groups. While one group led by an officer in the rank of an Inspector will be available round-the-clock, the other two teams will study the topography of vital installations, areas of public gathering and other possible targets of terrorist attacks,” he said.Mr. Radhakrishnan said the expertise of the NSG was taken while devising the training module.“Immediate intervention is essential in the event of any emergency…we need special trained personnel to handle such situations. The Chennai Police and Chennai Suburban Police will also have a QRT each.”He said in the event of any threat or attack, the local Deputy Commissioner of Police (in city) and Deputy Superintendent of police (in district) would automatically assume the responsibility of Incident Commander.Local police would provide support such as cordoning off the disturbed area, moving the injured to hospitals, traffic regulation and media management.Mr. Radhakrishnan said there was no specific threat of any terrorist attack in the State and the exercise was only to enhance the level of preparedness of police to handle exigencies.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Special-force-to-counter-terrorism/article16298945.ece

  The toppers from Tamil Nadu in UPSC 2009-2010 drew inspiration from senior IAS officers in the State cadre.R. Lalitha, who stood 12th in the all-India ranking list, as a final year civil engineering student at Periyar Maniammai University in Thanjavur was impressed by the way Tiruchi Collector Ashish Vachhani transformed Thiruvalarchipatti village in Tiruverumbur taluk within a few months.Lalitha believed she could do a lot for people as a bureaucrat and gave up the option of pursuing higher education abroad to set her sights on becoming a civil servant.Working as an engineer at the Airports Authority of India in Chennai, Lalitha cleared UPSC in 2007 but was ranked 543. She gave up the job to devote herself preparing for the civil services.“There are a lot of government schemes. Implementation is the problem. As a bureaucrat, I will do my best to make a difference to the lives of people,'' she says with confidence.The all-India rank 15 has come as a wedding gift for M. Kanagavalli. The 30-year old, who works as assistant director at the Rural Development Department in Tiruchi, came out with flying colours in her final attempt and fourth interview in the UPSC.Working in the State government in various posts at the Secretariat, Commercial Taxes and Rural Development departments for the past four years, she had been preparing on her own. The mock interview at the Anna Institute of Management helped her.“IAS officers P.W.C. Davidar and T. Udayachandran asked me to face the interview as an officer and answer with authentic data. Fortunately, the interview panel asked me questions mainly on rural and social schemes in Tamil Nadu.”“I am an officer now and the confidence level is high. I want to join IAS. I will be happy if I get the home cadre. My second option is Karnataka,” says Kanagavalli, who is getting married to Thanesh, an industrialist based in Bangalore. She attributes her success to her sister Jhansi.K. Sankar Ganesh has cleared the civil services with a national rank of 483 and can now be an IRS officer. He wants to fulfil the dream of his two brothers, who dropped out of school after Class VIII.Born as the fourth child of M. Karuppiah, a farmer, and P. Mariammal, an anganwadi worker, Ganesh, who holds a diploma in textile technology, worked in Madurai and Tirupur. While at work, he pursued B.A in Economics through distance education at Madurai Kamaraj University and was ranked first in the university.Studying at the All India Civil Services Coaching Centre at Anna Nagar and Ganesh IAS Academy, the 28-year old has cleared the exam in his fifth attempt with economics and Tamil literature as electives.“I will write the exam next year. I want to be an IAS officer,” he avers.As many as 43 candidates who trained at the Manidhaneyam free IAS coaching centre have cleared UPSC 2009-10. R.

670,No substitute for balanced diet,Ramya Kannan,2010-05-07,00:28:52 IST,"A wide choice for a balanced diet. File Photo: K. Ananthan
  They come in many shapes, sizes and colours, are easy to take, and can boost your health. But if you think these pills (minerals, vitamins, and protein), or nutritional supplements can replace a balanced diet, think again. While there is no denying the significance of these nutritional supplements in specific cases, it would be a fallacy to believe that popping a pill or downing a protein shake will save you the trouble of picking your vegetables, fruits, and meats.Meenakshi Bajaj, medical nutrition therapist, at the Government General Hospital, says there is nothing yet that can replace a balanced diet. In some cases, she adds, such supplements will find a place in the doctor's prescription and then, they are essential.For instance, they are useful for crucially-ill patients, for those who are on a crash diet programme to aid wound-healing, and for those with specific deficiencies. She adds that pregnant and lactating mothers, the chronically undernourished, those on nasal feeding tubes, patients with conditions that can cause mal-absorption and the elderly will derive benefits from prescribed nutritional supplements.Sheela Nambiar, director, TFL Fitness Studio, touches on protein supplements. While a regular person requires 0.8 grams of protein per kg body weight, for someone who is training or body building it goes up to 1 – 1.5 grams.“You can get it in your diet, provided it is extremely well balanced and you can get the protein without the fat. But for vegetarians who are also body-builders, that quantity of protein is difficult to get with just their diet,” she explains. Therefore, the protein supplements. However she cautions that if you increase protein consumption and not burn it off, it tends to settle as fat. However, there is a thing such as overdosing. While excess content is flushed out in the urine, there are other fat soluble vitamins (A, B, E, and K) that are stored in the fat and can cause damage.Meer Mustafa Hussain, paediatrician, says such nutritional supplements always have to be monitored. For older children, where the dietary consumption is far from satisfactory, doctors recommend supplements to fill a specific deficiency.So what is an ideal nutritive diet? Dr. Bajaj says that it would be 400-500 ml of skimmed milk, 4-5 serving of fruits, vegetables (of all colours) and whole grams along with 6 -11 of cereals; 1-2 portions of non-vegetarian food, along with plenty of fluids.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/No-substitute-for-balanced-diet/article16298914.ece

  Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi on Thursday ruled out power tariff hike for consumers and the withdrawal of free power supply scheme.There would be no room for agitations (on this issue), the Chief Minister told the Assembly during the debate on the demands for grants to the Energy Department.Earlier, Law Minister Durai Murugan, who moved the demands on behalf of ailing Electricity Minister Arcot N. Veeraswami, said the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board had recently submitted a tariff revision petition before the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission.“The current tariff proposal is a small step forward in the direction of correcting the tariff imbalances, affecting the [Tamil Nadu Electricity] Board and making it at least partially financially viable. While submitting the tariff revision petition, utmost care has been taken to spare agriculture and other needy and weaker sections of society from increase in tariff,” the Minister stated.No tariff hike was proposed for low tension domestic consumers who consumed up to 200 units bi-monthly, hut dwellers, places of worship and power loom weavers. Among high-tension consumers those who had taken power connection for lift irrigation were spared, he said.The Electricity Act of 2003 provides the scope, under Section 65, for the State government to grant subsidy to any consumer or class of consumers in the tariff determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission.When the government decides to provide subsidy, it has to compensate in advance the power utility concerned in the manner as the State Commission may direct.Besides, as per sub section 1 of section 108 of the law, the Commission, in its discharge of functions, would be guided by the State government's directions, expressed in writing, on matters of policy involving public interest.In June 2004, the AIADMK regime had invoked section 108 (1) of the Act and issued a policy directive to the TNERC, restoring concessions in tariff for domestic, agricultural and hut services.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Karunanidhi-rules-out-hike-in-power-tariff/article16298890.ece

673,Khap panchayat: signs of desperation?,Jagmati Sangwan,2010-05-07,23:03:09 IST,"In Haryana today, rapid capitalist transformation is accompanied by a regressive feudal consciousness. As education and political awareness spread among Dalits, women and backward sections, alongside there is a massive consolidation of caste (
khap) panchayats in defence of the status quo. The number of cases in which the totally unconstitutional caste panchayats have openly defied the law of the land by issuing illegal diktats has increased manifold. Attacks on young couples, Dalits and progressive-minded people have become frequent.A recent landmark judgment by the Additional Sessions Court at Karnal in the Manoj-Babli “honour” killing case, in which five accused were given the death sentence, sent shock waves among caste panchayat leaders, as it reminded them that they were not above the Constitution. The court took serious note of the fact that the policemen deployed for the security of Manoj and Babli actually facilitated the accused in perpetrating the crime.Though geographically small, Haryana is socially and culturally heterogeneous. For example, in some areas and among certain castes, marriages within the village and even intra-
gotra marriages are not uncommon. At the same time, such marriages are treated as incest in certain other areas, and among other castes. Even the caste or khap panchayat is not a feature prevalent throughout the State, as many believe, but is confined to a particular region. Thus, a section of people of one particular caste proclaims itself as the cultural representative of Haryana, refusing to acknowledge the customs and traditions practised by others in their own neighbourhood.A look at the demography of the State and its development statistics would help to contextualise the problem. The State that stood second in per capita income in the country has one of the lowest sex ratios (821 in the 0-6 age group). Female foeticide is rampant, and the situation is so bad that wives are being brought from far off States. Not once have these panchayats called a maha-panchayat to pass a resolution against female foeticide or dowry or even in connection with the crisis in agriculture — problems staring the people of Haryana in the face.After the judgment in the Manoj-Babli case, however, a congregation of caste panchayats representing the Jat neighbourhoods from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan was called at Kurukshetra on April 13. It was decided that panchayats would now fight for legal status to legitimately maintain the “social order.” One of the main agendas of this sarv-khap panchayat was to push for amendments to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 that would ban marriages within the same gotra (clan within which men and women are considered siblings and hence cannot marry). Under this Act, marriages between certain lineages from the paternal and maternal sides are already barred.Most of the khap panchayat diktats are against couples who are not from the same gotra. In fact, not more than one case of honour killing has been of a couple within the same gotra. By creating the false impression that all marriages of choice between young couples are incestuous, what the khaps are actually opposing is the right to choose a marriage partner. Among the several instances of khaps issuing fatwas in Jaundhi, Asanda, Dharana, Singhwal, Hadaudi, Maham-kheri, Ludana and other villages, not a single one was an intra-
gotra marriage, yet the married couples were declared siblings, and families made to suffer boycotts and excommunication from their villages.A sad example of the gotra row is that of Ved Pal Moan, brutally beaten to death last year when he tried to secure his wife who was confined by her parents at Singhwal village in Jind district. He was escorted by a police party and a warrant officer of the High Court. Ved Pal had married neither within his gotra nor within the same village. In this case, another absurd code was invoked by the khap: that the couple violated the custom of not marrying in the neighbouring village as it forms part of bhaichara (brotherhood). A khap congregation held in March 2009 publicly pronounced the death sentence for Ved Pal, and it succeeded in executing it in June. As couples are selectively targeted, it is clear the real motive is to control women's sexuality to ensure that property remains within the patriarchal caste domain (mainly Jats in Haryana).The sarv khap panchayat also called for social boycott of individuals who raised their voice against the caste panchayats. A former police chief of Haryana, himself a self-styled caste leader, went on record threatening khap-critics. How can a former DGP publicly threaten law-abiding citizens, and yet continue to enjoy the hefty perks and pension out of the public exchequer?The caste panchayat leaders have decided to stifle any voice of assertion from the backward sections. On April 21 more than 20 houses of Dalits were burnt down at Mirchpur village, in the presence of a police force, allegedly by thugs belonging to a dominant caste, resulting in the death of an 18-year-old handicapped girl and her ailing father. A panchayat of khaps convened at Mirchpur three days after the carnage not only declared all arrested persons innocent but also issued an ultimatum to the government for their release! This was exactly the pattern adopted by caste panchayats in the Gohana (2005) and Duleena (2002) incidents, where brutal attacks on Dalits took place.Even elders from socially and economically weaker families are not spared. At Khedi Meham in December 2009, the father of a newly wed groom was forced to hold a shoe in his mouth in front of the whole village by the panchayatis. Ordinary citizens are caught in the contradiction between two sets of values — the blind consumerism of the neo-liberal dispensation, and the outdated feudal values represented by the khaps. The first is no replacement for the second, and indeed, pseudo-modernism only strengthens the forces of revivalism. The alternative to both types of distortions lies in the spread of healthy and progressive values that can be unleashed through only a new social reform movement in the entire Hindi belt.
Limited but crucial role
The judiciary does have a crucial role to play but has its limitations too. On June 23, 2008 Justice K.S. Ahluwalia of the Punjab and Haryana High Court made a revealing observation while simultaneously hearing 10 cases pertaining to marriages between young couples aged 18 - 21: “The High Court is flooded with petitions where … judges of this Court have to answer for the right of life and liberty to married couples. The State is a mute spectator. When shall the State awake from its slumber [and] for how long can Courts provide solace and balm by disposing of such cases?” A legislature with little political will and a pliant executive will have to be made responsive under pressure of a mass movement.The voices of dissent are also getting consolidated under the umbrella of organisations like the AIDWA and other democratic forces. The younger generation must stand forth as responsible social activists and lead the struggle for change in an otherwise feudal society that lives by the dictum “
Jiski lathi uski bhains” (the powerful call the shots). In Haryana each passing day is costing the lives of innocent women and men.

674,Beating the summer heat,HARJEET KAUR,2010-05-07,16:32:41 IST,"A cool interior space uses chiks or blinds. Photo: N. Sridharan
  | Photo Credit: N_SRIDHARAN Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, sang Nat King Cole. The heat wave begins across India, especially south India, as early as March and by May the heat comes beating down. In summers, you don't just need coolers to beat the heat. Your home, too, requires a combination of colours and decor items to become a ‘cool' place to hang out in. The best thing to start preparing your home for summers is by focusing on the fabrics you choose for decorating your space.
Keep it light
It's time to pack away your heavy silks, chenilles and brocades on your sofas and switch to cool fabrics like cotton, linen and jute. If your sofas are upholstered in rich burgundy or deep plum, there's an easy way to get the summer look going. Keep a set of loose covers handy in linen or cotton and simply slip them on. These can be easily packed away once the heat is done. Make sure the colours are cool too: try vanilla, lime green, custard yellow, peach and apricot. If these are too bland for your bold tastes, throw in cushions in red, magenta, turquoise and orange. These will help balance the colour quotient and keep your home from looking too plain and pastel.Now, for the drapes. Here too the silks and brocades should be put away. “One can replace them with translucent and free-flowing materials which let in some light, yet keep your home cool. Voile, organza and chiffon are ideal material choices. Stick to floral and botanical prints as they tend to keep the ambience fresh and breezy,” suggests Archana, a homemaker. If your room gets too much sunlight, it's a good idea to opt for double curtain rails. One rod can be lined with heavy drapes while the other can have dainty lace or wispy sheers. Chiks or blinds are another option. You can get them custom-made as per the decor of your room.Less is more during summer as clear spaces allow for effective circulation of air around the house. So cut the clutter. Hibernate the heavy carpets and strew the floor with small area rugs or cotton dhurries, as the more floor you show, the cooler your home will look and feel. Pack away extra artefacts that may have made your space look cosy in winter and don't give you unhindered air circulation in summer. Sushmita, an interior decorator, suggests that if you have an extensive collection of art, it's a good idea to store away your bold oils and replace them with landscapes or watercolours. Keep fresh flowers like malli puvvu and jasmine in urlis filled with water to spread a fresh fragrance around the house.Don't forget your porch this summer. Use wicker chairs for a relaxed meeting with a friend. Use gaily-coloured cushions and have a basket of fruit on the table.
Decorating tips
*Try to give your wall a refreshing look either by painting with light colours or with wallpaper.*Add summer accessories to match the indoor colour. You can choose paper fans, birdhouses, fruit bowls, coloured stones, marbles or beach shells.*Replace dark lampshades with lighter ones or floral printed ones.*Make changes in your bathrooms too. Change to lightweight fabric flower curtains with matching hand towels.*A mirror in the wall that reflects the scenic beauty of garden into the living room can make a world of natural difference.*Candles and potpourri can lend a fragrant ambience on a summer evening",https://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/Beating-the-summer-heat/article16299046.ece

Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan is to be the chief guest at the function.A top AAI official told The Hindu that the works were in full swing to commission the terminal on May 20. The Kerala State Electricity Board would provide power from the 66 kV second feeder and the Kerala Water Authority the sewerage connection this week itself.The 220-metre-long six-land bridge and two exclusive ramps connecting them from Chakka and Eenchakkal, constructed at a cost of Rs.21.73 crore by KITCO for the State government to connect the airport terminal to the National Highway 47 bypass had been completed .The black topping of the road and the bridge that has come across the Parvathy Puthanar will commence on Friday. “It will be completed by Sunday evening,” a KITCO official said.The AAI has completed the ramp to connect the approach road and the bridge to the parking bay in front of the terminal. The AAI is to take up the black topping.Fully funded by the AAI, the terminal was constructed by Chennai-based Consolidated Construction Consortium. The terminal building, with a maximum height of 19 m, has all the modern facilities, including escalators and elevators.The complex has 18 check-in counters, 20 immigration counters, 11 customs counters, two security gates, two baggage claim belts, a bus lounge and a Rs.5-crore sewerage system. The aerobridge procured from Indonesia has been installed.The four parking bays, constructed at a cost of Rs.14.5 crore, has been integrated with the existing 3,398-metre-long runway of the airport. With this, the aircraft can now reach the new terminal building at the Chakka side.Constructed using modern design concepts, the terminal building has been covered with heat reflecting toughened glass. The terminal will look like an aircraft from the tarmac.
Second phase
The Rs.80.58-crore second phase work for the Rs.245.58-crore terminal complex was also taken up along with the first phase. An additional 8,000 sq m of floor area was added with the lateral extension of the terminal building by 27 m on Karali side and 40 me on Chakka side. With this, the total floor area of the terminal complex has gone up to 30,000 sq m.In the Rs.165-crore first phase, work of the Rs.115-crore terminal building, apron and car park that can accommodate 575 cars was taken up.“The work for setting up the offices of the airlines and other stake-holders had commenced only recently and the terminal will start working only after a month,” the official said.Labour disputes over unloading of construction materials, non-availability of construction materials, unseasonal rain and delay on the part of the State to construct the approach road led to the revision of the deadline for the completion of the project scheduled for December 2008.Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Vijayakumar, accompanied by senior officials of the State and the AAI, is to inspect the terminal and review the progress of the work on Friday.Of the 48.56 hectares needed for the project, the government had handed over 11.15 hectares.

The rallyists, led by S.Veersekharan, Assistant General Secretary, SRMU, presented a petition to the Collector T.Soundiah seeking his intervention in the matter.The union members said apart from the over 7,000 employees in the Golden Rock Central Railway Workshop, thousands of residents of Golden Rock, Ponmalaipatti, Kottapattu, Melakalkandarkottai, Keezha Kalkandarkottai, Nathamadipatti, Keezhakurichi and Thiru Nagar were using the access road to Golden Rock via the G.Corner junction everyday over the past several decades. The area had several schools and the Railway Divisional Headquarters Hospital. Wagons, locos and other raw material to the Railway Workshop have to be moved via the G.Corner Junction.The construction of the four-lane highway has effectively denied them direct access from the Chennai By-pass Road. The entire area has become an island without proper access road.It was unfortunate that the National Highways Authority of India has failed to take into consideration the requirements of the people of the region.

684,Train service between Karur and Chennai sought,Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,02:33:21 IST,"Rail users and commuters from the district have called upon the authorities to introduce a day time train service between Karur and Chennai as also between Erode and Dindigul or Madurai to serve the area public better.Representing the demands the Divisional Rail Users Consultative Committee member A. Shahul Hameed has urged the Railway Minister and the Railway Board to consider their plea positively as the potential needs to be tapped even as the public would be served better through the services sought.Mr. Shahul Hameed pointed out that heeding the public plea for a Chennai-Karur train service, a new express train was introduced between Erode and Chennai from July 1, 2003.Since then it was first extended to Coimbatore and now to Mangalore and Karur travellers and public were finding it difficult to get accommodation in the service and they felt the service was there for them any longer.Karur, which is a bustling business centre, is starved of a day train service to connect the State capital.Though it was almost equidistant from Erode and Tiruchi, Karur train users were feeling the pinch of inadequate train services from the source, he added.It was in these circumstances that the Salem Division was taking steps to introduce a day train service between Erode and Chennai through Salem.Mr. Shahul Hameed observed that if the service were to be operated through Karur, Tiruchi and Villupuram, these areas could be served better. Salem region was already having some day train services to Chennai and the diversion would not be greatly troublesome for that area.Though Karur-Dindigul broad gauge has been in place for a long time now, enough passenger services were not being operated.People residing in areas such Velliyanai, Palayam, Eriyodu and other areas adjoining Karur and who used to come to Karur for work in textile units would be served better with the introduction of a passenger service between Erode and Madurai through Karur and Dindigul.As for the facilities and amenities at the Karur Junction, Mr. Shahul Hameed said that the station was suffering from manpower shortage and issuing of tickets was getting delayed putting commuters to great trouble.Long queues stand for a greater part of the day in front of the only reservation and current booking counter.The eleventh hour rush would be irksome for the public in a hurry to catch trains. Tickets are being issued even after the trains arrived at the platforms, he has noted, calling for appointing more staff.Inadequate drinking water facilities and toilet facilities plague the railway station and efforts to better them have not yielded the desired results so far.Authorities should look into the basic amenities needs of the public as soon as possible, he remarked.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/Train-service-between-Karur-and-Chennai-sought/article16298967.ece

What was needed was a change in its policies.He said it was very unfortunate that the CPI (M) had not learnt lessons from the “Singur debacle”.Land was acquired for the Nano car factory against the wishes of the people. It had now become a “corporate desert” with nothing being cultivated in it.The Nandigram incident that followed Singur clearly showed that the West Bengal government had scant respect for the voice of the people.Similarly, the Maoists who had a bad experience in Andhra Pradesh were rethinking their strategies and looking for an alternative.In Kerala too, the Left party activists and sympathisers were looking for an alternative, he said.Mr. Bhattacharya said that his party did not join hands with the 13 parties that organised the ‘Bharat Bandh' on April 27, but extended support to it independently.Going by the response of the people to the agitation, it was clear that the people were fed up with the policies of the UPA government.But some political parties at the last moment extended support to the Government defeating the cut motions in Parliament, he said.The Left party leader said that the agitation against price rise had become a movement.The CPI (ML) Liberation was demanding food security because there would be no national security without it.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/lsquoRealignment-of-Left-forces-on-the-cards/article16298895.ece

  Visakha Container Terminal (VCT), which developed the country's deepest container terminal here, has achieved a growth of 11.8 per cent during 2009-10 beating the recessionary trend.The annual throughput was close to 1,00,000 TEUs -- the main exports being ferro alloys, aluminium ingots, seafood, minerals, chemicals, granites and garments. The main imports are refractory stuff, machinery and spares, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wood pulp, food and agro products.The advantage with VCT, which is in the process of emerging as an ideal gateway to shipping lines and customers connecting AP and rapidly growing hinterland of North, Central and North India with the overseas markets.VCT is a joint venture between Visakhapatnam Port and DP World and United Liner Agencies (P) Ltd. It commenced the operations in June 26, 2003. The terminal with a natural depth of 16.5 metres alongside can boast of being the only such facility in the country to accommodate the largest container vessel of today at any point of time.The terminal, which handled 11,516 TEUs in March -- the highest volume handled in a month -- has easy access to seven States within a distance of 750 km.“Our terminal is equipped with the necessary infrastructure, including two rail mounted quay cranes, two gantry cranes with rubber tyres and four reach stackers. It uses seamless connectivity for all operations and maintains ISO certified standards for operations, safety and environmental protection,” says VCT COO Capt. Sriram Ravi Chander.A welcome trend is the increase in the size of vessels calling at VCT due to growing hinterland. Vessels with capacities of 3,500 TEUs are now being handled. Currently, there are 48 lines registered with VCT. New lines are also showing interest due to increased importance of the port. Visakhapatnam Port, which is ranked second among all major ports in the country, offers a rebate of 35 per cent on vessel related charges (pilotage and port dues) for main line vessels and 25 per cent for feeder vessels having GRT of more than 27,000 providing vessel operators an impetus to line up more container cargo to Visakhapatnam.“With several projects in the pipeline, huge alumina and steel projects in AP, Chhattisgarh and Orissa, we are confident of registering a phenomenal increase in container traffic.

Rosaiah to come out with something concrete for north Andhra during his recent visit to the place.Talking to media persons here on Thursday, official spokesman of the party J. Prithviraju said that Mr. Rosaiah was not only adept at jugglery of numbers during his State budget presentations over a dozen times, but also had now proved to be a juggler of words.“He was heard saying that since the State's finances were not sound, the government was unable to implement Jalayagnam as well as other welfare schemes, including Arogya Sri. But in Vizag, at the end of his two-day tour, Mr. Rosaiah stated that the State was financially sound and power supply and other welfare schemes were being implemented which came as a surprise,” he said.The BJP leader pointed out that Polavaram project alone would provide the answer to the water woes of the city but the government was not implementing it due to paucity of funds. Similarly, the pruning of seats from 6,000 to 3,000 at IIIT, failure to reimburse fee and release scholarships to backward classes students put the latter's future in jeopardy. “Regarding power from NTPC Simhadri, the 1000 MW it produced was meant for utilisation by Andhra Pradesh when it was commissioned here. Now, another 1,000 MW will be available after its expansion but the government is silent on its utilisation by the State. Also, no funds were released to VIMS Super-speciality hospital and the KGH buildings are in a dilapidated condition, needing renovation,” Mr. Prithviraju noted.He also said that the BJP in its bid to begin preparing for the municipal elections, would conduct a meeting on May 14 for coastal districts at Eluru, on May 15 at Anantapur for Rayalaseema region and on May 21 at Hyderabad for Telangana.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Rosaiahs-visit-disappointing-BJP/article16298888.ece

695,Carbon black plant opposed,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,00:19:55 IST,"Almost all those who attended the environmental public consultation on the Continental Carbon India Limited's 4.2 lakh-tonne carbon black manufacturing industry and a 150 MW captive power plant at Pudi village in Rambilli mandal held at the village on Thursday, opposed setting up the industry as it would damage the environment and deny them livelihood.Joint Collector Pola Bhaskar presided and the Ghaziabad-based company's representatives explained about the plant. The industry is being set up with technical support from the Continental Carbon Limited of the US. Carbon black is used to reinforce the rubber.The first objection was about the brief Telugu version of the environment impact assessment report instead of a detailed report.Representatives of environmental groups, fishermen associations, Dalit organisations and NGOs explained about the damage the industry would cause. A similar industry in the US was closed in the face of opposition from the people after it caused lung cancer, skin diseases, etc.CPI (M) district secretary Ch. Narasinga Rao said no more pollution-causing industries would be allowed in the district. A carbon black making unit of 10,000 tonnes was set up in the district in 1985 but it was closed a year later when people protested. Damage caused by the Pudi unit would be more, he said. The number of jobs would be around 400 and not in thousands as the management claimed, Mr. Narasinga Rao said. Dalitula Bhoomula Hakkula Parirakshana Samiti K. Venkata Ramana dismissed the claim of factory management that the industry would not cause pollution. There was no industry without pollution, he said. Boosi Raju of Maala Mahanadu said the industry would only harm the people.T. Shankar of Traditional Fishermen Forum and another fisherman Bosanna said the industry would pollute the sea more and destroy marine life. Even the salt would get polluted, said Mr. Bosanna. Bhujanga Rao of Forum for Better Visakha strongly opposed setting up the industry as it would cause a lot of pollution.J.V. Ratnam of 100 Months Climate Protection Committee pointed out that one of the raw materials of carbon black was sludge from crude oil refinery units which would cause more pollution.It was banned even in the developing countries.Representatives of Save Nature and Paryavarana Praja Parirakshana Samiti of Hyderabad also opposed.There was some tension during the proceedings when Elamanchili MLA U.V. Ramana Murthy Raju (Kannababu) shouted at those opposing the industry and said they better bother about pollution in Visakhapatnam before trying to block an industry in this area. He stopped his criticism when people strongly protested.Out of the 27 speakers, 20 opposed. The MLA, local Sarpanch and another Congress leader supported and four consultants spoke in favour of the industry.Mr. Bhaskar said that the Government would go by people's opinion and added that if we needed one benefit, we have to lose another advantage.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Carbon-black-plant-opposed/article16298884.ece

Bala Kondala Rao and her troupe returned to the city recently after completing a successful month-long tour of the USA.Giving details to the media, Ms. Bala Kondala Rao said she was overwhelmed by the keen interest of the audiences in knowing about Kuchipudi and its origin apart from enjoying and appreciating the performances. “It is a great honour for me that the organisers of the Cleveland Tyagaraja Aradhana festival, that is being conducted by V.V. Sundaram annually for the past 33 years, has chosen me to perform an exclusive Kuchipudi workshop for the first time,” she said.“Only Bharatanatyam was being performed at the annual festival for the last 33 years. Many students had joined the 10-day workshop at Cleveland.” The tour had started off with a programme under the auspices of GWTCS in Maryland on March 27. Ms. Bala Kondala Rao's younger son Aditya Bulli Brahmam and daughter-in-law Maalyada Anand presented some of Ms. Bala's choreographies. They were supported by Ms. Bala herself on the Nattuvangam, her elder son Anand Srihari on the Mridangam, Ms. Saraswathi Chaitanya on vocal and Mr. Vinjamuri on the violin.The second performance was at the famous Sri Venkateswara Temple at Pittsburg on the next day. Bindu Gutti and Suvarna Pappu, two of the senior most disciples of Ms. Bala had performed along with Maalyada Anand and Aditya. The performance at the Rochester University at Rochester in New York was on the theme ‘Transition of Kuchipudi' from the olden days to the present generation. It showcased items like ‘Sivastakam', ‘Vedalera Vayyalaru', ‘Vachenu Alamelumanga' and ‘Gayati Vanamali'. Ms. Bala's senior most disciples Vidya Aluri and Suvarna Pappu also participated. Roxanne Gupta, an American citizen, performed ‘Bhama Kalapam'. The performance was followed by a question and answer session.“I thought that only a few persons would stay back to clarify their doubts but I was amazed to see not even a single person leaving the packed venue. They asked questions on the art of dance, various styles and Kuchipudi,” said Ms. Bala. The troupe toured 10 states and gave performances and lecture demonstrations. Earlier, president of Rotary Club Elite M.A. Ali recalled the contribution of Ms. Bala Kondala Rao to the promotion of Kuchipudi for which the club had chosen her for the prestigious ‘Award for Professional Excellence'.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Kuchipudi-dance-team-floored-by-response-in-US/article16298883.ece

  While there is an increasing awareness of monuments, destruction of these treasures is also taking place, knowingly or unknowingly, School Education Minister Thangam Thennarasu said on Thursday.Addressing a meeting to distribute certificates to those who underwent an introductory course in Tamil epigraphy, he said it was a cause of concern that stone inscriptions, temple murals and other monuments that had survived hundreds of years were suddenly facing a threat.The course was conducted by the Academy of Archaeology and Sciences of Ancient India (AASAI), the education wing of REACH foundation.“They are not mere stones. Time has been preserved in the stones. Our ancestors protected these monuments despite the socio-political changes and wars. Now, it is our duty to protect and preserve them for the next generation.”“Mere awareness will not serve any purpose,” he said stressing, “We should join our hands to protect the monuments.”Recalling the announcement for creating heritage clubs in schools, the Minister said after the Classical Tamil Conference he would see to it that the task was completed.Noted archaeologist and Director, AASAI, T. Satyamurthy, said the course was to make more people read the inscription so that they would not treat monuments as unwanted material. “Once they are able to read it they will realise what is written on the wall in beautiful Tamil.”S. Rajavelu, Associate Professor, Thanjavur Tamil University, stressed the need for effective co-operation from people to protect monuments. “At least treat temples as a place of cultural importance if not treating them as place of worship.”Ravi Sam, Chairman, AASAI, said the students who underwent the course had already emerged as a watchdog group for protection of monuments.Swami Padmasthananda, secretary, Ramakrishna Mission, and S.

700,Second Thoughts: Come with old Khayyam ,NAVTEJ SARNA,2010-05-06,18:56:53 IST,"The other day, halfway through a virtual conversation, or chat, I found myself unable to recall a much loved rubai of Omar Khayyam. This lapse, unimaginable in one’s youth but part of the daily landscape now, soon had me searching the bookshelves. I was looking for my Omar Khayyam and unconsciously, I was looking for that coverless, disintegrating Jaico edition that I had bought in the mid-1970s for two or three rupees from the booksellers who used to shout “take a look, buy a book” in the corridors of Connaught Place. The book with the tempting sketches of the hedonist resting against a tree and drinking cups of heady wine from the hands of a sinuous saki under a full moon, sketches which, in a summer of artistic delusion, I copied on chart paper and hung all over my room. But that book was nowhere to be found; it has not survived the three dozen years and the dozen or so moves. Instead, I found three other Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, each an embodiment of pure physical beauty. The first, barely the size of a pocket dictionary, has a rich rust-brown cover depicting a medieval garden with intertwining branches, full-bodied roses, singing birds and fruits in the boughs. Each page featuring a single rubai, or quatrain in Persian, is framed like a carpet from the same land. The English version, with 102 rubais cramped into a few pages, is based on Edward Fitzgerald’s translation from the first of his five editions. This edition can be distinguished from the later ones by slight differences in some of the rubais. The most famous of these is: Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough,/A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou…….; in the third and later editions this becomes: A book of verses underneath the bough/A jug of wine, a loaf of bread – and thou…I found this little gem of a book in the bookshop in the gardens of Hafiz’s tomb in Shiraz, where newly-weds come to seek the blessings and a turbaned dervish with deep set eyes and a flowing beard walks around the chai-khanah. The second is a very slim 1955 production that I found tucked away in a second-hand bookstore bursting at the seams. The rubais, once again based on Fitzgerald’s first edition, are all inscribed on dull yellow pages and the remarkable accompanying miniature depictions of hedonistic abandon are in the same yellow and pastel pink. This edition satisfies itself with 75 quatrains and ends with the emblematic signature phrase Tamam Shud or “it is finished.” And the third has nothing miniature about it; it is a large, lush and generous coffee table book entitled The Wine of Nishapur harking to the capital of Khorasan, which once rivalled Cairo and Baghdad and where Khayyam was born in 1048, as well as buried in 1131. This book is based on the belief that in order to fully understand Khayyam, it is not enough to master the Persian language; one has to be Iranian and have “breathed the same air, felt the same spring breeze on his cheeks, enjoyed the same picnic in the meadow…”Using an all-Iranian team, it combines the English rendering of 72 rubais by Karim Emami and the skilful Persian calligraphy of Nasrollah Afje’i with the perceptive photography of the man who has put it all together - Shahrokh Golestan. The photographs are a non-literal, philosophical take on Khayyam- red sunshades of a side-walk café (each Nowruz hold tulip-fashion a bowl of wine), a long shadow of a passerby (whence is the entrance and whereto our exit?), the sun’s last rays on raindrops (the moon will wax and wane over and over again)… Incidentally, nobody quite knows how many rubais Khayyam actually wrote. In the oldest extant manuscript, copied 500 years ago in Shiraz and now held in the Bodleian Library, there are 158. In later versions, succeeding scribes added more until the total swelled to nearly 1200. Edward Fitzgerald culled out the essential ones and rendered them in a free English translation, or as he called it a “transmogrification,” in 1859. He did not pretend to be too faithful to the original, often combining more than one rubai to make a brilliant whole that reads as one poem and not as separate epigrammatic quatrains. Incidentally, there was an Indian connection: his colleague, Prof. Edward Cowell discovered a Persian manuscript of the rubaiyat in the Asiatic Society of Calcutta and sent it to him. The resulting book went almost unnoticed and was soon in the one-penny boxes on the streets until it found admirers in the poets Rosetti and Swinburne (followed by Hardy, Elliot and Conan-Doyle) and went on to become one of the most famous, essential and oft-quoted books for the next 100 years. In his lifetime, Omar Khayyam was known not as a poet but as a philosopher, mathematician and astronomer. It is difficult to believe that his most influential work was a treatise that demonstrated the problems of algebra in which he solved cubic equations through intersecting conic sections; if you don’t understand that, please join the club. He made far-reaching reforms to the Persian calendar, linking it to actual solar transit. He was in fact the precursor to non-Euclidian geometry and to a heliocentric view of the world. In addition, he wrote on mechanics, geography and jurisprudence.It is for this work that the man - who has hundreds of wine-houses named after him - is also commemorated in a lunar crater on the far side of the moon and in a minor planet - 3095 Omarkhayyam - discovered in 1980. One can only conclude that his scientific mind and philosophical bent questioned Divine providence and finding no answers to the perplexities that he encountered, he preferred to focus on the fleeting and sensual pleasures of the material world. Fitzgerald’s rendering of Khayyam’s rubaiyat has eclipsed the other achievements of this remarkable man, at least to the English speaking world, in a manner best expressed by Khayyam himself: 
Indeed the idols I have loved so long

Have done my credit in mens’ eye much wrong;

Have drowned my honour in a shallow cup

And sold my reputation for a song.

703,Staging a change,SANGEETA BAROOAH PISHAROTY,2010-05-06,17:10:30 IST,"Sitanath Lahkar has made his passion blossom. Photo: Anu Pushkarna
  Mathematics is his earning source, theatre his soul. Sitanath Lahkar, professor of mathematics at the prestigious Cotton College in Guwahati, has long been a student of theatre, an ardent advocate of the curative powers of arts, particularly theatre, in a society that is in constant flux. His group, Samahar Natya Goshti, which celebrated its silver jubilee last year, has a repertoire of about 50 plays, all scripted by Lahkar. “I act, direct and write plays. That way, I am a one-man theatre group,” he says in jest.In New Delhi on a private visit, Lahkar languidly reconstructs his initiation into theatre. “No one from my family did plays before me. In 1965, as a school student in Nalbari, I staged a one-act-play. It became a local sensation. I should say that was my starting point.” Having continued his interest in play-acting and play-writing for years, Lahkar came up with the idea of his own troupe in early 1984. “But it got its impetus after theatre activist Safdar Hashmi was killed in 1989. As a group that began with the slogan of theatre with a purpose, we took Safdar's murder as a serious blow to our goal,” he recollects. Soon after, Samahar started street theatre, not just in Guwahati but in remote villages across the North East. “Samahar has 19 street plays. We did about 350 shows then to tremendous response. We were the only group then to do street plays in the region,” he mentions.Lahkar brought his “Kahiyo Sandhi Das” to the 2003 edition of Bharat Rang Mahotsav in New Delhi. He says, “All our plays are about issues touching our society. This play is about surrendered terrorists, termed SULFA. In 1996, when many ULFA cadres surrendered to the Government, they became legalised terrorists. While they got all the Government privileges, they also continued with their armed extortions. It became a new problem in our society.”Among other interesting subjects his plays have dealt with are Assam's student agitation, the serial blasts in Assam, the State's notorious LoC financial scam, the Babri Masjid demolition, communalism, casteism and unemployment.Believes Lahkar, “That serious plays don't attract common people is an utter lie. I have done plays in the interiors, sometimes with just one tube light on, in both bitter cold and scorching summer. I have always got a full house.”In a village called Sokihali in Lower Assam some time ago, he says, “We staged a play in front of 9,000 people. The sound system didn't work for 45 minutes. People waited till it became all right. In yet another place near Nalbari, we performed the play ‘Matir Dheep' in front of 3,000 people with just Petromax lights.”To Lahkar also goes the credit of reviving the memory of Brajanath Sarma, considered the father of the popular mobile theatre in Assam. Sarma was also the first to introduce women actors to the stage. In his memory, every September since 2007, Samahar hosts the Brajanath Sarma Memorial Drama Festival, inviting theatre groups from across the North East and West Bengal. “We do it between September 12, his birth anniversary, and September 15, his death anniversary,” he adds.With a lot of interest, Lahkar informs us that Samahar now has a permanent address. “Finally, we have managed to have a concrete place for our rehearsals. We started off from a cowshed,” he says with a laugh. Paucity of actors, particularly due to lack of money in theatre, he adds, “is a serious problem.”“Most actors in my troupe work elsewhere to run their homes. Often they find it difficult to take out time for rehearsals. It has been a constant problem not just with my troupe but with most in the region. There is hardly any sponsor available. Rabindra Bhavan, the only big auditorium in Guwahati, charges Rs.10,000 for one shift, while we sell tickets to theatregoers for Rs.20 each. It is not easy for theatre groups to survive there,” he points out.Samahar's “Ma Nishada” found a place in the National School of Drama's Octave festival held in Goa last year but Lahkar sums up the conversation stating, “NSD should consider bringing out new plays of new groups from the region to a wider audience every year. But the same troupes keep getting invitations to Bharat Rang Mahotsav year after year.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Staging-a-change/article16298768.ece
704,In Ghalib's skin,DIWAN SINGH BAJELI,2010-05-06,16:49:22 IST,"“In recent years, we have seen several plays and a few serials on Mirza Ghalib. They have caricaturised a great poet by focusing on his relationship with courtesans and their coquetry, Ghalib's drinking and gambling habits interspersed with his popular ghazals. I was pained to see them and decided to project the real personality of the great poet in the context of his troubled personal life and the history and culture of his times. For five years, I studied works by Indian as well as foreign scholars on Ghalib and finally completed the project,” says Charan Das Sindhu, author of 36 plays. “Ghalib-e-Azam,” his latest offering, was premiered at Shri Ram Centre recently under the direction of Ravi Taneja, his son-in-law.
Creative vision
Endowed with a unique creative vision, he writes in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi with equal felicity. His Ghalib is a great poet and a great man who suffered one heartbreak after another and was betrayed by his close relatives. “The death of one child is too much of a shock that breaks one's heart. Ghalib lost seven children when they were in their infancy but he endured all this displaying great fortitude, sharing these deeply tragic moments with his dear wife Umaro Jaan,” says the playwright. “To add to his woes, he had to look after his mentally ill brother — who is said to have been killed by a British soldier during the 1857 revolt.”In “Ghalib-e-Azam,” Sidhu has dramatised three significant events in Ghalib's life — his struggle to get a family pension from his estate Loharu (Rajasthan), his pain at the untimely death of his children and the deep bond with his wife who silently suffered the loss, and his journey to Calcutta and stay in Banaras. Sidhu says he has incorporated into the thematic structure Ghalib's compassion and faith in man despite betrayals, his profound humanism and his contribution to India's tradition of composite culture.To convey the universal relevance of Ghalib's poetry and life, the playwright has devised a chorus which includes references from Charvak philosophy from the Rig Veda, lyrics from Bulle Shah, Kabir, Nanak, Amir Khusrau, Ravi Das and Tulsi Das. The chorus is aimed at reinforcing the humanistic philosophy of the poet. “I believe in Shajjad Zahir's assessment of Ghalib. He said that Ghalib was much, much ahead of his times and was a visionary and a genius to visualise the dawn of a new era which would ensure man freedom and the light of scientific knowledge. I have tried to dramatise all these aspects in a play that runs to two hours and 40 minutes.”A former professor of English at Hansraj College, Sidhu did his MA and Ph.D. from Madison, Wisconsin, in the U.S. and is passionately devoted to theatre. His 33 published plays in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi have been staged and some translated into EnglishA prolific writer, he was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2003 for his play “Bhagat Singh Shaheed: A Trilogy.” His plays could broadly be placed in three categories — plays of social protest, those that critique the educational system and those based on history.Sidhu never uses literary language in his plays. He comments, “I belong to the tradition of Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Munshi Prem Chand. I use the language spoken by the common man and try to capture its vigorous, vivid and effective expression.”What prompted Sidhu to write one play after another for nearly three decades is the encouragement and collaboration of his family. His wife Gyan Kaur played lead roles in most of his plays, his daughters acted too, and now his son-in-law directs and acts in them. In a way, his entire family is his repertory company.Sindhu's plays have evoked keen interest in the academic field. So far, 15 scholars in Punjabi have obtained their Ph. D. degrees on various aspects of Sidhu's works.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/In-Ghalibs-skin/article16298755.ece
705,‘Theatre is my life’,NEEHAR MISHRA,2010-05-06,16:45:21 IST,"Actor Anjan Srivastava. Photo: Mohammed Yousuf
  | Photo Credit: Mohammed_Yousuf He made his mark in theatre and on television when he successfully essayed the role of a typical common man in “Wagle ki Duniya”. With successful tele-serials and films in his kitty, veteran actor Anjan Srivastav is now all set to appear in a cameo in the SAB TV show “Maniben.com”. Here, he talks to us about his long acting career and his future projects.
Could you tell us something about your the character that you are playing on the show?
I play a retired colonel, who is fond of collecting antiques. He is a man of old values and a high temper. He has collected a scooter which belongs to Maniben. The episodes deal with how she tries to get the scooter back from Colonel.I think Smriti is a great actress, one of the best on television. I worked with her previously in “Viruddh”. I have worked before with Contiloe Productions in a few episodes of “Krishna Arjun” and with SAB in “Sahib Biwi Ke Ghulam”. So all three are well connected with me.
For a large part of your acting career, you kept your bank job. How did you manage?
I feel you should just go on doing work. I pursued my acting career and at the same time I did my bank work on the telephone. Fortunately, my chairman gave me all the necessary facilities. I also managed getting good publicity for the bank with my association with actors. I feel I am just doing what's written. And if you wish, you can manage anything.
You are soon to begin shooting for “Detective Wagle”, a sequel to your famous show ‘Wagle ki Duniya'. How is Wagle from “Wagle ki Duniya” different from Wagle in ‘Detective Wagle'?
Wagle is now retired and he wants to do something after that. His wife is still employed and is frustrated with his attitude. He wants to become a detective now and keeps reading detective books. One day he sees an advertisement in the paper about an actress' ring having been stolen. He goes to the police and offers to help find the ring. The police, of course, do not take him seriously because they don't think a retired clerk can be of much help. The show is about how Wagle becomes a detective and tries to solve the case.
Theatre, television, cinema films…Which is your favourite actor's medium?For me, it's theatre, because it has no technical bar. Every performance, every show in theatre has something new, because unlike film or television, it does not capture you in film. I feel that an actor's job is to create, understand and live a character, which is only truly possible in theatre. Theatre is my life. If it dies, so will I.
What are your future plans?I will soon start shooting for “Detective Wagle” and I also have Farah Khan's film “Tees Maar Khan”. I cannot do just any show. For me, the offer has to be up to the mark. Even when it comes to cinema, I like to do only quality films. I am always ready for Raj Kumar Santoshi and Kundan Shah. They are the ones who discovered me and made me what I am. So for them, I am always there. Other than that, I want to see my children well settled in their career.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/lsquoTheatre-is-my-lifersquo/article16298753.ece
706,Of the star-struck,P. ANIMA,2010-05-06,16:42:00 IST,"A scene from the play.
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr taramandal2 “Taramandal” leaves behind a clutch of endearing, enduring images. Amputated ambitions waft through the play, yet keep the mood light. Probably, that's the strength of “Taramandal”. Written and directed by Neel Chaudhuri, the play presented by Tadpole Repertory, recently took home The Hindu MetroPlus Playwright Award. Performed at Akshara Theatre this past week, “Taramandal” boasts some skilful performances, but its bane is its length.Taking off from Satyajit Ray's short story “Patol Babu, Filmstar,” “Taramandal” burgeons into many tales akin to Patol's fate. If Patol's persistent fascination for acting is smothered by a mere exclamation in a movie, he has many comrades in “Taramandal” — a production predominantly in English with a smattering of Bengali and Hindi. Patol's story runs as the linking thread, as many similar tales of ambition, creativity, heartbreak and disappointment unravel along the way. None of them bog you down by the weight of loss — the lines keep laughter close at hand.The play opens with Patol's dream turning into a nightmare — an actor/king robbed of his crown. The sentiment is of an aspirant reaching out to his/her aspiration, yet never finding it within grasp.
Creative disenchantment
“Taramandal” arrests creative disenchantment at different levels. For young Madhav it is not being part of the Beatles musical in school. Reba and Sanjeev thrive in picking up instances from life and enacting them. They merge the idea of the real and the imagined. Acting takes them to realms within themselves, hitherto unknown. So when Sanjeev leaves for Mumbai to dabble in acting, it is his creative chemistry with Reba that dies prematurely.Dushyant tells a familiar tale — of a theatre actor at heart steered to medicine to keep alive family tradition. “There was a genuine effort to convince me that we were the most advanced stage of the species. ‘Doctor man',” he announces to squeals of laughter.Lavanya, a wannabe actress, and Vicky the agent, give a convincing story of many aspiring actors in filmdom. Devika, the Omniphone model, never rises beyond the only contract she has.Amongst this profusion of stories, Patol lingers. He is sketched immaculately, but it is Andrew Hoffland who breathes life into him. He is superbly believable as someone who would listen to Mozart in the dark to fit into the character given to him. His starry gaze and his quiet equanimity even when he knows all he has to say is “Oh!” — all delicately bares Patol.The sets of a few portable boxes and planks work well in “Taramandal.” It evokes a quaint sense of the space, which anyway shifts rapidly. Actors work with military precision after each scene getting in the sets. At times residues and sets from the past scene lingers on giving a sense of the whole. The lights don't play truant either.But “Taramandal,” at close to two hours, suffers, as those part of it loved it too much to trim it. Silence is a potent weapon in a play; it does have a power that words often don't. But in “Taramandal”, silences have been pampered and stretched. Since all sub stories have a similar fate, editing out one, or pruning the tales wouldn't have tampered with the soul. In the crucial scene, where Patol gives the shot of his lifetime, director Aruna Malik sits with her back to the audience. So when she says, “Clap when we're ready, and please don't say “Action” this time,” the exasperation on her face is left to us to imagine.Despite the flaws, “Taramandal” succeeds in delving into nooks of an actor rarely seen.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Of-the-star-struck/article16298756.ece
707,Return of 'Raktharakshas',Sangeeta,2010-05-06,16:17:41 IST,"A scene from the drama 'Raktarakshas'
  | Photo Credit: S.MAHINSHA Nothing seems to move the Malayali like nostalgia does. Song remixes and film remakes have had their due, and now its time for theatre re-runs.Pegging on the memories and emotions of a bygone era, Kalanilayam Drama Vision has re-opened its flagship production, ‘Raktharakshas.' The 30-year old play, directed by Kalanilayam's founder Krishnan Nair and written by Jagathy N. K. Achary, is currently running to full houses in Thiruvananthapuram.
Rooted storyline
The technical finesse and the rooted storyline plus the horror genre can be quoted as obvious reasons for the play's success. Besides there is its landmark invocatory song, ‘Salkaladevi than…,' which has attained a rather anthem-like status.The newer version of the play, which was re-designed to suit the ‘modern taste,' has been cut down to two hours and 40 minutes from the original four-hour duration. The soundtrack was reworked with advanced electronic systems and the scenes re-structured to incorporate dynamic visual effects.“I was aware that the nostalgia factor and the goodwill of the banner will bring in crowds. But Jagathy Sreekumar and I wanted to elevate the play into the contemporary cultural space; hence the efforts to makes changes in the aesthetics. We thus kept the basic storyline intact and re-worked on the external factors. And while incorporating the new additions, we saw to it that we did not go out of form,” says Anantha Padmanabhan, son of Kalanilayam Krishnan Nair.The drama company is currently managed jointly by Jagathy Sreekumar (son of Jagathy N. K. Achary) and Anantha Padmanabhan. The duo decided to revitalise the company in 2003. The original troupe was disbanded after the demise of Krishnan Nair.“We decided to go for a second run as we believed in theatre and its relevance in society. And the movement for us was not a tedious job, but a way of life,” asserts Ananthapadmanabhan, whose mother happens to be one of the oldest actors of Malayalam theatre.“My mother, Kodungallur Amminiyamma, had a close association with Kalanilayam, both as an actor and as the founder's support system. She had immense passion for acting. I remember her telling me about the physical strain she had while performing the play ‘Malabar Lahala.' She was nine months pregnant then. I have been fed and brought up on drama. The same goes for Sreekumar, I believe,” adds Anantha Padmanabhan, who is all set to helm the renaissance of Kalanilayam Drama Vision.The group, which has more than a hundred staff including actors, technicians and ground staff, swears by its manpower.“A play like ‘Raktharakshas' demands concentration, timing and consistency. The effects you see on stage are not computer generated. They are actually physically done by backstage hands. Without such talent and commitment, it wouldn't be possible for us to run the show,” he says.The cast of the ‘Raktharakshas' includes Kavitha in the lead, with Santosh, Sasi, Sukumaran, Thankachan and Sathyan in the supporting roles. The vibrant stage setting has been done by Jagannathan, a long term associate of Kalanilayam. The sound effects are by Jijo and the lighting by Ramchandran and Shijo.“Kalanilayam was once a wonderful treasure house of actors. Veterans such as Aravindaksha Menon were active members of the troupe. Their plays such as ‘Raktharakshas,' ‘Kayamkulam Kochunni,' ‘Elayidathu Rani,' ‘Taj Mahal' and so on banked heavily on actors. It would be great if this new troupe can groom and mould a new set of actors,” hopes R. S. Madhu, a theatre practitioner and a retired school headmaster.
Theatre in the mainstream
Kalanilayam's efforts in pushing theatre back into mainstream comes at the right juncture as the Malayali cultural space is more or less void with cinema entering a crisis and television nearing monotony. And theatre being the most vital form of self-expression, will find its way through in any cultural context.And the evidence? ‘Raktharakshas'; the play with its 30-year-old text and a very conventional stage form, has made it into the minds of the masses minds indicating the changing tastes and sensibilities. Also evident is the Malayali's open mindedness and receptivity towards any work of art done with seriousness and commitment.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Return-of-Raktharakshas/article16298745.ece
708,Endpaper: Tryst with the masters,PRADEEP SEBASTIAN,2010-05-06,19:09:34 IST,"Like everyone in the room I lusted after these books, but was too shy to caress or even touch them. They were beautiful, rare, uncommon. And very expensive. $500 for a book was cheap here. The average price of most of the books I was looking at was $15,000. Several were half a million. Like the fourth Shakespeare folio that beckoned from the window at the Peter Harrington booth. In the next booth was the other legendary antiquarian book seller from London, Bernard Quaritch. They were all here, 200 rare book dealers I had only heard or read about, from London, Paris, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Milan, New York, and San Francisco. They had brought with them the brightest copies of some of the rarest books in the world to show and sell at the 50th New York Antiquarian Book Fair.The fair, sponsored by the ABAA (Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America) is perhaps the most important rare book fair in the world. It takes place every year in April for four days at the Park Avenue Armory, a cavernous stone structure in the heart of Manhattan. For several years now the fair has been organised by Sanford L. Smith and Associates, ‘the foremost arts and antiques show management company'. I might have spent the rest of the fair just gawking at these books without touching them if it wasn't for Angel, a witty, erudite, vivacious young woman at the Bauman's Rare Books booth who simply threw open the closed glass shelves, encouraging me to handle them. She knew the provenance and bibliographical points of these editions intimately. She took out from the shelf a signed and inscribed copy of The Fountainhead, and handed it to me, noting that Ayn Rand had inscribed it to the architect who had helped her research the book. Price: $56,000.
Old friends
Soon, I was handling copies of first printings of books that I had once known only in text book form. In my hand, for instance, was a first edition, first issue of Keats' Endymion, 1818, Octavo, uncut, top edge gilt. A copy that possibly the poet himself may have once touched. A few minutes later, I was holding a signed, inscribed first edition of Forster's A Passage to India, Edward Arnold, 1924, Octavo, original half brown cloth, gray paper spine label. Oscar Wilde's Poems, 1892, signed. (Signed!). I put it back and picked up a copy of A Room of One's Own, Hogarth Press, 1929, limited issue. One of 492 copies signed by Virginia Woolf in her characteristic purple ink. Original cinnamon cloth. I exchanged that for a copy of The Wasteland, signed by Eliot.And just a little later, the book in my hand was the true first edition of Alice in Wonderland, the earliest known edition, preceding the first published London edition, 1866, beautifully rebound with 42 illustrations by John Tenniel. I realised, with a shiver, that I had just touched the very same copies that these authors had held in their hands. I stopped by at Imperial Fine Books to say hello to Bibi Mohammed, special for being one of the few South Asians in the antiquarian world and one of very few bookwomen in the trade. It was a particular treat to meet in person Allen and Patricia Ahearn of Quill and Brush, who put out the definitive book on modern collecting prices, and that renowned contemporary bookwoman, Priscilla Juvelis, specialising in Artists books.I was interested in modern first editions but there were so many dealers with so many bright copies of the high points of modern firsts, that they nearly became commonplace! Only at the New York fair! And most of the copies here were not only in mint condition, they were also signed. First printings of The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, The Hobbit, a whole run of Ian Fleming, Philip K. Dick, Pynchon, Wodehouse, all signed. Bright first issues of The Dharma Bums, Naked Lunch, Moby Dick, Dracula. Advance reading copies of the first Harry Potter book. Anywhere else, these copies would be considered hard to find, but here it was raining high points. At Biblioctopus you could browse through a complete set of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan, dust jackets intact and signed!I went looking for that holy grail of modern first editions: the true first edition of The Great Gatsby, in that scarcest of dust jackets. And found it, naturally, at Between the Covers Rare Books. It was nice to finally meet the folks at BTC, Tom Congalton and Dan Gregory, who put the book in my hands, and explained how this copy had all the points to make it the true first edition. The price? $175, 000. BTC also possessed one of the highlights of the fair: an inscribed first issue of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises in that very, very scarce dustjacket. I was also in search of my own personal holy grail among modern firsts: a signed first edition of The Catcher in the Rye, but no one seemed to possess the grail.However, Ken Lopez Bookseller, another legendary book dealer in modern firsts, sharing the booth with BTC, had, what was at least for me, the next best thing: the first state printing of Salinger's Raise High The Roofbeam Carpenters in the hard to find edition lacking the dedication page. Only 20 or so copies of this state are known to exist in the market. I opened it, saw it lacked the dedication myself, and handed it back, feeling very privileged. In fact, every moment at the fair was a privilege; a bibliographical shock. Peter Harrington had a Shakespeare folio, something I had only seen pictured in catalogues before. And no one seemed to mind when I cautiously took it out of the glass bookcase and carefully, very carefully, turned the pages.
Aesthetic surfeit
By the time I had done just one round of the booths, I had handled books that few people ever see, much less touch: a copy of Origin of Species that Darwin had held, a copy of the New Testament that Martin Luther had used, an illuminated Book of Hours from 1455, incunabula (early printed books before movable type), antique maps, a complete set of Winnie the Pooh, signed by A.A. Milne, original Pooh drawings of E.H. Shephard, the very scare privately printed copy of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit (80, 000 pounds), the very scarce first printing of Don Quixote, the Olympia editions of Lolita, first editions of Kierkegaard's Either/Or and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, signed sets of Kipling, Jane Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Flaubert, Sylvia Plath, and issues of the Strandmagazine in which the Sherlock Holmes stories had first appeared.It was enough to make any bibliophile swoon. I decided to leave before I actually fainted from so much aesthetic shock and ecstatic bookishness. But I was going to return of course, with two more days of the fair, I couldn't resist. As I walked out, I looked at what I had bought: several lavish and beautifully illustrated book catalogues. It was all I could afford at the New York Antiquarian Book Fair.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/pradeep_sebastian/Endpaper-Tryst-with-the-masters/article16123614.ece

711,People welcome verdict with firecrackers,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,23:29:37 IST,"Mumbai citizens burst firecrackers, distributed sweets and relived memories of the November 26, 2008 massacre as soon as they heard the order on Thursday of the Special Sessions Court sentencing Kasab to death by hanging. Crackers went off in South Mumbai in the predominantly Muslim areas of the city, and people carried placards welcoming the verdict. Various groups came out on the street with banners and posters, passing sweets around.At Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), where Kasab and Abu Ismail wreaked havoc, crackers were burst to welcome the verdict. People queued up to pay homage at the memorial to victims. Right from 10-year-old Devika Rotawan, who was a witness, to Kavita Karkare, wife of the killed police officer Hemant Karkare, families of victims and survivors have been demanding death for Kasab for that night of horror which claimed 166 lives.For Assistant Police Inspector Hemant Bowdhankar, this was the day he was waiting for ever since he helped in the capture of Kasab. Mr. Bowdhankar was part of the police team from D B Marg police station which stopped Kasab and Abu Ismail at Chowpatty as they drove up in a stolen silver Skoda on the night of November 26, and engaged them in a short gun battle.The Mumbai police will always remember the sacrifice of policeman Tukaram Ombale who fell to Kasab's bullets that night. The death sentence has vindicated somewhat his sacrifice, feel the policemen. Mr. Bowdhankar told TheHindu: “I was expecting the maximum punishment for Kasab. Everyone did a good job of giving evidence and the truth was what made the difference. We all welcome this judgment.”Another policeman, who was part of this team and who does not wish to be named, says that this is a judgment that should make all Indians proud. It was the result of teamwork of the Mumbai police, and the Indian judiciary showed the world how it could conduct a fair trial. This is a moment to feel proud of our judiciary as well, he said.However, Ms. Karkare, while welcoming the death sentence, was disappointed that two persons were acquitted in this case. Kasab should not be given an opportunity to go to the Supreme Court and his sentence should be executed immediately, she added.Vaishali Ombale, daughter of Tukaram Ombale, expressed fears that the punishment would be delayed. She, like many other families of victims, called for a speedy end to the whole thing.
“Fit punishment”
Vishnu Zende, the announcer at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) who repeatedly made announcements asking people to clear the station that night, was happy. “I saw what Kasab did that day at CST and this is a fit punishment. Nothing less would have done. We are all very happy to hear this verdict,” he said.The government too welcomed the death sentence for Kasab. Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal and State Home Minister R.R. Patil praised the judiciary and Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, and said there must be no delay in executing Kasab's death sentence.Mr. Chavan said the verdict reflected the public sentiment. The trial was fair and democratic and ended within a year. He complimented judge M.L. Tahaliyani and also senior police officials, Rakesh Maria, Deven Bharati and the Mumbai police for the way in which they handled this case.Mr. Patil said India was a soft target for terrorists and this judgment should send a strong signal to the world that terrorism would not be tolerated. Considering the gravity of charges against Kasab, that of waging war against India and murder, it could be nothing less than the death sentence. Given the brutality of the attack, the punishment seemed less, he said.Mr. Patil once again said that all those convicted who were in Pakistan must be brought to India and the world community must bring pressure on Pakistan to do so. Responding to newspaper reports that the State had no hangman, Mr. Patil said the government would find one.He said the government would appeal to the Centre to fast track the legal procedure so that there was no delay in executing the sentence. In regard to the acquittal of the two Indians in the case, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, Mr. Patil said the government would file an appeal against it in the High Court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/People-welcome-verdict-with-firecrackers/article13637475.ece

714,India among the worst 10 climate polluters: study,IANS,2010-05-06,10:39:52 IST,"A man rows his makeshift raft in the polluted Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad. File photo: AP.
  India figures among the world’s worst 10 countries causing environmental damage, according to a new study which lists Brazil as the most polluting country.The research led by professor Corey Bradshaw, of the University of Adelaide’s environment institute, has placed India at seventh position while ranking the US and China as the largest carbon producers after Brazil.The 10 countries with the worst global footprint were Brazil, the US, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru, it said.Countries were measured on a range of indicators, including fertiliser use, natural forest loss, habitat conservation, fisheries and other marine captures, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat.The study, published in the science journal PLoS ONE on Wednesday, found Australia’s carbon emissions, rate of species threat and natural forest loss were the greatest contributors to its ninth—place ranking, according to The Age.“If you’re clearing a lot of forests, you tend to also to overharvest in the ocean and use a lot of fertilizers,” Prof. Bradshaw said explaining the link between development and environmental damage.He said finding the US and China in the top 10 were not surprising, though he was surprised that a relatively poor country such as Brazil took out the top spot.“The wealthier you are, the more damage you do, on average,” he said. “It’s just a function of human nature. Growth is the be—all and end—all for all economies around the world, and if you’re not growing economically, you’re stagnant, and therefore that’s a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that’s unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Prof. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Prof. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Prf. Bradshaw said the better—ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven’t wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we’d consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/India-among-the-worst-10-climate-polluters-study/article16298674.ece
715,U.S. tightens no-fly rule after Shahzad’s near escape,PTI,2010-05-06,10:38:36 IST,"After Times Square bombing plot suspect Faisal Shahzad managed to pass through several layers of security at the New York airport to board a Dubai-bound flight, only to be stopped minutes before take off, the U.S. has tightened its no-fly rules for airlines.The new rules, enforced yesterday by the Transportation and Security Administration, came within two days of Shahzad’s fleeing attempt.The Pakistan-born U.S. national boarded a Emirates flight, even though his name was added to the no-fly list of the United States on Monday.Under the new regulation, airlines now have to check the government’s no-fly list within two hours, which was earlier 24 hours, after they are notified that a name has been added.“It’s being done because a review of the situation finds that an airline is required every 24 hours to check the no-fly list. The suspect’s name was entered a little after noon, I believe, on Monday, therefore, though on the no-fly list, the airline didn’t have to check necessarily at that point,” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said at his daily news briefing.“The new rules require that to happen at a two-hour interval if airlines are notified that somebody’s been added as a risk to the no-fly list,” he said, adding the reason there were redundancies in the system to ensure that there are many mechanisms that would allow one to prevent somebody from flying, which is what happened in this case.“The CBP (Custom and Border Patrol) takes a locked manifest, that’s required to be filed 30 minutes before a flight, with people that are on the plane. That was checked against that list and the individual was removed from the plane,” Gibbs said.Shahzad nearly escaped arrest with only around 20 minutes left for take-off and planes gates closed but the tide turned later - the gates were reopened and he was arrested.The Pakistani-American was placed on the expedited no-fly list Monday at 12:30 afternoon.Seven hours later at about 7:30 pm, he was able to purchase a one-way ticket to Pakistan all by cash. The flight was scheduled to leave at 11:45 pm.“In his case, the airline seemingly didn’t check the name, and the suspect was allowed to purchase a ticket and obtain a boarding pass,” a senior administration official told The Washington Post.“Under the new measure, the airline would be required to re-check the list within two hours of being notified of a special circumstance expedited no-fly name,” the official was said as quoting by the daily.However, Emirates Airlines in a statement said it “fully cooperated with and responded immediately to all local and federal authorities on all matters” related to the flight in question.The airlines also said it is fully compliant with all US passenger check-in procedures and works closely with the US government “to update security watch lists on a regular and timely basis.”Meanwhile, a group of Democratic Senators urged the US President Barack Obama to issue an executive order that all airlines would automatically have to alert the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) if a passenger seeks to buy an airline ticket with cash.Senators Benjamin L Cardin, Charles E Schumer and Mark Udall said the new policy would bolster airline security until the end of the year, when airlines’ responsibility for checking passenger manifests against the no-fly list is scheduled to shift entirely to the TSA.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/U.S.-tightens-no-fly-rule-after-Shahzadrsquos-near-escape/article16298678.ece

Do it in a phased manner. To say we don't have funds and we can't do it is not the answer. What could be a greater need than protecting human lives? You need Government of India funds and till then you can't set up shelters? How can the Chief Secretary say like this in an affidavit? Do you know how your State will be painted in the eyes of the world?”The Bench said: “I am sure the Chief Minister has not seen the affidavit. Otherwise, this type of affidavit will not be filed. The entire country is on one side and you are on the other. You file a better affidavit after it is vetted by the Chief Minister.”The Bench, in its brief order, lauded the steps taken by Andhra Pradesh and Delhi for formulating a comprehensive scheme for providing shelter to the homeless.

  | Photo Credit: Damian Dovarganes Google Monday snapped up a top Canadian startup which pioneered a 3D interface technology for Mac and Windows PCs.Called Canada's hottest software startup, Toronto-based BumpTop has been acquired by the search engine for reportedly between $30 and $45 million, according to reports. However, there were no details of the deal by the two sides.Set up just three years ago, BumpTop has pioneered touch-screen software that allows use of multiple fingers at a time on a multiple touch screen.Called ‘desktop workspace,’ the software allows users to organise pictures, documents and videos much more intuitively. Users can perform many functions with their fingers, including dragging of items into docks, and playing around with photos on desktop.Though Google has not specified how its will use this pioneering technology, it is certain that it will use touch-screen software in its smart phones based on its Android operating system.Since its Android operating system is basically geared for touch-screen technology, rather than keyboard technology, Google's mobile market strategy is aimed at taking on Apple's iPhone and iPad that use touch screen technology.The acquired Toronto company will no longer sell its software independently after May 7.In a statement on its website Monday, it said, “Today, we have a big announcement to make: we're excited to announce that we’ve been acquired by Google! This means that BumpTop (for both Windows and Mac) will no longer be available for sale. Additionally, no updates to the products are planned.”The acquisition of BumpTop is the fifth such deal by the Mountain View-based Google within a month as part of its strategy to take on Apple.Just last week, it had acquired Labpixies that develops social games for mobile services and Facebook. Agnilux, Plink, and Episodic are the other three acquisitions made by Google within a month.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/Google-acquires-3D-software-pioneer-to-take-on-Apple/article16298798.ece

Ahead of Apple's iPad coming on the block analysts predicted pain for Amazon.“We're quite comfortable having a diverse range of physical retailers, whereas most of the other players would like to have a less competitive space, because they'd like to dominate,'' said a Google official.Google confirmed to the BBC that Google Editions would not be affected by the firm's present legal troubles over trying to digitise millions of out-of-print books.“Plans for Google Editions will happen independent of whatever the settlement agreement is,'' said a Google's official.The search giant's efforts to create the world's biggest digital library have been mired in legal action for the last couple of years.Critics have long claimed Google's deal with U.S. publishers and authors would give them a monopoly over online book sales.Google said it would make “millions of books searchable via the web''A ruling on the issue is due soon. — © BBC News/Distributed by the New York Times Syndicate",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Google-enters-digital-book-war/article16298858.ece

This can be easily crossed especially in case the Kurdish parties, strong in northern Iraq, support the merger.Analysts say consolidation of these factions is a victory for Iran which is highly influential among the Shia formations in Iraq.The Iraqi National Movement or Iraqiyah, headed by former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, slammed the formation of the new Shia coalition as a move to isolate his party. The Iraqiyah party had won 91 seats, the highest among any single formation which contested the March 7 elections.Apart from achieving a simple majority, the Shia bloc has to cross two remaining hurdles. First, it has to agree on its choice of a new Prime Minister. Observers say that the chances of Mr. Maliki getting a second term are slim because of the stiff opposition to his name by the 40-seats strong group led by Shia cleric Moqtada Al Sadr. The former Prime Minister, Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, Adil Abdul Mahdi, currently Vice-President, and Baqir Jabr are the other heavyweight contenders for the post.Second, the Shia parties are debating the incorporation of the Iraqiyah formation, which has wide support among the large Sunni minority, in a new national unity government. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, headed by Ammar al-Hakim, which is part of the new Shia super-coalition, has been insisting on the inclusion of “other national forces” in the new government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Iraqs-major-Shia-blocs-to-merge/article16298855.ece

  Millions of undecided voters held the fate of Britain's political leaders on Thursday as polling was held for the most closely-contested general election in a generation with opinion polls pointing to a hung Parliament while giving the Tories sufficient edge to be able to form a minority government.Tory chief David Cameron, accompanied by his heavily-pregnant wife Samantha, was the first of the three main party leaders to vote and the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg the last. His wife, Miriam, accompanied him to the polling station but was not able to vote because she is a Spanish national.On what could be his last day as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown looked remarkably cheerful as he briskly walked into the polling booth with his wife Sarah and warmly greeted journalists and party supporters gathered outside. After a gruelling campaign, all three leaders travelled to their constituencies to cast their votes.Mr. Brown ended his campaign with an emotional appeal to disenchanted Labour voters to “come home'', while his two rivals called for “change'' after 13 years of Labour rule with Mr. Cameron urging voters not to let “fear triumph over hope'' and Mr. Clegg saying people had an opportunity to ‘change Britain forever''.With as many as 40 per cent of voters said to be undecided all parties were able to claim that there was still everything to play for. The tension was, especially, palpable in the 100-odd key marginal seats where a swing of a few hundred votes could make the difference.Tories, in particular, invested heavily in Labour marginals, some held by leading Labour figures, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Ed Balls, Schools Secretary and one of Mr. Brown's close confidants.
Late surge
Labour claimed a late surge of support among women voters in marginal constituencies saying the election would be decided “around kitchen tables and in living rooms''. Lib Dems' hopes of snatching a number of marginal Labour and Tory seats appeared to fade after failing to sustain the momentum they had gained on the back of Mr. Clegg's barnstorming performance during the leaders' television debates.Polling would close at 10 p.m. (local time) and first results are expected around midnight though a clear picture is not likely to emerge until late Friday morning.No official figures for voter turnout were available at the time of going to the press.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/U.K.-elections-on-a-knife-edge/article16298851.ece

We have consistently shared our concerns with the US on supply of military equipments to Pakistan by it.“We have always drawn the U.S.’ attention and cautioned it about our past experience which shows that it has always been used against us.

  Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a tough test on Sunday, when almost a quarter of Germans go to the polls after this week’s decision to bail Greece out with billions of euros of government—backed loans.On May 9, voters in North Rhine—Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, will be asking how to fill the gaping holes in city budgets as they elect a new regional parliament — while Greece stands to benefit from Germany’s perceived generosity.The majority of Germans oppose the Greek bailout, of which Merkel has pledged the lion’s share, fuelled by a media campaign portraying Greeks as corrupt, lazy and undeserving of German aid.Eight months into Ms. Merkel’s second term, the vote is also a key hurdle for the coalition between her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP), whose popularity has plummeted during their time in office.North Rhine—Westphalia’s 13.5 million voters have frequently set the future course for German federal politics.If the state’s current CDU—FDP government is ousted on Sunday, it would cost Ms. Merkel her slender coalition majority in the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house of parliament representing the federal states, making it tougher to push through promised economic liberalization.Opinion polls show no clear favourites in North Rhine—Westphalia, traditionally a Social Democrat (SPD) stronghold, after an election campaign dominated by such issues as school reform and financial shortages.The reputation of state premier Juergen Ruettgers, of Ms. Merkel’s CDU, was tarnished by a funding scandal when it emerged earlier this year that a party official was offering private meetings with him in return for cash.His main challenger, the SPD’s Hannelore Kraft, is little—known beyond North Rhine—Westphalia, where the 48—year—old hopes to become the state’s first female premier after a rapid rise within her party.Greece’s request last month for a eurozone and International Monetary Fund bailout could not have come at a worse time for Ms. Merkel, who has been widely accused of trying to put off the unpopular decision until after the North Rhine—Westphalia election.The chancellor has since been at pains to convince voters that a Greek bailout was the best move for Germany. After cabinet gave the go—ahead on Monday, Ms. Merkel hurriedly convened a press conference and gave a series of television interviews.“A stable European currency has an incredibly high value,”the chancellor said, justifying the rescue package with the “emergency situation“that Greece found itself in.Asked on television whether she feared a voter backlash at the weekend, Ms. Merkel insisted the real question was whether the government had done everything to save the stability of the euro and protect German interests.“I think this question can be answered with a clear ‘yes’ — and I think the people know that,”the chancellor added.If Ms. Merkel does not receive the hoped—for backing at the polls, this could set a worrying signal, in a state seen as a bell—weather for German federal politics.In 2005, Ruettgers led the CDU back to power for the first time there in 39 years, forming a coalition with the FDP which was a forerunner of the coalition at federal level last year.According to opinion polls, the governing coalition is neck—and— neck with the alternative pairing of Social Democrats and Greens, who governed North Rhine—Westphalia until their national government fell out of favour with voters.However, neither the CDU—FDP nor SPD—Greens looks likely to win the necessary majority to govern. One alternative could be a CDU coalition with the Greens, testing the waters for a possible replication at federal level.Alternatively, the SPD and Greens could bring the radical Left Party into the fold — a move seen by many as a political taboo, due to the Left’s roots in the former East German communist state party.The SPD’s Kraft has repeatedly insisted that the Left Party is “neither able to form a coalition, nor to govern” — although they consistently poll above the five—per—cent hurdle required for parliamentary representation.Sunday will also be a vote of confidence for Ms. Merkel’s coalition partner, FDP leader Guido Westerwelle. His popularity has plummeted since he came into power, and the tax cuts at the core of the party’s manifesto are threatened by financial shortfalls.The state premier, Ruettgers, was the first prominent member of the government coalition to suggest that the Greek bailout could have =an additional knock—on effect on proposed tax cuts in Germany.On Thursday, the government publishes its detailed estimate of tax income, giving a clear picture of the country’s financial health.In North Rhine—Westphalia, where councils are struggling with huge debts, this is likely to fuel further questions ahead of Sunday’s election about the billions flowing to Greece.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lsquoGreece-bailout-casts-shadow-over-key-German-electionrsquo/article16298671.ece
733,Nigerian President Yar’Adua passes away after long illness,DPA,2010-05-06,08:25:08 IST,"Nigerian President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, has died after a long illness, according to his office in Abuja. Segun Adeniyi, chief press secretary to Yar’Adua, confirmed that the President died about 9 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Wednesday in Abuja.Mr. Yar’Adua, 58, had been suffering from a heart ailment since November, which necessitated his seeking treatment in Saudi Arabia and Vice President Goodluck Jonathan assuming office as acting president.A former governor of the northern state of Katsina, Mr. Yar’Adua was elected president in 2007 following controversial general elections.His term was dominated by speculations over his health, as he has suffered a chronic kidney condition for at least 10 years.In the last three years, Mr. Yar’Adua has twice been flown to Germany for emergency treatment and visited hospitals in Saudi Arabia.In February, Mr. Jonathan became acting president following Mr. Yar’Adua’s three-month absence as a result of pericarditis, an inflammation of the lining of the heart.Mr. Jonathan, 52, was elevated from vice-president on February 9 by the Nigerian National Assembly in Yar’Adua’s absence.Yar’Adua, 58, had not been seen in public since November, when he went to a Saudi hospital for treatment of the heart. He departed without invoking constitutional measures to temporarily hand over power, leaving Nigeria with a political and legal vacuum.After both chambers of the legislature voted to install Mr. Jonathan as acting president, Mr. Yar’Adua returned to Nigeria and reoccupied the presidential palace but remained out of sight.Mr. Yar’Adua was a Muslim from northern Nigeria, while Mr. Jonathan is a Christian from southern Nigeria.In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences for the death of Mr. Yar’Adua, in a White House statement.“We remember and honour President Yar’Adua’s profound personal decency and integrity, his deep commitment to public service, and his passionate belief in the vast potential and bright future of Nigeria’s 150 million people,” Mr. Obama said.He praised Mr. Yar’Adua’s work “to promote peace and stability in Africa through his support of Nigerian peacekeeping efforts as well as his strong criticism of undemocratic actions in the region. He was committed to creating lasting peace and prosperity within Nigeria’s own borders, and continuing that work will be an important part of honouring his legacy.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Nigerian-President-YarrsquoAdua-passes-away-after-long-illness/article16298747.ece
734,India Post is on Twitter,Sandeep Joshi,2010-05-06,22:32:52 IST,"The Department of Posts, one of India's oldest establishments, has become the first government organisation to be on the social networking site Twitter. Tilted ‘PostOfficeIndia,' the DoP's page already has around 200 followers, from both India and abroad, in less than two months of its operations.As part of its new business strategy, the DoP wants to leverage this unique medium to promote its business, as is being done by leading food chains and other firms in the U.S. and Europe. Though some senior DoP officials are currently managing the web page, soon it plans to have a dedicated team of people to answer queries of followers and paste latest promotions and programmes of the department. It also plans to have sub-categories for various users such as business users, foreigners and have posts State and region-wise.It all began with the DoP posting information about new schemes for users. It posted links to its website telling users how they could calculate postage tariffs or know pin codes of their respective areas. Then recently, the DoP launched SMS tracking facility for Speed Post shipments and told people how they could make use of it.Similarly, through Twitter, the DoP has already started an awareness campaign for India's biggest-ever stamp show that will be held in Delhi next February. It has also been sending messages to people who want to partner DoP in various projects or apply for some tender. Followers have also been making complaints and giving feedback about how to improve the functioning of the department.DoP's Twitter page is also proving to be a boon for those who pursue philately as a hobby, as it has been informing people about limited edition stamps that India Post issues from time to time. “Welcome to the amazing world of the great magician P.C. Sorcar” read a ‘tweet', asking people to get India Post's commemorative postage on the magician. Through another message – India Post greets you on Earth Day! Let's spare a thought for the future of the planet. Let's all join to put together sustainable lifestyles — it is trying to send social messages and connect with those on Twitter.Senior DoP officials are excited by the initial response from its followers. “Wow, Indian Post is on twitter...that's great to hear” wrote one Indian follower, while a few foreign nationals have also shown interest in India Post's Twitter postings. The DoP has been taking special initiatives for foreigners. For instance, during the recent Pushkar festival in Rajasthan, which is very popular among foreigners, it informed tourists about the post office near the fair where special arrangements were made for sending mails and parcels, which received good response.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/India-Post-is-on-Twitter/article16298859.ece

  | Photo Credit: Pat Wellenbach It may look like a piece of gel but it’s a new nano-based telecom technology “enabler” that can make computers and the internet hundreds of times faster.The technology, that may be in use only five or 10 years in the future, is being designed by Koby Scheuer of Tel Aviv University's (TAU) School of Electrical Engineering.Mr. Scheuer has developed a new plastic-based technology for the nano-photonics market, which manufactures optical devices and components. His plastic-based “filter” is made from nanometre (a billionth of a metre) sized grooves embedded into the plastic.When used in fibre optics cable switches, this new device will make our communication devices smaller, more flexible and more powerful, he says.“Once Americans have a fibre optics cable coming into every home, all communication will go through it - telephone, cable TV, the Internet,” adds Mr. Scheuer.“But to avoid bottlenecks of information, we need to separate the information coming through into different channels. Our polymeric devices can do that in the optical domain - at a speed, quality and cost that the semi-conductor industry can't even imagine,” Mr. Scheuer says.In the next decade, fibre optic cables that now run from city to city will feed directly into every individual home. When that technology comes to light, the new plastic-based switches could revolutionise the way we communicate.“Right now, we could transmit all of the written text of the world though a single fibre in a fibre optics cable in just a few seconds,” says Mr. Scheuer.“But in order to handle these massive amounts of communication data, we need filters to make sense of the incoming information. Ours uses a plastic-based switch, replacing hard-to-fabricate and expensive semi-conductors.”Semi-conductors, grown on crystals in sterile labs and processed in special ovens, take days and sometimes months to manufacture. They are delicate and inflexible as well, Mr. Scheuer explains.“Our plastic polymer switches come in an easy-to-work-with liquid solution. Using a method called ‘tamping,’ almost any lab can make optical devices out of the silicon rubber mould we've developed.”His biggest hurdle, says Mr. Scheuer, is in convincing the communications industry that polymers are stable materials.“There is a lot of prejudice in this industry against plastics. But this approach could take us to a new level of communication,” the researcher says, according to a TAU release.He also notes that the process is not much different from the way that mass numbers of DVDs are produced in a factory - except Mr. Scheuer works on a nano, not a “giant” micro, scale.His device can also be used in the gyros of planes, ships and rockets; inserted into cell phones; and made a part of flexible virtual reality gloves so doctors could “operate” on computer networks over large distances.These findings were published in Optics Express.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/New-fibre-optics-technology-to-speed-up-internet/article16298792.ece

738,Nagin (1954),Vijay Lokapally,2010-05-06,17:05:26 IST,"It used to be one of the favourite pastimes of the summer vacations. The kids would wait for the snake charmer to arrive and play his mesmerising flute, gradually lifting the cover of his basket to unveil a lethal reptile, its hood greeting the motley gathering to a session of music and dance.As the flute's captivating notes came wafting through, the children would gather under the tree, the girls instantly transformed into intrepid ballerinas, the snake happily forgotten…The kids, swaying to the flute, held centre stage, and only when the reptile hissed angrily would the snake charmer dismiss the enthusiastic young group. The music, and not the snake, remained etched in memory.
Charming tune
It was only many summers later that one learnt the tune was not his original work. It came from a movie called “Nagin.” The tune, created by Hemant Kumar, became the theme for all snake charmers. The man playing the charming been (flute) in Hemant Da's orchestra was Kalyanji, who later joined hands with Anandji to form a highly successful team of composers. You could hear this immortal composition across the country.It is said that when “Nagin” was released, snake charmers entertained the crowd outside the cinema halls during the intermission. It is also said that some theatre owners would engage these snake charmers to keep an eye just in case the tune from inside the hall ‘attracted' a reptile in the neighbourhood.One had heard of a movie hall in Hyderabad being host to an unwelcome ‘guest' during the screening of “Nagin.”
Strength of music
Coming to the storyline, there is nothing exceptional about “Nagin”. Mala (Vyjayanthimala) and Sanatan (Pradeep Kumar) belong to warring tribes and fall in love when she is entranced by his been. The movie progresses on the strength of its music as the two lovers, confronting opposition in various forms, are separated before uniting in a climax that includes five songs in a row.The closing segment of the movie is shot in colour, but it is the black-and-white portion that stands out for Hemant Da's music and Vyjayanthimala's performance.The ethereal Vyjayanthimala, barely 18, illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty, moving around daintily from one song to the other; from the bewitching “Man Dole Mera Tan Dole” to the poignant “Mera Dil Ye Pukare Aaja…” Of course, the soul of the movie remains Lata Mangeshkar's voice and Hemant Da's unforgettable composition to some impeccable lyrics by Rajinder Krishan. Simply unmatched…There are only a few movies that can be counted for their musical score, and “Nagin” remains one of them. When Lata sings “Jadugar Sainyya Chhodo Mori Bainyya” and Vyjayanthimala responds with her dancing skills, the result is sheer magic on the screen. The close-up shots of Vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effort.“Nagin” was a precursor to her rise in Hindi cinema as an iconic actor, who combined her talents, performing and dancing, to rule the screen on her terms.There are a couple of nondescript numbers too, ironically sung by Lata, but tolerable compared to some mediocre stuff that symbolises music today.Hemant Da's contribution to the movie is monumental. He gets the best out of Lata and then lends his voice to an unforgettable duet “Arre Chhod De Sajaniya Chhod De Patang Meri Chhod De”, apart from the solos that have stood the test of time: “Tere Dwaar Khada Ek Jogi”; “Yaad Rakhna Pyaar Ki Nishani Gori Yaad Rakhna” and “Zindagi Ke Dene Wale Zindagi Ke Lene Wale…”The two biggest recall values of “Nagin” are Vyjayanthimala and Hemant Da. The director is Nandlal Jashwantlal; there is a cameo by I.S. Johar; the villain is Jeevan and the hero is Pradeep Kumar; it was a huge hit and fittingly fetched Hemant Da the Filmfare Award. In small towns, it was common to see a man guarding snake baskets outside the theatre screening “Nagin”, for the charmers would all be inside. A pity the snake charmer has vanished in these times, but the charm of “Nagin” has only grown….",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Nagin-1954/article16298764.ece
739,Obsession with marriage,ANUJ KUMAR,2010-05-06,16:58:35 IST,"Director Gurinder Chadha
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr gurinder new Most of the times we find Hindi film heroines are presented as the epitome of beauty. Gurinder Chadha tinkers with this deep-rooted stereotype, which has social ramifications, in “It's A Wonderful Afterlife”, a Chadha comedy releasing this Friday. If the title gives a backhand compliment to Frank Capra's classic, Chadha says the form flirts with the Ealing comedies, the lightly satirical films which depicted British society in the post World War II period. “I have also put an element of ghost. Horror-comedies are common in Britain, but Indian audience have not experienced the genre. Also, in British films we hardly find British Indian characters. I felt the need for both, and we have a ‘masala' film, which has comedy, ghosts, tragedy and reincarnation with a social comment underneath,” says Chadha, who established herself as the voice of the Diaspora with films like “Bhaji On The Beach” and “Bend It Like Beckham”.
Indian obsession
At the heart of the story is the Indian obsession with marriage dealt with in a light-hearted fashion. “Mrs. Sethi is a typical Punjabi woman that we see on the road but hardly ever try to delve into the story of such fat dames. She has a well-rounded daughter, who is not beautiful in the traditional sense. Frustrated after her repeated attempts to get her married, Sethi kills the people who refused her. Interestingly, the ghosts of four such people help her out in finding a groom for her daughter in return for reincarnation.” She says the thought of reincarnation by doing a good deed lends a moral fibre to the film and therein lies the link with Capra's “It's A Beautiful Life”.Chadha assures us she hasn't fallen for the typical solutions that the girl loses weight in the second half and turns into a swan. “Here the character Roopi is ultimately accepted as she is…only her dress sense changes a bit. The filmmakers need to understand that we have a lot of well-rounded women around and they make perfect brides and mothers. In India you will find such ladies in almost every household. The filmy representation is responsible for creating unnecessary pressure on girls to be skinny leading to an unhealthy lifestyle.”Shabana Azmi plays Mrs. Sethi and Chadha says the actress didn't read the script before accepting the offer. “Like many, I also had a serious image of her in my mind but when I met her with Javed Akhtar during the shooting of ‘Bride and Prejudice', I saw the lighter side of her. There I made up my mind to offer her a central role in one of my films. Mrs. Sethi is a complex character. It is not one of those roles where she had to look inside. On one hand it is over the top, as she is interacting with ghosts, which only she could see, all the time, and on the other, there is a tragic underpinning to her character. Only she could have made it look authentic. Those who have seen the film in Britain have called it an Indian Bridget Jones.”Chadha says this time it was different for Shabana, known for her intense preparation for a role. “She didn't know my kind of humour. It was only when she landed in London that she got an idea. I made her watch some Ealing comedies and then she got the hang of things. She observed the gait, walk and accent of Punjabi women in South Hall and incorporated it so well into the character that when curious people trooped in on the sets looking for Shabanaji, they were unable to identify her.”The film also marks Chadha's association with an Indian production house, Studio 18. There is a growing acceptance for her kind of cinema where culture is used as a tool to transcend boundaries. “Coming from a mixed parentage, growing up in London and married to a Japanese American, I understand the problems of the Diaspora better than many others. British people might not identify with the Indian obsession with marriage, but Italians, South Africans and Chinese would. This has happened with most of my films. People have been able to identify with the characters despite cultural barriers on the surface.” Chadha says during her growing up years she missed Asian characters on television and films. “So when I got an opportunity, I attempted to make them mainstream.” Now when she has succeeded, she wants to have fun with it.
Hindi version
The Hindi version of the film is called “Hai Marjawaan”, but if the past is a parameter, the chances don't look too bright as the dubbed version of “Bride And Prejudice” didn't find many takers. “‘Bride And Prejudice' was not essentially made for a Hindi film audience. It was a way to introduce American audiences to Bollywood song and dance and it achieved that goal. I have seen young American girls still dancing to songs of the film in Bollywood night parties. “Hai Marjawaan” is very much my film. It has much more to appeal to the Indian audience, as apart from the theme the comic lines and gags have an Indian touch.”Chadha is now working on a children's film set in Kerala with lots of elephants around. “I believe kids' films have lost their innocence. These days I find them a lot more knowing. Perhaps producers want to reach out to the entire family. The kids of today are much more exposed to the media and perhaps they get the inherent meaning, but do they need to? I want to make it just for kids. Then there is a film on the Indian Freedom Movement from a British Indian perspective.” Is she ready to rub some Indians the wrong way? “Well, every good film does that. Otherwise filmmaking will become a very bland process. It is still early days, but the film in a way represents my life. My grandparents suffered while shifting from India and I have carried that pain somewhere inside.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Obsession-with-marriage/article16299076.ece

  | Photo Credit: 07dfr antaheen The unsung hill State of Nagaland with its recently concluded Indian Panorama Film Festival is all set to become the precursor of things to come. Emboldened with the success of the first ever film festival in Nagaland, the Directorate of Film Festivals is ready to take the concept to other remote States, including those not traditionally known for either their film industry or hosting such fetes. States like Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, not quite known for their cinema, are likely to host similar events later this year.Speaking to The Hindu at the conclusion of the Nagaland fest, S.M. Khan, director, DFF, said, “We want to take the Indian Panorama Film Festival and also National Award-winning films to all parts of the country. We want people who do not have access to quality cinema to have a firsthand experience of acclaimed films in different Indian languages. For the first time we are also going to screen National Award-winning films in various State capitals. Earlier such films could be seen only in Delhi.”
Local content
After Kohima, the next festival is coming up in Shimla from May 28. Like the North East venture, it too shall have around 15 offerings with a mix of feature and non-features films. “In Shimla, we also plan to screen a Punjabi film, if possible. In fact, wherever we host the festival, we will make sure that local sentiment is respected and at least some of the films are in either the local language or they have content that local people can identify with,” Khan said.Unlike Kohima where stars were conspicuous by their absence, Shimla will keep its date with them during the three-day fest. Rahul Bose, Divya Dutta, Abhishek Pathak and Sivan are likely to attend. Among the films to be screened are “Haat: The Weekly Bazaar”, “Harishchandrachi Factory”, “Boond”, “Keshu” and “Antaheen” — the last one having already been shown in Kohima.After Shimla, the film caravan shall roll into Bhopal in July this year. Meanwhile, plans are afoot to take the festival down South, beginning with a three-day venture in Kerala's capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The summer of many challenges and cine feast continues with another possible edition in either Hyderabad or Chennai.“This is probably for the first time in its history that DFF is hosting film festivals across the country. We don't want that the cinema viewing experience should be available to only a handful in metropolises. We want to make it a universal phenomenon. That is why even beyond the Panorama festivals, we are all geared up to have retrospectives of Kamal Haasan and Ang Lee in July this year.” Incidentally, Kamal Haasan was scheduled to have a retrospective in Goa last year. It could not be held during IFFI as it was felt he deserved more than concurrent shows with other luminaries.All the Panorama festivals will conclude well before the International Film Festival of India kisses the coastal State of Goa in November this year.The show goes on.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/The-show-moves-on%E2%80%A6/article16298761.ece
741,Hero of the common man,Saraswathy Nagarajan,2010-05-06,16:30:17 IST,"Film Director Sathyan Anthikkad. Photo: C. Ratheesh Kumar
  | Photo Credit: C.RATHEESH KUMAR Sathyan Anthikkad continues the saga of the common man with his film ‘Katha Thudarunu,' which reaches theatres today. Scripted and directed by Sathyan, the film narrates the story of a single mother (Vidyalakshmi) who refuses to let circumstances crush her spirit or her sense of adventure. Common sense and sense of humour – the hallmark of every Sathyan film – is evident in this film as well. For the veteran director believes that if one is endowed with the two, one cannot be down in the dumps for too long. And who should know the secret of success better than this director who is celebrating his golden jubilee as a filmmaker with his ‘Katha Thudarunnu.'
Gift for comedy
Right from his first directorial venture, ‘Kurukkante Kalyanam,' Sathyan's heroes and heroines are people next door. Unerringly, he tapped the gift for comedy in actors such as Sukumaran, Nedumudi Venu, Mammotty and Mohanlal to eulogise the common man and his world of joys and sorrows. Over the years, he has gifted viewers with some of the most memorable heroes and heroines in Malayalam cinema.“All of them are my favourites,” says Sathyan with a smile. “But,” he adds, “among them it is undoubtedly Balagopalan of ‘T. P. Balagopalan MA' and Kochu Tressia of ‘Manasinakkare.' Balagopalan is very dear to me. All my other characters, I feel, are his cousins and friends. Preman (played by Jayaram), my hero in ‘Katha Thudurunnu,' could be his younger brother,” says Sathyan.Looking back at his eventful filmography, Sathyan says what he treasures during his stint in Mollywood are certain priceless moments that came his way on account of his work in cinema. “I cherish the fact that I was able to work with such a fine actor as Mohanlal. There were moments during the filming when he blurred the line between reel and real life. One moment, he could be laughing and joking but the moment he stands before the camera, within seconds, he becomes the character,” says Sathyan.A trifle sentimentally, he says he treasures the fact that he could hear, work and see playback singer K.J. Yesudas sing. “That is not something filmmakers of tomorrow would be able to say,” says Sathyan, also an evocative lyricist whose songs have been sung by Yesudas.Another golden moment he holds close to his heart happened while they were recording the songs of ‘Rasanthantram.' “Much before I entered tinsel town, Ilayaraja was someone I idolised a great deal. The fact that I am able to work with him is something precious to me. While the recording for ‘Rasathantram' was going on, Kamal Hassan's ‘Vettaiyadu Vilayadu' was being shot in the vicinity. During a break in the shoot Kamal would join Ilayaraja in the room that he used for composing. I told Kamal that my heroine's name was Kanmani in the film as I was inspired by his song ‘Kanmani Anbodu Kadhalan' in ‘Guna.' Immediately, Kamal hummed the lines of the Ilayaraja song sung by Kamal himself in the film. Ilayaraja played it on the harmonium and Kamal sang along. I value such moments more than awards and hits,” says Sathyan.Not that he is a stranger to hits and awards. Many of his films (especially the ones written by Sreenivasan and Lohitadas) have become classics in Malayalam cinema, while the much quoted dialogues have become film lore and a part of the vocabulary of Malayalis. He remembers with a smile how during the discussions for ‘Sandesham,' Sreenivasan had assured him: ‘I don't know if the film will be a hit or not. But it will certainly have the best of dialogues.'“Kerala was going through a period of political vacuum and that is when we began discussions on the film. Both Sreenivasan and I knew we had a good subject but we were unsure how it would work out on the screen. Finally it was Lohitadas who gave us the confidence to go ahead.” But when both Lohitadas and Sreenivasan became engrossed in their own works, Sathyan began writing his own scripts. “Fortunately, writing has never been a new domain for me. But I still discuss my scripts with Sreenivasan and other friends. For instance, in ‘Katha….' there is a twist to the story that was advised by Sreenivasan. Similarly, it was Lohitadas who advised me to make Narain's character a bank manager in ‘Bhagyadevta,'” says Sathyan.However, he avers that it is essential for a filmmaker to have his ear to the ground to catch the rumblings of change that shapes a society in transition. The veteran feels that many of today's films seem to have lost that lifeline to reality, which is one of the most important reasons for the problems plaguing Malayalam cinema. “I make one film and watch films for the rest of the year to understand what is happening around us. I must be one of the few people who must have watched the most number of Malayalam films that were released last year,” says Sathyan, who continues to live in the village (Anthikkad) that he has put on the map of cinema.Perhaps that is how Sathyan gives us those perfect snapshots of life in the suburbs, complete with three-dimensional characters who live their roles on the screen. “I am one of them,” says Sathyan. “I make a film when I have something to say.”With ‘Katha Thudarunnu' the raconteur unveils another facet of life in Kerala.

  | Photo Credit: special arrangement A modest but elegant house near Muttom in Thodupuzha, with waterfront views and greenery all around, makes for a rich frame for director Shaji Aziz's ‘Oridathoru Postman.' The film stars Kunchacko Boban, Innocent, Sarath Kumar, Kalabhavan Mani and Meera Nandan in the lead roles.“It's a serious A genuine story filled with humour, romance and sentiments,” says Shaji Aziz, who has earlier directed ‘Shakespeare MA (Malayalam)' with Shyju Anthikkad.“The story centres around the escapades of a father and son who live in this house. The father, Gangadharan (Innocent), is a postman in the village but not a very punctual one at that. He often fails to deliver letters and money orders on time and that is a cause of concern for all.“His long-suffering son, Reghunandanan (Kunchacko Boban), on the other hand, is a hardworking youth who teaches at a Public Service Commission examination coaching centre. He hopes to make it big but most of the money he earns from his salary, real estate and other businesses is barely enough to settle his father's bungles,” says the director.
Twist to the tale
“Reghunandanan often helps his father to deliver letters and comes across some letters that were left behind. He finds that the letters were addressed to one Yasin Mubarak and he decides to find him. The story takes a different turn once Raghunandanan sets off to find the addressee,” adds K. Gireesh Kumar, who has written the screenplay and dialogues of the film.Tamil actor Sarath Kumar, who has found great acceptance in Malayalam after his fine portrayal of Edachena Kunkan in the epic ‘Pazhassi Raja,' plays Yasin, a wildlife photographer. “Yasin is also an environmentalist. In fact, the sequences, which were shot earlier, had him requesting the villagers to keep their surroundings free from plastic waste, tobacco and so on. Presently we are shooting the scene where Yasin comes to meet Gangadharan,” says Sarath Kumar, while getting ready to face the camera.Meera Nandan plays Usha, a student at the coaching centre, who is in love with Reghunandanan, while Suraj Venjarammood, Salim Kumar and Jaffer Idukki, play “characters we would hope to come across in our villages” according to Gireesh Kumar.
Playing a cop
Kalabhavan Mani plays a cop, who despite talking and behaving in a comic way, is brilliant at his job and has a great track record.“The character is quite interesting and he presents himself initially in a comical way. I have really missed doing comedy for I love such roles. These days, though, I haven't had much opportunity to do such roles,” says Kalabhavan Mani.‘Oridathoru Postman' is being produced under the banner of Nila Creations. The cinematographer is Anand Balakrishnan. Lyrics by Kaithapram and Anil Panachooran have been composed by Mohan Sithara. The still photographer is Sinat Savier.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Addressing-love/article16298742.ece
743,My first break: Pyarelal,Rana Siddiqui Zaman,2010-05-06,15:58:10 IST,"Music Director Pyarelal
  
How it happened
Being from a musically driven family, I started arranging music at the age of 16. By 17, I became a composer. My father Pandit Ram Prasad Sharma, a trumpeter, taught me music and made me learn violin at the age of 12 from a Goan violinist. A famous director those days, who also gave a break to Kalyanji-Anandji was known to us. Once, I hesitatingly said to him, “You gave a chance to Kalyanji, give me one too.”He smiled and the next thing I knew was that I was to play the violin in the famous film “Haqeeqat” for which Madan Mohan composed music.The song was “Mein Ye Soch Uske Ghar Se Utha Tha.” He was so pleased with my performance that he came running and hugged me after the recording.
How it felt
At 17, it was thrilling and served as a great morale booster. In no time, he offered me “Parasmani”. That was in 1963. I couldn't believe my luck. Babubhai Mistry was a name to reckon with. No one would question his integrity. I and Laxmikant started working on the film. The film didn't do well but the music was a hit. It brought us close to known music directors like Naushad and Ravi and film producers like Tarachand Barjatya.
How life changed
The music of “Parasmani”, especially the song “Roshan Tumhi Se Duniya”, paved the way for us. The very next year director Satyen Bose gave us “Dosti”. It was Tarachandji's Rajshri Productions film. The film had new and young actors but its music was super hit. It got us our first FIlmfare Award in 1964. The most thrilling experience was that with “Dosti”, films like “Sangam” (music by Shankar-Jaikishan) and “Woh Kaun Thi” (Madan Mohan) were also nominated for the Filmfare Award.The award may have brought us fame, but unfortunately, it also created jealousy among our peers. Some of them canvassed against us and we stopped getting films. But we still got films from those who believed in us. Again from 1977 to 1980, we got the Filmfare Award consecutively for four years for “Amar Akbar Anthony” (1977), “Satyam Shivam Sundaram” (1978), “Sargam” (1979) and “Karz” (1980). In Ameen Sayani's “Binaca Geet Mala” our songs were regularly played among the top hits. Lata Mangeshkar made a great contribution to our success. She used to record 10 songs a month for other music directors, but for us she even sang 16 songs a month. Till date, I go to seek her advice in any music-related matter.Today, I miss Laxmikant, (he passed away in 1988) but I didn't stop making music. I have won friends like Jitendra, Dharmendra , Shashi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan in the film industry. Though I feel music has become quite technology-driven today, I always tell my students never to stop the use of acoustic instruments like flute, violin and sitar, for they are the basic ones. Today, there is even less poetry in songs. Dard-e-dil has become dard-e-disco. I and Laxmi did one good thing: We didn't take all films that came our way. We picked and chose even at the cost of sitting at home, unlike Shankar-Jaikishan. I still have lots of symphonies for kids that I wrote long ago, apart from western symphonies. I have few films today but I am happy that I haven't compromised with my kind of music.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/My-first-break-Pyarelal/article16298771.ece
744,Trying out a new turf,MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:25:34 IST,"A PRUDENT MAKE-OVER: Vikranth
  Whether Vikranth wishes it or not comparisons with his famous cousin have been inevitable. “It isn’t fair. Vijay Anna is innumerable notches higher. I’m just a beginner,” says Vikranth. Four films in four years and a solo hero in three of them, yet Vikranth has decided to toe the anti line in ‘Goripalayam,’ releasing today.“I’ve realized that to make up leeway I’ve got to be part of winning projects. And doing a negative role is a sure way of avoiding comparisons with my brother, because he’s never played villain,” he smiles.The young man has no problem admitting that he approached director Rasu Madhuravan for a chance to work with him. “I liked his ‘Maayaandi Kudumbathaar’ and called him up for an appointment. ‘I’ll get in touch with you myself,’ he said, and I thought it was another of those usual responses directors come up with.”But true to his word, Madhuravan contacted Vikranth and gave him ‘Goripalayam.’ “‘The film has 15 important characters and though yours has a negative slant, the scope it offers will be worthwhile,’ he told me. I make a late entry in the film but my character will make an impact,” he states with confidence. Those who have watched the film already have told him, “For the first time you don’t remind us of Vijay.” And wife Manasa who has been pulling his leg about his earlier roles, said, “You look nice in ‘Goripalayam.’” Vikranth and Manasa have known each other for long, and got married quite recently.Madhuravan has been so impressed with Vikranth’s show in ‘Goripalayam’ that he has booked him for his first production, ‘Vavvaal,’ to be directed by Bharatiraaja’s associate, So.Arulraj. Vikranth will also be working in Madhuravan’s next directorial venture.Criticisms about his earlier performances have singed the young actor. “I’ve been pained by comments,” he says. A debut film could make or irrevocably mar a hero’s career. ‘Karka Kasadara,’ his maiden attempt with Lakshmi Rai, wasn’t quite a judicious choice. “When I watched myself on screen I knew I had to start from scratch,” he concedes.Then came ‘Ninaithu Ninaithu Parthaen,’ again a non-starter. “But it had talented names Manikandan, Madhu Ambat, Joshua Sridhar …” defends Vikranth. Neither did ‘Nenjathai Killadhae’ in which he had ‘Ammuvaagiya Naan’ Bharathi as his pair work. “Directed by Agathiyan of ‘Kaadhal Kottai’ it is a film which I had pinned my hopes on,” he says.What did brother Vijay have to say about his performances? “He watched ‘Karka Kasadara’ and complimented me for my dances and stunts. ‘Work hard, talk little, turn a deaf ear to sycophancy and you’ll secure a safe niche in five years time,’ he advised. We meet often and discuss a lot of subjects but somehow, films haven’t been one of them.”Making it as a cricketer was Vikranth’s aim when in school and college. “In school Dinesh Karthik was my classmate and Badani my senior. Cricket, not acting, was the reigning passion then,” he says. Even today actors Arya, Jeeva, Ramesh, Ramana and Vikranth play regularly and participate in tournaments. The college team didn’t welcome the aspiring cricketer with open arms. Put off by the treatment meted out to him Vikranth gave up the game and began to concentrate on cinema.Like Vijay, Vikranth too began as a child actor. And again like Vijay who initially did ‘Senthoorapaandi’ with Vijayakanth to bolster up his career, Vikranth worked with the captain (Vijayakanth) in ‘Engal Aasan.’Getting back to ‘Goripalayam’ Vikranth says, Michael Rayappan, who is producing the film after the successful ‘Nadodigal,’ is immensely happy with the output. “He told Madhuravan, ‘You’ve done your job well. So my responsibility of taking it to the audience becomes greater now.’ For his part, Vikranth is keeping his fingers crossed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Trying-out-a-new-turf/article16298713.ece
745,Messiah off the mark,MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:23:14 IST,"ON USUAL LINES: Sura
  Adamantly adhering to the formula of a do-gooder’s one-man expedition against corruption, Vijay shows that he doesn’t intend to swerve even slightly from the path which he has trod on, in film after film. With ‘Sura’ (U) the capable crowd-puller follows the commercial pattern for the nth time in his career.Sura (Vijay) is the uncrowned prince of the fishermen’s colony, Yaazh Nagar. He offers succour to the people in his area and is looked upon as their saviour. Life goes on smoothly, till, of course, a Minister (Dev Gill) becomes too avaricious and all of a sudden wants to acquire the land on which the fishermen live.Vijay looks smarter than he did in his other recent films, his charming smile is intact, his poker-faced comedy has you in splits most of the time and his danger-courting stunts highlight his agility. Only when he overdoes things a little (like in the scene in court) does his performance lose appeal. So, if despite Vijay ‘Sura’ fails to sustain your interest it is the predictable story and the sagging screenplay that are to be blamed.Writer-director S.P. Raajakumar scores with his witty dialogue, though the fishermen’s gibberish about the greatness of the hero makes you want to scream. With MGR’s ‘Padagotti’ as the base Raajakumar has tried weaving a ‘modern’ yarn in a fishing settlement.A wealthy heroine falling for a poor fisherman is so outdated a premise that you don’t even find it funny anymore. The incongruity in the love affair between Sura (Vijay) and Purnima (Tamannaah) irritates.Vadivelu’s role of Umbrella is enjoyable whenever it melds with the main narration. Otherwise the track is just a time-wasting exercise.And what a let-down Tamannaah is, especially after her appealing chirpiness and pleasing screen presence in ‘Kandaen Kaadhalai’ and ‘Paiyya!’Ekambaram, the ace cameraman, who exquisitely captured the high seas that formed the backdrop of the story of ‘Iyarkkai,’ is in his elements once again in ‘Sura.’Zest marks Mani Sharma’s peppy numbers, and the pallavi of the opening song, ‘Vetri Kodi’ that portrays Vijay as a Messiah, is striking.A patient viewer can put up with a second love song, even when it hampers the flow of events. But by the time the lovers take off on their third duet he is down and out!Shooting an action sequence in the midst of a fleet of cars is fine, but why were two earth movers going this way and that like dinosaurs, in the background? Only the art director can explain the purpose!That it is his 50th film hasn’t come in his way of opting for the beaten track – so what if it is the half century mark and a milestone for an achiever, Vijay seems to ask.Predictable lines may have worked for one or two yesteryear heroes till the very end, but with changing tastes it is time Vijay begins to chalk out a different course. It isn’t dearth of talent, only an erroneous choice of roles. Come on Vijay, you can do it!",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Messiah-off-the-mark/article16298847.ece
746,"‘Raavanan’, a re-incarnation",MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:18:08 IST,"""In Hindi my presence has been kept under wraps as of now. I'm the proverbial dark horse, "" says Vikram about his role in the film 'Raavan'.
  | Photo Credit: g mail R
aavanan is almost ready and for Vikram it's another dream come true. “You know, I used to think one film each with Mani Ratnam and Shankar and I wouldn't mind retiring in that blaze of glory,” smiles Vikram. Always a picture of effervescence, mention Ratnam and his Raavanan (
Raavan in Hindi), and Vikram's energy level revs up further! He plays solid roles in both the Hindi and Tamil versions of the film — Raavanan is being dubbed in Telugu too. “Audiences in Andhra are bound to be floored by the subject,” Vikram's words ooze confidence.Interestingly, he isn't replicating the Tamil role in Hindi. “Here I'm Veera and in Hindi, Dev,” he smiles and on a serious note adds, “I hear that it's the first time in the world that an actor simultaneously plays two diametrically different roles in two languages of the same film.”
First straight Hindi film

Raavan isn't just Vikram's first project with Ratnam. It is also his first straight Hindi film. That he is being launched by the same reputed maker whom he yearned to work with sometime ago is a bonus! “You said it. Though Aparajith (
Anniyan dubbed in Hindi) didn't do too well, it's been telecast over 17 times so far. Yet Raavan is my first Hindi film,” he explains.Ratnam popped the question to Vikram just when they were about to begin shooting for Raavanan. “I think you can pull it off. Why not give it a shot?” he suggested. “Are you sure,” was Vikram's pithy response. Being in the habit of working on his physique and make-up to suit every part he portrays Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously. But locations were very remote and sets may not last for more than a month, he was told.So what did he do? “I've played little tricks with my body language and expressions and they should work,” he smiles cryptically. “I'm like a bull in one version — tough, rugged and a man who lives for the moment. In the other, my character is poetic, philosophical, fun loving… just about everything.”After the Hindi audio launch in Mumbai, the attention he got from the girls in particular was surprising. “I mean, after all these years…” he laughs gaily.Has he tried out a new look for Hindi? “Surely not the clean shaven look. I don't intend to look like other heroes. I've plumped for a close hair-cut and moustache. In Hindi my presence has been kept under wraps as of now. I'm the proverbial dark horse,” he chortles.Not many know that Vikram had earlier screen-tested for Mani Ratnam's Bombay. “But the wait has been worth it. Over the years, I've evolved as an actor. I feel in Raavan Mani has transcended his earlier achievements. The films should hit the bull's eye.”Working with Ratnam has been an engaging experience for Vikram. “He's open to your inputs. Raavanan And his energy is unbelievable. After a day's work, we would rehearse the scenes to be shot the next morning, costumes et al, before we dispersed. He would mull over them all night and be ready with the changes he wants.” ”Vikram can't stop talking about the films' locations. “We've shot entirely in India and you can't but say ‘Wow! We didn't know such beautiful places exist here.' We've gone to the unexplored plateaus of the Malshej Ghats, beyond Pune, and to the mist-covered Orccha near Jhansi where we saw clouds just sitting down on the roads through which we walked. Sameer Chanda's sets have blended so well with the milieu that you can't differentiate between the natural landscapes and those created.”They've also shot in the remote areas of Kolkata and the rarely-visited terrains on the other side of Chalakudi. “Manikandan and Santhosh Sivan have captured them so beautifully on camera,” comments Vikram.
Big ride to scenic spots
The unit was put up in an ashram of sorts on the hills, from where everyday they travelled for about an hour by car, then geared up for a 30-minute jeep ride after which they trekked another 15 minutes to reach the scenic spots!“AB (Abhishek Bachchan) and I have given our interpretations of the roles. But Raavan is more an AB film,” says Vikram. And about working with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, he simply says, “It was nice.”Now that his aspirations have been realised, what more could he want? “I've recorded a song for G.V. Prakash for Madrasapattinam along with MSV. And I'm waiting for a chance to sing for A.R. Rahman. I love his Raavanan compositions, especially ‘Veera' and ‘Usirae Pogudhae.' Also I want to turn director one day… so there's a lot more left to be done,” he guffaws.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/lsquoRaavananrsquo-a-re-incarnation/article16299040.ece
747,This joke's on you,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:57:33 IST,"The Sajids (producer Nadiadwala and director Khan) virtually declared war on film critics by setting a historic precedent. They not just refused to have a press screening for reviewers but also went on record giving reasons for their decision — nature of the film's genre, effect of premature criticism on its business, advent of Twitter fuelling word-of-mouth bad reviews, etc.Once you watch Housefull, you realise that's what any smart filmmaker would do. No sarcasm there. Seriously, Housefull is an inspired escapist, borderline plagiarised, no-holds-barred, silly slapstick comedy that does not even pretend to have a plot, let alone logic or plausibility.Many of the jokes are forced in, the filmmaker trying to milk the ridiculousness of situational comedy for as many laughs as possible per minute even if it means letting characters slap each other for no reason at all.While critics revel in taking on films like these and more so, given the public display of arrogance, reviewers seem to have ridiculed the film for all the wrong reasons. Housefull has got plenty of flak for being a crude, sexist, offensive comedy. Like that's a bad thing.Though comedies such as American Pie, Dumb and Dumber, Road Trip and The Hangover have been celebrated as cult classics, the genre still remains in the domain of low-brow entertainment and filmmakers attempting it here are the favourite whipping boys of critics. Most of it has to do with plagiarised plots, situations and even lines, though the makers in some cases have gone ahead and acquired the rights to remake the film (while continuing to take credit for Story, Screenplay and Dialogues).
Housefull is a classic case study of factors plaguing comedy in India, despite the emergence of Judd Apatow's unapologetically offensive films as a legitimate sub-genre.So if these overtly sexist films are accepted and embraced by men and even women of late at an International level, why can't we laugh when Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh decide to do a Ben Stiller gag?Here's why. Originality factors apart, these adaptations are just not funny enough. While Housefull provides a considerable number of laughs in the second half, there are also a considerable number of jokes that fall flat all through the film.Within the film's first few minutes, we learn that Akshay Kumar plays a loser who brings bad luck to all around him and hence, is employed by a Casino that wants to make sure all their clients lose their money. If you are wondering how the Casino remains unaffected by his bad luck, you ought to get out of that movie hall when you still can. This is not your kind of film.The loser then decides to stay at his best buddy's place in London only to get married to the wrong girl (who does a Heartbreak Kid on him during their honeymoon in Italy) and falls in love with another girl (while Forgetting his Sarah Marshall) and in the second half of the film, needs to Meet The Parents… Or the Brother in this case, who is the same suspicious brother borrowed from Right Bed, Wrong Husband (last adapted in Ajay Devgn's All The Best). The makers also find time to recycle gay jokes from Kal Ho Na Ho and Dostana.Yes, the guys are cool and the women are totally hot when they are prancing around in bikinis. But with barely an original bone in its skeletal story outline, Housefull at best works in bits and starts as a series of inspired gags — many forced and a few spontaneous. Hate it as much as you want but you will find it impossible to stifle a laugh.Watch it only if you are forgiving and don't mind junk food for the thoughtless.

748,Reason to cheer,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:55:43 IST,"Trust good old Clint Eastwood to craft a film that transcends the spirit of sport with its political layering without compromising on the integrity of a riveting sports film or the reputation of a celebrated leader of a nation while focussing on one of the lesser-known aspects of his personality.Mandela's interest in the game was not just a political move but a “human calculation,” as the newly elected President (Morgan Freeman lends a lot of grace and dignity to Mandela) insists, quite early on.The docudrama begins with Mandela's first day on the job as the new President. “He can win an election but can he run a country,” asks the front page of a daily as he goes for his early morning walk, with just two security guards for company.Eastwood loses no time at all to introduce us to the security risks, and the sub-plot with his security aides keeps the drama alive (the moment with the plane over the stadium is a heart-stopper) when the sport portions of the film are yet to take off.Though based on the book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation, the filmmaker takes some cinematic licence to replace Mandela's source of inspiration. Apparently, Mandela in reality had given the rugby captain Pienaar an extract from Theodore Roosevelt's speech that inspired him and not the poem Invictus written by William Ernest Henley.
Invictus is the story of a President who decides to channel the country's passion for sport as a unifying force to blur racial differences by deciding to back the dominantly white Springboks team when the rest of the Sports Ministry is baying for the blood of the players and stepping up the pressure to change the name of the team.But it's also the story of the other leader, the rugby captain Pienaar (Matt Damon's on a roll — The Green Zone and now, Invictus) who has to motivate the team and back the lone-black player in the team and see the team through its rough patch and strive for the kind of glory they hadn't even imagined.Eastwood's genius lies in making us see how the challenges both these leaders face were not too different and the solutions weren't too different either.Between Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, the actors have oodles of charisma to charm the audience and they turn in a sincere, natural portrayal, backed with some crisp writing (Anthony Peckham).It helps that Eastwood resists the urge to hero-worship the President and treats him like an ordinary dutiful old man, who despite his superhuman faith in humanity, is a vulnerable workaholic with a miserable domestic life.This sort of sensitivity and balance is what makes Eastwood the master filmmaker that he is and that's exactly what makes Invictus transcend the sport film genre and keeps us hooked till the very end despite the predictability of the format.A truly inspiring and uplifting sports film guaranteed to make you feel good.
Genre: Drama
Director: Clint Eastwood
Cast: Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, Tony Kgoroge
Storyline: Two leaders, Nelson Mandela and Pienaar, the captain of his rugby team, need to inspire a country and the team by setting an example and leading from the front.

Once her prowess is established through two sequences, including one where screen scorcher Nasser is reduced to a pale shadow of himself, it's time to move on to 200 years later.Priya (Keethika), a precocious child, the daughter of Ramjhi and Sangeetha, gyrates to adult steps and draws like a dream, coming up with a visual of an ancient yellow car. Soon, she is possessed by the spirit of a girl called Savithri (a terribly out-of-sorts-and-shape Kaveri — whatever happened to the cute actor?).Cut to flashback mode, and the stories of Savithri, her brother, Karuppu (Ganja Karuppu) and their adored yellow car (washed only with warm water, mind you!). Savithri is cheated by her fiancé Nanjappan (Riyaz Khan), and given as sacrifice by his sorcerer friend Mandiramoorthy. Her brother also dies in the process of saving her. His spirit is locked in the yellow car, till Kenathadi Kali frees him to avenge his sister's death. Two of Nanjappan's friends are killed by the possessed child — one in the harbour and another in the circus ring — and, he's next in line. Enter a miniature villian (Mandiramoorthy's guru) mouthing “Jakkamma” ever so often, and the stage is set for a lopsided fight, not-so special effects and all.Finally, evil is vanquished, but not before you are forced to sit through some more songs where your heart bleeds for the child artiste, who seems to have little else to do other than look startled, angry and roll her eyes, all this in the midst of bad lip-sync.Ramjhi and Sangeetha have little to do except perform pujas, make thayir saadham, and cry about their daughter's fate. And, Delhi Ganesh plays the grandfather who loves ftv. Ouch!There's little to say in terms of story or production value. Strange, considering director Rama. Narayanan is a veteran in children's and godly movies, even if they are terribly over-the-top! As for the music, Deva's brief seems to have been to come up with such high-decibel dabbankuthu that even the Transformers-look-alike dances. He succeeds.Now, the only question is how this can be called a fun film for the kids to go to this summer! There's gore, the sacrifice scene leaves you retching and the dialogues are written with least sensitivity.

The big move
Director Vijaya Varman's Biriyani, an emotional drama of the plight of a young domestic help, has won teenage actor Poo Myli, the ‘Best Actress' award at the Short Film Festival of Los Angeles. The film, based on Subhalakshmi Narayanan's short story, and with music by Mohan Narayanan, has been Varman's stepping stone into films. He now directs a full-length Tamil film, Ninaivodu Vilayadu, starring Master Mahendran and Nandana. The music is by Swar Mogi, while Varman has written the story, screenplay and dialogues.”
Recreating a hit
Twenty-seven years ago, Thyagarajan acted with Sarita, Silk Smita and Jayamalini in the huge hit Malayoor Mambattiyan, which was remade in Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Now, he has cast his son Prashanth in the new version of the film, titled Mambattiyan, with Meera Jasmine and Mumaith Khan for company.Will the new film re-create the magic of the original? With Prakash Raj and Vadivelu in key roles, the theme should work with present-day audiences, we think.
Getting real
Tiruvannamalai's 10-day Brahmotsavam, where more than 15 lakh devotees throng the town, forms a major part of the A.G. Raja-produced , Ivar. Directed by N. Priyan, the film was initially meant to be Raja's directorial venture. “Since I was introducing four new actors as the main leads, I felt that someone as talented as Priyan should also be given a chance to prove his talent. And, he has done a wonderful job,” says Raja.The film revolves around four youngsters who are interested only in the present. Since the film focusses on the men, the songs feature male voices too. Also, there are no choreographed dances or ‘contrived' fight sequences, says the producer. “There's a dance, but an impromptu one that happens in a TASMAC bar,” he adds.
Novel attempt
Director Keera's Pacchai Engira Kaathu is the story of 27-year-old Pacchai Ramkumar, narrated from the point of view of seven individuals. Based on a real-life incident, Keera's movie is about the life of youth who blindly support politicians and parties. Newcomer Vasagar plays the hero, while another new face Devathai plays his love interest. Says Keera: “The story is narrated in flashback mode by four persons at the time of the hero's unlikely death. As the film progresses, two more persons join the narration, including the heroine's sister. Finally, I, the director, complete the story.”

he svelte Shilpa Shetty judged the first season of ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa', the second season of ‘Bigg Boss' on Colors and will now be judging the second season of the war-of-the-genders dance competition, ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' on Star Plus. The actor on judging celebrities and why television works for her.
You have only two films — “The Man” and “Desire” lined up. Are you gradually bidding goodbye to films?
Sunny Deol's “The Man” has been stalled. I shot for “Desire” six months ago, but there is still some work left. I really wanted to take a break… I have been working continuously for the last 18 years. I have so much happening that I just do not have the time.
Meanwhile, it seems you have taken a liking to television — after ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa' and ‘Bigg Boss', it is ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha now.
Television works well for me because it does not take too much of my time, the audience sees me and I enjoy the chance to say my bit in front of people. So I always try to do something different on TV every year. ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance show and is obviously different from ‘Bigg Boss' in which I was a host. And though I have been a judge before, this is a new format.
But there doesn't seem to be any significant difference in the show's format — it will be the same girls versus boys competition.
The difference would be us — the new set of judges. The show is being aired on Star Plus and so more money has been spent on the production, packaging, costumes this time around.
Being a dancer yourself, do you get impatient or irritated when untrained celebrities perform badly on a platform such as likethis?
‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance-oriented show and I know a bit of dance, so my job is a little easy. All the participating celebrities are good dancers — we have sifted out the bad ones.
Does the at fact that you will be judging ‘TV celebrities' make it difficult for you to criticise them?
All the participants know that they will be judged; and that we are here to judge them. We are not here to pinpoint who is a bad dancer and who is better. We are here to see who performs better on a particular day.
Will the jury be biased towards the girls because it consists of two women — Vaibhavi Merchant and you — while Arshad Warsi is the only mansole male?
As judges, we have to forget the gender we belong to and have an unbiased opinion. I will try my best to do that.
Is there any particular dance form which you are still not confident about?
I'm not very good with locking and popping. I'm so glad it has come in recently; and not in my time (
laughs). I don't think my body is meant for that kind of dance form; my arms are very long. I just love the way these new kids do this dance. I'm amazed by the talent we have in our country. I'm a Bharatnatyam dancer but for “Desire” I had to learn Odissi and it was difficult, inspite of being a dancer.
Who are your favourite dancers from the industry?
I think Rishi Kapoor was a phenomenal dancer. He never missed a single beat. See his songs. I'm sure the choreographer never ever told him to do the step a particular way. He was superb … what synchronisation!
We saw husband Raj Kundra by your side throughout the IPL. Any chances of him making an appearance on this show?
Star Plus cannot afford him. They still do not have that kind of money.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Reality-bytes/article16298702.ece

  The master story teller is back to making a socio-romantic musical entertainer after a gap of five years. Veteran filmmaker K. Raghavendra Rao is making his 105th celluloid statement, Jhummandhinaadham with a theme that largely harps on our rich traditional music and heritage, according to producer Lakshmi Prasanna. Starring her brother Manoj Kumar Manchu and debutante Tapsi in the lead with her father Mohan Babu playing a pivotal character.At the Ramoji Film City, the atmosphere is one of celebration. A celebration showcasing unity and patriotism, capsuled into a song written by Chandra Bose and composed by Maragatha Mani Keeravani. Raghavendra Rao usually does the preliminary designing of the song sequence, making the job of the choreographer easy.Choreographer Suchitra Chandra Bose in consultation with the master craftsman is guiding the actors to perform that includes apart from the lead pair and Mohan Babu, Suman, Brahmanandam, M.S. Narayana, Pragathi, Aishwarya and others.
Desamante Matham kadhu… the song is played on the nagara and lensman S. Gopala Reddy captures the emotions of the actors. Desamante Manushuloy the song continues as the next block is taken for filming. It reminds you of the song, Punyabhoomi Naa Desam Namo Namaami from Major Chandrakanth in which the legendary N.T. Rama Rao played the title role. Keeravani is at his best one more time, you agree as you listen to the song.“It is a musical story with nine songs,” informs Lakshmi Prasanna. “A lot of research has gone into the making of these songs and the story. We are forgetting our traditional songs. How many of us know today that once during marriage ceremonies, songs recalling the family tree and roots of the bride/bridegroom are sung as the marriage parties reach each other's house. It is like nostalgia to the older generation and introduction of our rich traditional heritage to the young audience.”A wide variety of musical bonanza- from folk, lullaby, devotional, patriotic to fusion music awaits the discerning cine goers. “There is a competition song filmed on dad (Mohan Babu) and Manoj on the lines of the one that was shot on Nagesh and dad in Allari Mogudu,” says Lakshmi Prasanna.The camera now focuses on Manoj and Mohan Babu as they place their steps to Keeravani's tune. “This is the first time dad is playing a full length role in a Manoj film,” says the happy producer. “This movie presents Manoj in a different light, as a soft looking guy. In looks and acting it is a complete makeover from his earlier movies,” says the proud sister. Manoj has that certain ease in his acting be it in action, comedy or emoting.The conversation shifts to Tapsi, the newcomer to Telugu cinema. “ She plays a girl from the U.S. who is on a research work on Telugu traditions, music and culture. Manoj acts as her guide and the journey begins,” she smiles. The journey takes the audience on a roller coaster ride of entertainment laced with a gamut of emotions, wit, humour and a medley of music as the title indicates.“After this song, we have a four day talkie part to finish before flying to South Korea to film the remaining song on the lead pair,” signs off Lakshmi.

753,Bale Piaa!,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:30:05 IST,"Very few actors here come without strings attached. Especially, the watchful eye of mom or dad on the sets. Piaa Bajpai of Goa fame is one of those rare actors who does it all by herself.As her film Bale Pandiya, directed by Siddharth Chandrashekar, readies for release (the audio launch happened recently), Piaa talks about her journey that began here with the Khosla Ka Ghosla remake, Poi Solla Porom, and continues with the K.V. Anand film Ko, to be out in August.
How it started
But, her journey to showbiz started five years ago when the girl from Uttar Pradesh left home for Delhi after doing a diploma in computer science.“I wanted to prove to my parents that I could live by myself. Giving tuitions was good business in Delhi back then. You could make up to Rs. 1,500 a kid. So if you took tuition for seven to eight kids, you could make good money. I also worked as a receptionist.“After a year, I got tired of going to office, coming back and doing nothing else. For a year, I had not taken money from my parents. Then, they grew confident about me, and I shifted to Mumbai,” she recalls.
Dubbing for serials
Piaa started dubbing for TV serials. “Since I was from U.P., my Hindi was good. I could make Rs. 250 - Rs. 300 doing just one session. Then, I started getting offers only for dubbing. When you want to see yourself on screen, but are dubbing instead for someone else, it's very depressing. So, I decided to stop dubbing, and started doing print ads, then commercials and music videos.”The auditions led to a commercial directed by Priyadarshan. “I was very apprehensive about working in the South because I didn't know anyone here. But, when Priyadarshan Sir asks you if you want to audition for a Tamil film, how can you not do it? I lied to him that Tamil wouldn't be a problem,” she laughs.“They auditioned me in English and Hindi and the Tamil audition came much later.”Now that she has shot for a few Tamil films (
Poi Solla Porom, Aegan, Goa, Bale Pandiya and Ko), Piaa understands the language better. “I write my lines in English-Hindi and memorise them, and the director tells me how to emote.”“In Bale Pandiya, I play a happy girl living with her grandfather. She falls in love with a boy who thinks he's a loser. We shot for three to four months. It's a good role,” she says, narrating an anecdote about how she fought sea-sickness with cans of tamarind. “We were shooting on a yacht, and I wasn't used to the sea.”Shooting by the beaches and partying in Goa for Venkat Prabhu's Goa, and now sailing. What a difficult life for an actor!“It's not like that. You have to shoot when you are not well. Sometimes, in the hot sun… you have to sing, dance, smile, not be tense, or look tired. No matter what's going on in your mind, it should not show on your face. It gets tough for me sometimes, because, when I am upset, it shows on my face.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Bale-Piaa/article11639885.ece

When I finished my masters in Bio-technology, I got a chance to act in a film by popular director Logidas. Unfortunately, it did not materialise. So when Meera Kathiravan, his associate, asked me to act in his film, I didn't evince much interest. Moreover, it was not the role of the heroine. But the director succeeded in convincing me and the film was Aval Peyar Thamizharasi.It was exciting to see myself on the screen. I watched the film in a theatre in Tenkasi where I had been on a holiday. To my surprise, people recognised me and some even came forward to talk to me. They wished that I should appear on screen more often.After my debut, people recognise me wherever I go. Except that nothing much has changed. Acting is a passion for me. I would like to do more powerful roles and make a mark in the industry. I did not do any other film for nearly a year as I was waiting for a good break.

Akshay plays monkey!
With hi-definition technology being the order of the day, Housefull producer Nadiadwala Grandson has tied up with Hungama Digital Media and launched a digital promotion campaign for the multi-starrer. An online game application has been devised on the Akshay-monkey slapping episode from the film. The player can choose to be either the ape or Akshay and the objective of the game is to slap the other person harder.When we asked Akshay to make a choice, he jested, “I'd rather be a monkey as his reflexes are stronger.” When it was Deepika's turn to answer, she spontaneously replied, “I'd always be Akshay because I could never hit him.”
No Ranbir for now
There has been much talk in tinseltown about Ranbir-Deepika's on-off relationship, not just onscreen but off screen as well. Last seen together in Bachna Ae Haseeno, there was a buzz about Deepika signing her next film opposite the young Kapoor.When queried about it at an event, she curtly said, “When I sign, I'll let you know.”
Humour to the rescue
Sajid Khan, director of Housefull, is making a tall claim. He brags that Akshay's comic timing in his film will remind the audience of the peerless comedy king, Kishore Kumar, especially in his scenes with Riteish.The proof of the pudding lies in the eating. And Akshay amply provided the proof when he bailed Sajid out. Some time back, Manoj Kumar was miffed with Sajid and had said that flinging mud at others only makes the person who is flinging the mud, dirty. At the Housefull event, a contrived Sajid responded to Manoj's comment with, “Manoj Kumar is a veteran and I will never make fun of him. If he thinks I am mud, then so be it.”Akshay instantly quipped, “After all, a lotus can grow only in mud,” and made an otherwise sheepish Sajid grin from ear to ear.
Archana's role
Ask Badmaash Company director what his wife Archana Puran Singh's contribution to his film was and the hunky Punjabi actor-turned-director says: “When I took a break for this film, she became the husband as well as the wife. She took care of the finances which took most of the burden off my head. Finances are something that can kill a man; and this was why I couldn't become a director earlier. I was trying to fulfil my duties as breadwinner, husband and father. Finally, when I decided I needed to do something for myself and live my dream for once, she said ‘Go fulfil your dream'. I'm very fortunate I have a wife like her.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Mumbai-Express/article16298688.ece

K.L.V. Vasantha, T.K. Shanmugham, T.R. Mahalingam, T.S. Balaiah, N.S. Krishnan, T.A. Mathuram and Kumari Rukmini
K.L.V. Vasantha was one of the popular heroines of early Tamil cinema. Slim and attractive, she could also sing well. She made her debut in Sri Kanda Leela (1938), a Premier Cinetone, Coimbatore production, directed by noted filmmaker H.S. Mehta, and written by well-known writer L. Nanjappa Chettiar, one of the directors of the production company and studio.Vasantha hit big time in 1939 when she played the title role in Rambayin Kaathal, directed by noted filmmaker B.N. Rao. Critics remarked that the celestial beauty of Lord Indra's court, Rambha, would have looked like Vasantha!Following the success of Rambayin Kaathal, Vasantha was cast in Bhooloka Rambai. A folktale with many twists and turns, it's about a prince (Shanmugham) falling in love with Bhooloka Rambha (Vasantha), their secret marriage, getting a child to be sacrificed, and later saved by Divine Grace… His friend (Mahalingam) travels with him; they meet birds that talk and predict their future. Again directed by Rao, the film was produced by M. Somasundaram (Jupiter Somu) and M.D. Viswanathan under the banner of Salem Shanmugha Films and Vijaya Maruthi Pictures at Central Studios, Coimbatore. During the making of the film, the producers ran into financial problems and work halted for sometime. Around this time, the later day Indian movie mogul S.S. Vasan had just entered as a distributor with his Gemini Pictures Circuit (GPC) and was looking for movies for distribution. He called on Rao at Coimbatore and asked him whether he could complete the film in time for Deepavali if he funded the project. He also told him he was in the process of acquiring a studio in Madras, and promised Rao that he would be the director of his first production. Vasan who never went back on his word engaged Rao for the first Gemini Studios production Madanakamarajan (1941) which somewhat interestingly had much common ground in Bhooloka Rambai (both were written by well-known writer and playwright B.S. Ramaiah.)
Bhooloka Rambai proved a success and Vasantha's popularity grew by a few more notches. Besides being cast as the heroine in Madanakamarajan, Vasan cast her as ‘Chandralekha' in his mammoth movie. However, for many reasons, Vasantha opted out, and T. R. Rajakumari came on board to create movie history.In those days, Tamil films were screened all over South India without any dubbing or subtitles, and people watched them with interest. To give them an indication of the storyline, producers invariably had an English title for each of the Tamil film. For example, Gumasthavin Penn had the title, Clerk's Daughter!For the same reason, the name of this film in English was given in posters as Bhooloka Rambha and not ‘Rambai' as in Tamil. B.N. Rao told this writer years later that the name of the celestial dancer was Rambha and not Rambai!As usual, the N. S. Krishnan-T.A. Mathuram pair took care of the comedy and sang a couple of duets in their own inimitable style.
Remembered for: the interesting storyline, gripping on-screen narration, the impressive presence and performance of Vasantha, and the comedy of Krishnan-Mathuram.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Blast-from-the-past-Bhooloka-Rambai-1940/article16298691.ece

Taut screenplay and climactic surprises will be the crowd-pulling factor of the film and the film is set to create waves, he said.The film also marks the 10th project of the director and 25th film for Suriya. The director said the second half would stir considerable curiosity among the audience and has all the ingredients of a racy entertainer.Suriya dons the role of a police officer in the film, pairing up with Anoushka. Hari has a signature style of setting his films in lush countryside and this film will be no different. The story is based in Thoothukudi and nearby villages, with some portions shot around Chennai. Suriya has got a makeover and would sport a new look as a police officer, with a stylish moustache. “His film Kaakha Kaakha is still quite popular with Tamil audience. It was tricky for me to pull out Suriya off that image. I created this character as a personality that is a contrast to the role of ‘Anbuchelvan',” he told The Hindu recently.The film will have a lot of action sequences and a good amount of hilarity, with Vivek handling the comedy track. Hari promises that the movie will have logical sequences and everyday issues are narrated in cinematic language. The director does not brook comparisons with filmmakers scripting off-beat movies. “They are doing an excellent job and taking Tamil cinema to the next step. But the industry also needs some dose of commercial element. I have no intentions to attempt such different storylines.

761,Food inflation softens,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,13:05:45 IST,"The arrival of rabi (winter) crops has helped reduce prices of essential items as food inflation further eased.
  With prices of essential commodities cooling a tad on arrival of rabi crops, food inflation softened further to 16.04 per cent for the week ended April 24 from 16.61 per cent in the previous week.Even as the general expectation is that a normal monsoon, if as projected by the India Meteorological Department comes true, would help in easing food prices further, fuel inflation held steady at 12.69 per cent owing to higher prices following the hike in duties on petrol and diesel.Significantly, despite persistent demands by the Opposition earlier this week for rolling back the hike in fuel prices, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee held firm and expressed his inability to do so owing to the fragile fiscal situation.The gradual decline in food inflation for the second week in a row has raised hopes of some moderation in the overall inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for April from the March level of 9.9 per cent. The headline WPI inflation data for April is expected to be released next week.According to Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu, the headline inflation is likely to soften to 6-7 per cent in the coming months. “I expect the overall WPI to come down to 6-7 per cent in the next three months,” he said.However, despite the declining trend in recent weeks, food inflation has remained above 15 per cent since November last year. Keeping this mind, the United Nations' organisation ESCAP has expressed concern over the food price spiral even as it projected a cool-down during the year.During the week, inflation eased on account of lower prices of fish, wheat, fruits and vegetables which declined by one per cent each. However, the prices of tea went up by 13 per cent while gram, maize and eggs were also dearer by one per cent each.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Food-inflation-softens/article16298862.ece

  As board examinations slowly fade into memory and students prepare for their results, the season of obtaining application forms for various courses has begun.Most government and self-financing institutions have started issuing application forms for admission into professional as well as arts and science courses. But, with intense competition pushing students to have multiple backup options, application fee collected along with the forms seems to have become a revenue-generating option for colleges, say parents and students.G. Abdul Haseeb, a parent, says “Some professional colleges give 15-page application forms with pictures of the college library and canteen printed on glossy paper. As a result, they charge exorbitant amount as application fee.”He says that it especially affects students in the 60-to-75 percentile category who might want to keep options open and end up applying to many colleges. “Some kind of regulation is needed and a uniform application fee regime must be brought in.”K.Ramnath, awaiting his class XII results, says “My parents wanted me to apply to many courses. I have already spent more than Rs.2,000 on application forms. I will also be applying for law and a couple of bachelors programmes.”Students also say that if one applies for two or more courses in some colleges, a separate fee has to be paid each time. The application cost of popular courses such as B.Sc Visual Communication is twice that of a B.Com course in the same college.S.Narasimhan, principal, DG Vaishnav College, which is an aided institution, says that irrespective of the number of courses in a college, there must be only one application form. “Students can give their course preference in a single form. Government guidelines also clearly state that colleges must give out applications only after the Class XII results are announced. Students have to be given the chance to make an informed choice.” Higher Education Secretary, K. Ganesan, said that there was no reason for one college to have multiple forms. “Instructions will be issued to all colleges in this regard immediately.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/lsquoApplication-form-season-on/article16298633.ece
765,No words to explain the exceptional depravity: Judge,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,23:58:57 IST,"The “brutality” of offences committed by Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab, the “depravity” of his mind and his “voluntary” act of becoming a terrorist as per the prosecution's case formed the basis for awarding the death sentence to the lone surviving attacker of 26/11.The special sessions court in its reasoning for the sentence stated: “There is no evidence of mental or emotional disturbance. On the contrary, he [Kasab] appeared to be mentally prepared. The court has taken note that this man [Kasab] voluntarily went to the office of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. No leader took him there. He along with his friend Muzaffar went from place to place without being accompanied by anybody [from Lashkar]. He [Kasab] offered to become a mujahid. He was prepared to face all kinds of training. He refused the option of returning to his relatives' place and preferred to [remain at the training camp]. There is no chance of reformation or rehabilitation of such a person. The way he has committed the offence gives the court no scope for considering his reformation or rehabilitation.”The court rejected the defence argument of moral justification for Kasab's crimes as it found it to be “frivolous.” It also rejected defence lawyer K.P. Pawar's contention that his client was acting under duress and domination of the Lashkar bosses.“Where is the duress,” the court asked. “He and Muzaffar knocked on the door of the Lashkar office. He has shown no duress or domination. Instead, the delay in the attack [upset] him. He was anxious to attack India. He asked the wanted accused [of Lashkar] why there was a delay.”The criterion of young age was rejected by the court in the light of “the aggravating factors as argued by Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam on behalf of the State.”“The murders were committed after previous planning. Not only was there previous planning, but meticulous and systematic planning with all the modern equipment available. All possible precautions were taken to see to it that the attack was a success. The court has accepted Mr. Nikam's argument,” judge M.L. Tahaliyani said.In agreement with the prosecution's argument of unimaginable brutality, the court noted, “[The memory of] brutality was writ large on the faces of the witnesses. When you read the evidence of witnesses at CST [Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus], see the photographs of [photographer] Sebastian D'Souza, I don't think any words are required to describe the brutality. Some witnesses were not even ready to be police witnesses although having seen the incident, and some were not ready to come to court although their statement had been recorded by the police.”Commenting on the incident, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “There are no words to explain the exceptional depravity seen in the initial stages of commission of offence. When he fired indiscriminately, it was without any regard; children and women were killed.”The court also took into consideration that police officers and public servants were “assaulted, injured and killed” by Kasab and his associates.Having listed the observations, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “It is difficult for me to prepare a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The balance is totally in favour of the prosecution.”The court took into account the observations made by the Supreme Court in Bacchan Singh vs. State of Punjab, 1980. However, it noted that the nature of crimes committed by Kasab and the other attackers were not in the sight of the apex court. “The facts of this case are very different. The circumstances are so aggravating that it is impossible to mitigate any of the circumstances.”The judge also drew upon the principles of jurisprudence by jurist Salmond: “To enjoy an effective system of law we have to impose a penalty which [befits] the crime committed by the accused.” Referring to the case of Ankush Maruti vs. State of Maharashtra, he said, “Undue sympathy to give less penalty will do more harm to the justice system.” With reference to the case of Dhananjay Chatterjee alias Dhana vs. State of West Bengal, the court observed the rights of people at large need also to be considered along with the rights of the convict.Mr. Nikam expressed his happiness for the verdict before the media. “Today we have been successful in giving justice to the victims of 26/11 and the departed souls. I also feel relieved on being discharged from Arthur Road jail. We did not fall for the foul games Kasab was trying to play. I think the Crime Branch officers, they deserve all the praise.”Kasab's lawyer on the other hand said he was satisfied with the work he had done. “It was very difficult for me to defend; the evidence was voluminous. I did my job successfully and the court appreciated my efforts. The way I placed my case was the most important thing for me. I could find many good points. It's the court's jurisdiction whether to accept or reject the arguments. I am satisfied with my endeavours,” he said.The court sentenced Kasab to life imprisonment for offences committed under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 307 (attempt to murder), 307 read with 109 (abetment) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 364 (kidnapping or abducting), 121 A (conspiracy to wage war), 122 (collecting arms with the intention of waging war), and Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/No-words-to-explain-the-exceptional-depravity-Judge/article16298877.ece

767,Kasab sentenced to death,Rahi Gaikwad,2010-05-06,23:08:13 IST,"Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab “shall be hanged by neck till he is dead.”Pronouncing these words, the Special Sessions Court here on Thursday sentenced to death the lone surviving gunman of the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.Kasab was given the death penalty on five counts: murder, abetment to murder, waging war, criminal conspiracy and committing terrorist acts.He was also awarded life imprisonment on five counts: attempt to murder in furtherance of a common intention, kidnapping and abducting in order to murder, conspiracy to wage war, collecting arms with the intention of waging war and causing explosion thus endangering life and property.‘
Aapko char offences ke liye sazaye maut di jaati hai. [You have been sentenced to death for four offences],' Judge M.L. Tahaliyani told Kasab after he read out the order.“You have been given the death penalty for murdering Indian citizens, police officers, conspiring with Lashkar leaders and committing terrorist acts. The court has said while giving the judgment that you shall be hanged unto death,” Mr. Tahaliyani told Kasab. While the sentence was being read out, Kasab sat still, his face sunk deep in the cup of his palm. He listlessly waved when asked by the court to give an opinion on his sentencing. Anxiety drew him to ask for water and he had to be taken out of court. “
Shukriya saab [Thank you, sir],” was all the 26/11 convict could say on his way out of the courtroom.The court wholly accepted the prosecution's arguments for awarding the death sentence, noting that the “aggravating circumstances” fully outweighed the “mitigating circumstances.” It found that the defence could not make out a case for the lesser punishment of life.“In my opinion, the circumstances demand that death penalty be imposed in this case. The court has no option but to impose death sentence. This man has lost the right of getting humanitarian treatment,” the court observed.The court also referred to the Kandahar hijack incident triggered by the presence of the accused in the custody of the Government of India. Mr. Tahaliyani noted, “By keeping such a person alive there would always be a danger hanging over the government. He is a constant danger. He is a menace to society. He has no right to live.”The Indian Penal Code Sections under which Kasab has been given death penalty are: 302 (murder), 302 read with 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war), 302 read with 34 (common intention) and 302 read with 109 (abetment) read with 120 B.In addition, he has been given death for the offence punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. For the other offences, he was awarded rigorous imprisonment, simple imprisonment and imposed with fines.Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told reporters that a confirmation of the death penalty from the Bombay High Court was awaited. Kasab would continue to be housed at the high security Arthur Road jail till further orders by the government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Kasab-sentenced-to-death/article13797884.ece

Krishna, with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi during SAARC summit in Thimpu. Krishna told the Rajya Sabha that he will call up Qureshi on Friday to discuss bilateral ties.
  Setting the ball rolling for the resumption of dialogue with Islamabad, Minister for External Affairs S.M. Krishna on Thursday announced that he would speak to his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi soon after the end of the Parliament session on Friday.Mr. Krishna is expected to discuss the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Qureshi as well as between the two Foreign Secretaries. These interactions were agreed upon by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani in Thimphu last week to address the trust deficit between the two countries. Subsequently the two Foreign Ministers agreed to get in touch after the end of the ongoing Parliament session.Replying to clarifications in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Mr. Krishna was positive about the prospects of the two countries normalising their relations in the light of free and frank discussions between the two Prime Ministers.“An ideal situation has come about in transforming our relations. The mood, ambience, tone and tenor of the Pakistan Prime Minister were indeed encouraging and the Indian Prime Minister put across our core concern about terrorism.“I am sure in the light of these discussions by the Prime Minsters we are in the right direction in trying to create trust and harmony. I am sure that ultimately the whole region will stand to benefit from the thaw with Pakistan,'' he said.The Foreign Minister said the first steps towards reducing the distrust quotient by holding talks between the principals of the Foreign Ministries were being taken following Pakistan's assurance of “adequately'' meeting Indian concerns on terrorism.A meeting between the Foreign Secretaries in February this year was intended to send the message to the people of Pakistan that India believes in “open door, open communication policy.''Terming the beheading of a Sikh in Pakistan as “heinous and inhuman,'' the Minister pointed to the unequivocal condemnation by its President Asif Ali Zardari and his assurance of providing adequate security in keeping with his declaration of Pakistan being a pluralistic nation.Mr. Krishna said India was involved in reconstruction work in Afghanistan at the request of its government. “It behoves India that whenever such an invitation comes we should go there and do our humble bit…India is not militarily involved and our volunteers have gone there to help Afghanistan to be self-reliant and self-confident. No doubt there are elements not disposed to be happy with cordial India-Afghan relations. We have lost valiant men but let me assure you that our involvement is going to continue and not going to be deterred by such attacks,'' he declared.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Krishna-sets-ball-rolling-on-dialogue/article16298954.ece

Anyone who volunteers for the job can do it. Even if there is no hangman to be found, any police officer from the rank of a constable can also do it if he volunteers,” a Tihar Jail official said.Legally, the government can appoint a hangman either for short-term or as a permanent appointee.“If there is such a problem, it is only temporary. The government can either appoint someone on a short-term basis or permanently. Moreover, any jail official can also do the job if he wishes,” G. Venkatesh Rao, senior Supreme Court lawyer, who was also involved in the Indira Gandhi Assassination case said.It was in 1989 that Satwant and Kehar Singh, convicted in Indira Gandhi Assassination case, were hanged to death.The latest case of execution was of Dhananjay Chatterjee who got the death penalty for murder.Chatterjee was kept at the Alipore Jail for 14 years before his mercy plea was rejected by former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and he was hanged to death on August 14, 2004.He was executed by the 87-year-old hangman Nata Mullick in West Bengal. Mullick, whose father Shibal Mullick was a hangman in the British colonial days, died in December 2009.Major jails across India face an acute shortage of trained hangmen.Only men are employed for this job and the candidate has to be above 5 feet 4 inches tall.Other than the morbid nature of the job, the meagre salary also acts as a deterrent.

Kasab was convicted not on the basis of his confession but on the basis of the evidence gathered against him, Home Minister P. Chidambaram has said.
  Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday said conviction of Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab proved that the present laws were adequate to deal with the menace of terror. However, the government was open to “revisit” the laws if necessary.Replying to a debate in the Rajya Sabha on the functioning of his Ministry, Mr. Chidambaram said Kasab's conviction was not on the basis of his confession but evidence.The amended Unlawful Activities (Preventions) Act (UAPA) proved adequate for the prosecution and there was no need for separate provisions, as suggested by the BJP. “For the present, laws are adequate. They have broad support of all sections...Let's try these acts. If necessary, we can always revisit them.”Mr. Chidamabaram said while he respected the BJP's views, a large section of society, particularly minorities and SCs/STs, rejected these ideas as they feared their misuse against them.Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said though Kasab's conviction was a landmark event, he was disappointed because there were several other accused in the case living in Pakistan and the U.S., from where not much cooperation was forthcoming.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Conviction-came-without-anti-terror-law-Chidambaram/article16298874.ece

  The death sentence given to Ajmal Amir Kasab may take years to be executed as he could be the 30th in the list of prisoners who are waiting to be sent to the gallows.Thursday’s order by judge M.L. Tahaliyani is the first step of a long process which will include appeals before higher courts and most importantly, if he exercises his right, a clemency petition before the President.Judge Tahaliyani will send his judgement to the Bombay High Court for ratification under Section 366 of the Criminal Procedure Code.The orders of a lower court are generally challenged in a higher court by either of the parties but in cases of death sentences, the orders are mandated to be confirmed by the High Court.Once before the Bombay High Court, all the evidence will again be examined by it. The High Court will then decide whether to uphold the decision or to convert it to a lesser punishment.Even if the High Court upholds the death sentence given by the special court, Kasab can challenge it in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will again look at all the aspects of previous judgements, evidence, developments and arguments and give its final verdict.If the Supreme Court upholds the death penalty, Kasab can file a mercy petition before the President under Article 72 of the Indian constitution.At present, 29 such cases are pending before the President waiting a decision on their clemency petition.Some of the important names include convict in the Parliament Attack case Mohammed Afzal, who is at number 22 in the list of 29 such prisoners.Accomplices of notorious Veerappan — Simon, Ghanaprakash, Madaih, Bilavendra, accused of killing 21 policemen are at number 18, Babbar Khalistan Liberation Force terrorist Devender Pal Singh who was convicted of killing nine persons is at 17, conspirators of Rajiv Gandhi assassination Murugan, Santhan and Arivu of Tamil Nadu are also waiting a decision on their petition at number 13.Bantu from Uttar Pradesh is the last name in the list.Home Minister P. Chidambaram has already clarified that each case will be decided on the basis of number in the list of such petitioner.Based on such a premise, Kasab’s execution may take years to be decided.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Kasabrsquos-execution-may-take-years/article16299092.ece

Pawar, the lawyer who appeared for Kasab, said any accused has the right to appeal against the verdict if he is not in agreement with it.“I will not criticise the verdict. If an accused is not satisfied with the verdict given by a court, he can appeal in the higher courts,” Mr. Pawar told reporters after Kasab was sentenced to death for Mumbai terror attacks.When asked whether Kasab will file an appeal, he said he had not spoken to him regarding this. “I will be given an opportunity to meet him. Then I will ask him and then it (whether to file an appeal) will be decided,” he said.Mr. Pawar said he was satisfied with the way he argued for Kasab. “I believe that I have put forward points to save Kasab in the best possible manner. Whether it is accepted or not is a different matter,” he said.Asked whether he accepted that he was defeated, he said for a lawyer, arguing in a case is not like a “street wrestling” competition.He said after the pronouncement of judgement, the court allowed him to speak to Kasab to ask him about the judgement.“I asked him and he said, I have nothing to say,” Mr. Pawar said.The special anti-terror court of M.L. Tahaliyani pronounced capital punishment for the 22-year-old terrorist on five counts of murder, conspiracy to murder, waging war against the country, abetting murder and committing terrorist activities under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

  On May 9, when people across the country will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, Kolkata-based St. Xavier's School and College will join in the celebrations for its former student, whose association with the institution, though brief, was close to the poet's heart.Though the Nobel laureate strongly disliked the system of institutionalised education — resulting in his being home-tutored for most of his academic years — he studied at the school for almost two years; perhaps his longest stint as a student in any school during his lifetime, and penned down his memories of the period on several occasions.Organised by the Alumnorum Societas and the St. Xavier's College (Cal) Alumni Association, the celebrations will be marked by a recitation of Tagore's ‘Sesher Kobita' (Last Poem) by actor Soumitra Chatterjee and Dhritiman Chatterji in the presence of several noteworthy alumni of the institution.The programme will also coincide with the school's celebration of its 150th year of existence.Tagore was admitted to the fifth standard in 1875, at the age of 14, along with his elder brother Somendranath Tagore and nephew Satyaprasad Gangopadhyay. The St. Xavier's was the fourth and last school he attended before his father decided to home-tutor him.In one of his accounts, Tagore wrote about his disinterest in school education. “I could understand that my value in the civilised society is going down. But I can never connect myself with a school that shuts out life and natural beauty and conjures up frightening images of a prison or hospital,” he had said.His experience at the St. Xavier's School, according to him, was relatively happier. Though most teachers appeared to him as “mere teaching machines,” he was fond of a Jesuit priest, named Father Alphonsus De Peneranda, who had come from Spain and was appointed a part-time teacher.Tagore reminisced in one of his accounts that while most students in Father Peneranda's class were inattentive due to his lack of fluency in English, the poet felt a deep sense of empathy and respect for his teacher.Historians researching Tagore have found out from school records and accounts of his classmates that the school's annual calendar misspelt the poet's name twice as ‘Nobindronath Tagore,' that he failed in the fifth standard, that his roll number was 36, and that he came to school in a horse-drawn carriage.While Tagore left the school in 1877, he came back to his alma mater in 1931 to preside over a function organised by the teachers and students to collect funds for people affected by the devastating floods in Bengal that year.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Tagores-school-to-celebrate-his-150th-birth-anniversary/article16299038.ece

782,SC upholds Constitutional validity of MPLAD scheme,PTI,2010-05-06,11:07:25 IST,"The Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional validity of the MPLAD scheme under which members of Parliament are allocated Rs two crore annually for development of their constituencies.“We hold that the MPLAD scheme is valid,” a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said in a unanimous verdict.“There is no reason for us to interfere in the scheme,” the bench also comprising Justices R.V. Raveendran, D.K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and J.M. Panchal said.The bench, however, said improvements can be made in the working of the scheme.The bench said the mere allegations that the funds are prone to be misused cannot be a ground for scrapping the scheme.It said that both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have standing committees to monitor the scheme and there are various levels of accountability for its implementation.The apex court said that the scheme has benefited the local area development by way of providing water, electricity, infrastructure, library and sports facilities.It rejected the contention of the opponents of the scheme that it gives an unfair advantage to the sitting MPs against their political rivals.The bench said there is no reason to believe that the MPLADS cannot be implemented and monitored by the district authorities. The scheme is for the public interest and public purpose.The court said it was satisfied that under the scheme, there is no violation of separation of power.Interpreting Articles 282 of the Constitution, the bench said that Parliament validly holds power to disburse funds for the scheme.The scheme had come under judicial scrutiny after a sting operation in 2005 showed some MPs allegedly demanding money from contractors to award work for projects under MPLAD scheme. The expose had led to the expulsion of members from both Houses of Parliament.The MPLAD scheme had been in the news in 2006 due to allegations that trusts run by the then Election Commissioner Navin Chawla’s family got funds from the scheme.A three—judge bench on July 12, 2006 had referred the matter to a five—judge Constitution Bench observing that important questions of law needed to be settled.The scheme was first challenged in 1999 by Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party Chief Bhim Singh and an NGO, Common Cause, alleging that in the absence of any guidelines, the funds allocated under the scheme were misused by MPs.Later, petitions were also filed in various high courts and on the Centre’s intervention all the petitions were transferred to the apex court.Attorney General G E Vahanvati, who was then Solicitor General, had submitted that MPLAD Scheme is also a welfare measure implemented with the assistance of the local authorities like other schemes Jawahar Rozgar Yojna, Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme and Integrated Child Development Scheme.The funds under the MPLAD (Member of Parliament Local Area Development) Scheme were directly released by the Centre to the district authorities and it did not go directly in the hands of the MP, he had submitted.The Centre had defended the scheme, saying that it had the authority of law to release money under it as funds were withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India by passing the Appropriation Bill.The opponents of the scheme had alleged it was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution (Right to Equality) as it gave arbitrary powers to an MP without there being proper checks and balances, monitoring and accountability regarding the money being spent under it.NGO Lok Sevak Sangh had contended that the scheme gives an unfair advantage to serving MPs over their rival candidates in elections.The NGO had said the powers exercised or enjoyed by the MPs by virtue of MPLAD scheme results in discrimination between various sections of society in allocation of work.It was argued that though there is a provision in the guidelines that an MP who does not want to use his funds may withdraw from the scheme, it has not been done by any of them.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/SC-upholds-Constitutional-validity-of-MPLAD-scheme/article16298679.ece

  The New York Police Department (NYPD), learning lessons from the 26/11 Mumbai attack, has taken necessary steps to prevent any such type of terror attempt, a top US cop said today.“As part of our comprehensive response to what happened in Mumbai, we’ve held tactical drills and tabletop exercises with officers from our Special Operations Division based on that scenario,” New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in his testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.Mr. Kelly had testified before the same committee last year about the NYPD’s response to Mumbai—like terror assault in 2008, which claimed 183 lives.“As you may recall, that attack was carried out by small teams of operatives using AK—56 assault rifles. By sustaining the operation for hours, they maximised the casualties,” he said.NYPD has trained “more than 250 additional officers” in the use of heavy weapons to “supplement” the work of emergency service officers in a crisis.“We’ve also decided to use the instructors in our Firearms and Tactics Unit as another reserve force,” he said, adding that all of its police recruits would now receive basic instruction in three types of heavy weapons.“We’ve taken these and other measures because we believe an attack involving active shooters is always a possibility.Likewise, we must also guard against terrorists armed with homemade bombs, whether a car bomb like the one we saw in Times Square or stashed inside backpacks for a suicide mission like the one planned for last September in New York subways,” Mr. Kelly said.The officer noted that the department’s subway bag search programme is designed to counter terror threats like the 2005 London bombings.Mr. Kelly rued that their undercover operations showed the “ease” with which terrorists can purchase explosive ingredients such as chlorine and ammonium nitrate in the US.“These efforts are part of a robust counter—terrorism programme we built from the ground up in 2002, when we realised that in addition to our focus on crime fighting, the police department needed to build the intelligence collection analysis and infrastructure protection capabilities to defend New York City from another terrorist attack,” Mr. Kelly said.The NYPD had also established the nation’s first municipal counter—terrorism bureau and structured a intelligence division.“We recruited the best that the federal government had to offer to head those two operations,” he said.Similarly, the department had created a new civilian intelligence programme to support field commanders, who have tapped the “incredible” logistic diversity of the police department, with timely information and analysis.“We assigned native speakers of languages such as Urdu, Arabic and Pashtu to counter—terrorism duties. We strengthened our patrol of key infrastructure in the city, including bridges, tunnels and a host of landmarks and other sensitive locations,” Mr. Kelly said while listing out the measures taken after the Mumbai terrorist attack.A team of officials were sent to Mumbai to have first hand information of the terrorist operations there in November—December 2008.“We forged collaborative relationships with the private sector with law enforcement organisations up and down the East Coast and with federal agencies, especially the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security,” Mr. Kelly added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rsquo2611-Mumbai-attacks-help-New-York-police-to-be-better-preparedrsquo/article16298672.ece

The functioning of the Medical Council of India has come to a virtual standstill following the arrest of its president, Ketan Desai, on corruption charges.These amendments are expected to incorporate major changes suggested by the Ministry in the amendment Bill, tabled in 2005, which were turned down by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health.Sources in the Ministry told The Hindu it was keen that the government be able to intervene in the MCI in the “larger public interest” as did the Human Resource Development Ministry in the case of the All-India Council for Technical Education and the University Grants Commission under Section 20 (1) of the AICTE and the UGC Acts though these were nominated bodies. The MCI is an elected body with no such provision for intervention by the Centre. A provision for intervention was turned down by the Standing Committee on the ground that it would seriously jeopardise the independent working of the MCI and decision making of its president and vice-president.
Final decision
The proposed amendments to the MCI Act — if and as approved by Parliament — will continue until the government takes a final decision on whether medical education should come under the purview of the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) under the HRD Ministry or the National Council for Human Resource in Health being pushed by the Health Ministry.Meanwhile, the NCHER has invited a Health Ministry representative for its final meeting later this week.

From there, he is set to embark on a journey to his birthplace, where prohibitory orders have been issued and security heightened to avoid tribal unrest.Mr. Muivah reached Viswema village, near the Nagaland-Manipur border, on his way home to the Somdal village in Ukhrul district.Escorted by members of the Naga civil society, Mr. Muivah left the NSCN-IM headquarters, Camp Hebron, near Dimapur at noon after a brief prayer and arrived here to a warm welcome at the check gate on the National Highway 39. He was then escorted to the Viswema village, 25 km south of this town.Mr. Muivah was to stay overnight at Viswema, from where he had planned to go to Somdal on Thursday, said the Naga Hoho leaders, who are coordinating Mr. Muivah's entourage.The Nagaland police have provided Mr. Muivah with a bullet-proof vehicle, while security forces have been deployed on the national highway, a senior police officer said.At least 50 vehicles, mostly occupied by members of Naga non-governmental organisations, including women, escorted Mr. Muivah to Viswema.In a hurriedly convened press briefing at the NSCN-IM headquarters on Tuesday night, Mr. Muivah said he would go ahead with his planned visit to his village, which he said was agreed upon by the Centre.“I must go there and no force can stop me. My parents died waiting to meet their son.”He said he failed to understand why Manipur was objecting to his visit, adding: “The opposition to my visit came as a surprise...the visit is for peace, to meet family and friends and not to disturb anyone...We will not claim anything which belongs to the Meiteis [an ethnic group of Manipur], let them have theirs, we will only have what is rightfully ours.”The Manipur government has stepped up security and clamped prohibitory orders on the other side of the Mao inter-State gate to thwart the entry of the Naga leader.The NSCN-IM, one of the oldest and powerful rebel groups in the northeast, has been demanding a ‘greater Nagaland,' which it proposed be formed by merging the Naga-populated areas of adjoining States.

For, this place has been believed to be the birth place of Lord Ram by millions of Hindus for several centuries, senior counsel Ravi Shankar Prasad argued in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court.A Full Bench comprising Justices S.U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D.V. Sharma is hearing final arguments in the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. In the suits pending since 1989 Muslims sought a declaration that the area in dispute be declared a Babri mosque.After the completion of arguments on behalf of the plaintiffs in March, senior Supreme Court lawyer Prasad, representing the interest of Hindu worshippers, who claim as of right worship of the deity of Ram Lalla at Ram Janmasthan at Ayodhya, commenced his arguments on May 3.Mr. Prasad argued that in Hindu ethos and Hindu customary law, duly sanctified for the last thousands of years, “the concept of deity is a very distinguishing feature unlike in other religions. This deity is the manifestation of the Supreme Being which is eternal, permanent and omnipresent. The temple is the home of the god and the idol is a manifestation of the Supreme Being.”Quoting scriptures, he said: “The Hindus' concept of deity can also be shapeless and formless as they worship both Vayu and Agni. Even a log of wood or a piece of stone or the Sangam at Prayag, where — it has been believed by people for generations — a dip in the trinity of three rivers washes one of all sins, has also been exalted to the status of a deity. The Hindu concept is that a deity does not die nor is it subject to decay, and if an idol is stolen or is damaged or is defiled, a new idol installed [at the same place] acquires the antiquity of the old.”Counsel said: “The Ram Janmasthan fully answers the description of a deity held in reverence by the Hindus for the last thousands of years.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lsquoRecognise-right-to-worship-Ram-Lalla/article16298620.ece

  | Photo Credit: Sushanta Patronobish Announcing the induction of West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC) working president Subrata Mukherjee into the Trinamool Congress here on Wednesday, party chief Mamata Banerjee indirectly accused the State Congress of “conspiring” with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to break up the alliance between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress in the State.“The people's grand alliance has struggled against the tyranny of the CPI(M) for the past 33 years. Whichever party might conspire with and support the CPI(M), it is useless since the latter has lost all power…these agents of the CPI(M) will eventually realise that the real power rests with the people's grand alliance as those who flee from a battlefield are never respected,” Ms. Banerjee said.The Trinamool chief was speaking at a press conference where Mr. Mukherjee formally announced his decision to quit the Congress and join the Trinamool.Pointing out that her party is a “part and parcel” of the coalition government at the Centre and is committed to the alliance, she claimed that it had always tried to maintain the alliance and had worked hard accordingly.Exuding confidence about her party's prospects in the upcoming civic polls, Ms. Banerjee asserted that Mr. Mukherjee's decision to rejoin the Trinamool was “necessary for history, for change, for the State and its people” and appointed him the party's senior vice-president.Echoing Ms. Banerjee's words, Mr. Mukherjee said he had of late started doubting the Congress' intention of maintaining the alliance and felt “useless” in the party. “The truth is that it was a deliberate attempt to break the alliance. The CPI(M) has a major role behind it ,” he added.After functioning as Mayor of Kolkata under the Trinamool banner, Mr. Mukherjee had left the party and joined the Congress five years ago following differences of opinion with Ms. Banerjee.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Trinamool-committed-to-alliance-Mamata/article16298660.ece

789,Criminals may benefit but citizens' rights should be protected: Court,J. Venkatesan,2010-05-06,00:08:26 IST,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would be failing in its duty if it permitted any citizen to be forcibly subjected to narco-analysis, brain mapping and polygraph tests in violation of his privacy. Notwithstanding the fact that its judgment would benefit hardened criminals who had no regard for societal values, the court had a constitutional right to protect the rights of citizens.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said: “One of the main functions of constitutionally prescribed rights is to safeguard the interests of citizens in their interactions with the government. As guardians of these rights, we will be failing in our duty if we permit any citizen to be forcibly subjected to these tests.”
Unjustified intrusion
Irrespective of the need to expedite investigations in sensitive cases, no person, who was a victim of an offence, could be compelled to undergo any of these tests. Such forcible administration would be an unjustified intrusion into mental privacy and could lead to further stigma for the victim.“It must be borne in mind that in constitutional adjudication our concerns are not confined to the facts at hand but extend to the implications of our decision for the whole population as well as future generations.”The Bench said: “Forcing an individual to undergo any of these techniques violates the standard of ‘substantive due process' which is required for restraining personal liberty. Such a violation will occur irrespective of whether these techniques are forcibly administered during the course of an investigation or for any other purpose since the test results could also expose a person to adverse consequences of a non-penal nature.”
Inhuman treatment
On the contention that these techniques could be read into the statute within the ambit of ‘medical examination' in the Criminal Procedure Code, the Bench said such an expansive interpretation was not feasible. “It would also amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with regard to the language of evolving international human rights norms. Furthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered from these techniques comes into conflict with the right to a fair trial. Invocations of a compelling public interest cannot justify the dilution of constitutional rights such as the right against self-incrimination.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that a person could make an incriminating statement on being threatened with the prospective administration of any of these techniques. Conversely, a person who has been forcibly subjected to these techniques could be confronted with the results in a subsequent interrogation, thereby eliciting incriminating statements. While the scheme of criminal procedure as well as evidence law mandates interference with physical privacy through statutory provisions that enable arrest, detention, search and seizure, among others, the same cannot be the basis for compelling a person ‘to impart personal knowledge about a relevant fact'.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that an individual may give his/her consent to undergo the said tests on account of threats, false promises or deception by the investigators. For example, a person may be convinced to give his/her consent after being promised that this would lead to early release from custody or dropping of charges. However, after the administration of the tests the investigators may renege on such promises. In such a case, the relevant inquiry is not confined to the apparent voluntariness of the act of undergoing the tests, but also includes an examination of the totality of circumstances.

790,All radioactive sources of varsity irradiator accounted for: AERB,R. Ramachandran,2010-05-06,00:04:22 IST,"The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) has identified and accounted for all the cobalt-60 radioactive sources originally present in the gamma cell irradiator of the Chemistry Department of Delhi University.Stating this in a pres release here on Wednesday, the AERB said that the sources would continue to remain in the safe custody of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).It would be recalled that the irradiator, supplied by the Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) in 1968, had been in disuse since 1985 and was auctioned away to scrap dealers on February 26. This had found its way to the metal scrap market of Mayapuri in West Delhi. Without realising that there was a radioactive source in the scrap, two Mayapuri shops where the scrap had finally landed dismantled the equipment and cut open the irradiator into several pieces. This resulted in the people directly involved in the operation and handling the pieces to high doses of radiation. This caused severe radiation poisoning of seven people engaged in the scrap metal business one of whom has since died. The other six continue to battle for life – one at Apollo Hospitals and the rest at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.Following a complete survey of the market, officials of the AERB and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) stated that they located 11 radioactive sources in all — eight from one shop, two from another and one from an individual who was in its possession. Given the badly mangled state of the irradiator and its pieces, it was not clear then whether the 11 sources were all separate sources or were pieces of a single source. These radioactive materials were moved from Mayapuri in mid-April to the Narora Atomic Power Station (NAPS) in U. P.Detailed inspections of the materials recovered were carried out by the AERB officials at NAPS on May 3 and 4 following which the statement was issued. The statement clarifies that all the pieces originated from this single Delhi University gamma irradiator's Co-60 source. This also makes it clear that reports appearing in the media about ‘missing radioactive pencils' and the ‘source trail leading to Rewari (in Haryana)' were incorrect.According to S. K. Malhotra of the DAE, the reconstruction was made possible by the details of the original device that was supplied to the university in 1968, which the AERB managed to obtain from the AECL. Apparently the AECL responded to the query with great efficiency and supplied the details of the sale 42 years ago within a couple of hours. Mr. Malhotra also confirmed the initial activity of the source was over 3,000 curies (Ci). After 42 years, or 8 half-life periods of Co-60, the activity would have dropped by a factor of 2 to the power of 8, or 256, only. (One curie stands for 37 billion radioactive decays/sec.)According to the details provided by the AECL, the source chamber had provision for 54 pencils of Co-60 of which only 16 were occupied at the time of supply based on the requirements specified by the user. Each cylindrical pencil is made of 7 ‘slugs' or pieces of Co-60, each measuring about 2.5 cm x 0.6 cm stacked together and all the pencils constitute a unit that can be placed around any material to be irradiated with gamma rays. The AERB claimed that they were able to account for all the 112 slugs of the 16-pencil Co-60 source unit.In a related development, the Delhi University teachers' Association (DUTA) has demanded an impartial enquiry by the President of India, who is the Visitor of the university, into the callous disposal of the Co-60 source to scrap dealers. In particular, the DUTA has called for a enquiry into the constitution by the vice-chancellor of the committee that authorised its disposal and into the inexplicable silence on the part of the university authorities for as long as 20 days when the Delhi police and the AERB were groping in darkness to hunt down the origin of the radioactive material. “In this context, the speedy work by the Delhi Police in tracking down the origin to the Chemistry Department of Delhi University needs to be commended, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/All-radioactive-sources-of-varsity-irradiator-accounted-for-AERB/article16298577.ece

Doctors who attended on her said measles was the immediate cause for her death. She was admitted to the hospital on Monday. The doctors said Bency had the HIV encephalitis syndrome.The funeral rites will be held at a date to be declared later since the arrival of her maternal uncle is awaited. Together with her HIV-infected brother Benson (13), she was under the care of their blind grandmother at Kaithakuzhy near here. The funeral will be held under the supervision of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society.The body was brought to Kollam later in the eveningto be placed at the mortuary. A spokesman for the AIDS Control Society said a decision on how to handle the dead body before the funeral would be taken by the Society on Thursday. There is no harm in conducting the funeral as per Christian rites, the spokesman has said.Bency and Benson are children of AIDS-infected parents. Their father C.K. Chandy died in 1997 and their mother, Princy, in 2000. At the time Bency was 5 years old and Benson, 3. They then came under the care of their maternal grandparents. Their grandfather Geevarghese passed away in 2006.The siblings were one of the best publicised cases of HIV-positive children being denied access to school. The issue had attracted the attention of even the international media. Attempts by the grandparents to get them admitted in several schools were denied mainly because parents of other students threatened to withdraw their children from the schools if the siblings were allowed to study there.This compelled Geevarghese to undertake a fast in Thiruvananthapuram in 2003, which in turn resulted in the then Chief Minister A.K. Antony, calling a high-level meeting to solve the issue. Initially, a private tutor was appointed at their home and exams were also written separately.Later, as the constant campaign on AIDS awareness began producing results, the siblings were given admission to one of the schools that earlier denied them admission. Bency and Benson were presently studying at the Adichanalur Panchayat High School with other children. Bency was in Class 9 and had been promoted to Class 10.In September 2003, during an interaction with the siblings in Thiruvananthapuram, the then Union Minster for Health and Family Welfare, Sushma Swaraj, hugged them in public in an attempt to dispel myths and the stigma attached to the condition. On that occasion, Ms. Swaraj announced the public-sector Hindustan Latex would meet the educational expenses of the siblings for five years.

797,Muthalamada ‘mango city' goes hi-tech,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,19:51:55 IST,"Muthalamada in Chittur taluk, known as the ‘Mango city' of the State for its early mango harvest and large-scale export, is going hi-tech in sorting, grading, ripening, packing and export of mangoes.The first modern facility for mango processing and export in the State — Chittur Agro Park — began functioning in Muthalamada last week with technical support from the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bangalore.The Horticulture Mission Kerala has recognised it as a model unit for process and export of mangoes. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has provided financial assistance to set up the Rs. 50-lakh Agro Park. Mango growers can bring their product here and get them sorted, graded, ripened and packed for export or to send it to cities like Mumbai and Delhi for a good price.The Agro Park employs ethylene-based ripening , which is recognised internationally as a safe method for ripening fruits. The Park has ripening and pre-cooling chambers. This mangoes can be kept for three weeks without damage, said Becker Palliparambil, exporter of mangoes to the Gulf countries and the persons behind the new Agro Park.He said four tonnes of mangoes can be ripened at a time. The park will function round the clock during the season to benefit the farmers of Muthalamada and other places.Mango growers here had been using a lot of chemical pesticides to kill fruit flies, which rupture the outer skin of the fruit to lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the pulp of the ripe fruit. Deputy Director of Agriculture Department (Horticulture Mission) Jose Varghese says these insects can be effectively controlled by the new methods used in the Agro Park.At present, calcium carbide is widely used for ripening mango. In this case, the acetylene gas liberated is highly carcinogenic. This has to be strictly avoided. To get more orders and good prices in national and international markets, mango should be organically cultivated and ripened, he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Muthalamada-lsquomango-city-goes-hi-tech/article16298828.ece

799,100 injured in Kinaloor violence,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,19:48:20 IST,"About 100 people including policemen were injured in a pitched battle between the police and local people at Kinaloor, 24 km from here, on Thursday after several hundred protestors prevented a team of revenue officials from conducting a feasibility survey for a proposed four-lane road to the KSIDC industrial park located on the Kinaloor industrial park.The protestors had blocked the load leading to the estate with large boulders and timber logs in the morning when the officials, led by Revenue Divisional Officer K.P. Remadevi, arrived for the survey. Soon a pitched battle broke out between the protestors and the police and women constables were seen dragging women and children from the frontline of the blockade.The police resorted to a lathicharge to cow down the protestors and they responded by hurling stones at the police. Several protestors including women and at least one child were injured in the lathicharge. Several policemen sustained injuries in stone-throwing. The police used a grenade and teargas to disperse the crowd. They chased the protestors into nearby houses.The residents in the area have been questioning the rationale of laying a four-lane road to the park ever since a Malaysian government agency that had proposed a satellite city at Kinaloor withdrew from the project in September 2008. Also, there are rumours of a ‘land mafia' having purchased large swathes of land at Kinaloor in view of the Malaysian project.The police allegedly damaged a car and a motorbike owned by a persons after he refused to cooperate with policemen searching for fleeing protestors. His daughter told presspersons that the policemen used expletives and behaved in a menacing manner.Thamarassery Deputy Superintendent of Police Kuberan Namboodiri was among those who suffered major injuries. Among the 55 persons who came to the Community Health Centre at Balussery for treatment, 44 were police personnel.A protestor who sustained injuries on his back and left leg said several persons injured in the lathicharge did not seek treatment in hospital for fear of police persecution.The survey resumed after the police managed to disperse the protestors.Meanwhile, a tense situation gripped the area outside the estate when Communist Party of India (Marxist) activists and the protestors regrouped there. This time, the police preferred to watch the situation from a safe distance.The CPI(M) workers alleged that the protest and violence were orchestrated by outside elements. They said the policemen were provoked into lathicharging after the protestors sprayed a solution of cow dung on them.The protestors said they had only convened a Jana Jagrata Samiti on the occasion. “We blocked the team that came for the survey three times earlier. There were policemen then too, but no violence happened. This time, policemen were sent with orders to use force against us,” alleged a protestor.District leaders of the Congress, Indian Union Muslim League, Bharatiya Janata Party and the Solidarity Youth Movement soon arrived at the scene. The situation eased following Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan's orders to stop the survey. The Chief Minister directed the District Collector to submit a report on the incident.

  | Photo Credit: S_K_MOHAN The ongoing agitation by the local residents against a toddy shop at South Bazar here and the counter-protests by toddy tappers reached a flashpoint on Thursday. Irate toddy tappers, led by their union leaders, stormed into the venue of the agitation, destroyed the thatched structure erected by the agitators and opened the toddy shop that had remained closed for over 40 days.The toddy tappers reached the venue in a procession around 11.15 a.m. demanding that the shop, employing 30 toddy tappers, be allowed to function. Police personnel, outnumbered by the toddy tappers, were pushed aside and they remained mute witnesses to what followed.As the toddy tappers gave vent to their wrath, local residents at the venue ran to the safety of a nearby house. The workers then opened the toddy shop and measured the toddy brought there. The incident occurred after Sarvodaya Mandalam leader Thayat Balan inaugurated the fast by a resident expressing solidarity with the agitation.
Some injured
The agitators alleged that four women were injured in the assault by the toddy tappers. The union leaders claimed that a toddy tapper was also injured. A policeman also suffered injuries in the melee.The agitation began on March 23 when a group of local people came out against the shifting of the toddy shop from an old rented building to a new building, hardly 10 metres away, purchased by the co-operative society running the toddy shop. All efforts for a settlement came to naught as the agitators insisted that the toddy shop, which has been in the area for 42 years, will not be allowed in the locality.
Question of livelihood
The toppy tappers' union leaders said that the workers were just asserting their right to do their job. They claimed that the agitators refused to attend meetings to discuss alternatives. The workers could not be afford to be onlookers when they were denied their right to livelihood, they added.Kerala Madya Nirodhana Samiti activist T.P.R. Nath, who was at the venue of the agitation when the workers went berserk, said the agitators would discuss with supporting organisations the future course of action.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Toddy-tappers-agitators-clash/article16298825.ece

  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised to refer to an expert panel Kerala's plea for conferring ‘classical' status to Malayalam.The Prime Minister, who gave a patient hearing to the delegation led by Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy, Culture Minister M.A. Baby and poets O. N. V. Kurup, Sugathakumari and K. Satchidanandan, said while Kerala appeared to have a strong case, it was for experts to decide on the State's plea.“The Prime Minister gave us a warm welcome and patiently listened to our arguments. We are hopeful that this initiative by the Culture Minister and the State government would produce a positive outcome,” O.N.V. Kurup told The Hindu here on Thursday evening.“This is a very significant initiative by the Culture Minister which was long overdue. We look forward to some change. We will also continue to strive for securing classical language status for Malayalam,” added Sugathakumari.A language is accorded classical status if it is at least 1,000 years old, has a rich a literature and an independent literary tradition. Malayalam is the only South Indian language that has not been accorded classical status.“We are not asking for any relaxation in the criteria because we are confident that Malayalam does fulfil all the criteria. What we ask for is patient consideration of our arguments which, we are confident, no independent minded panel would be able to reject,” said O.N.V. Kurup.
Submits memorandum
In the memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister, the delegation pointed out that Malayalam had developed sufficiently much earlier than 12th century.Malayalam, the memorandum said, is as ancient as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada as it belonged to the Proto Dravidian family of languages. It was the language of the ancient ‘Chera' Kingdom, which underwent gradual transition like its sister languages, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu. For long, the word ‘Tamil' was a synonym for the word language. ‘In fact this served as a misty curtain to hide the antiquity of Malayalam Language,' the memorandum said and added that it was significant that Malayalam versions and commentaries of Sanskrit works were mentioned as ‘Tamil Kuttu' (Tamil book), an important example being the Malayalam annotation of the famous Sanskrit Lexicon, ‘Amarakosham' which was mentioned as ‘Amaram Tamill Kuttu'.The first available work in Malayalam, ‘Ramacharitham,' was proof of a rich heritage of poetic culture. Further, the present Malayalam script ‘Granthalipi' can be found in ancient Kerala writings from as far back as 9th century AD, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Panel-to-go-into-Keralas-appeal/article16298933.ece
802,State takes up NH issue with Manmohan,J. Balaji,2010-05-06,02:48:12 IST,"Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan led an all-party State delegation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh here on Wednesday and urged him to reduce the requirement for right of way (RoW) for National Highway (NH) development projects in the State to 30 metres from the proposed 45 metres.The delegation opposed the implementation of the projects in the State on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis as this would lead to collection of toll. The delegation wanted the Centre to invest in the NH projects directly. It sought adequate rehabilitation and resettlement packages for the evictees. They pointed out that in many stretches land was being acquired only on one side of the road and not in equal measures on either side. A width of 45 metres was too heavy a demand in a densely populated State like Kerala (with a population density of 819 per sq km). Moreover, religious institutions and historical monuments needed to be protected.Later, the Chief Minister told journalists that the Prime Minister had agreed to consider the request. He said that over 15 lakh people would get affected if the highways were expanded to 45 metres. There were lots of agitations and police actions which made the government to rethink on the subject after an all-party meet.Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy said the Congress, in principle, was not against the BOT package for NH 47 and NH 17. But the Centre had initially agreed to expand the highways with its own funds, he said.The delegates also urged the Centre to move the Supreme Court to get the stay given by the Karnataka High Court on night traffic on NH 67 and NH 212 connecting Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, vacated.Regarding the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, the delegates told the Prime Minister that though Kerala was committed to adopting the national pattern, it required some time. The Centre should extend funding to the State under the project without insisting on a change in the age of entry to school immediately. “As a transition management measure, the State may be allowed to convert Class I as pre-primary and the Centre may finance the expenses involved,” they said promising that in due course the age of entry would be changed to six.On the Kochi Metro project, the delegation sought early Central clearance with the participation of the Centre with the requisite external funding. They want this to be implemented on the Delhi metro formula and pointed out that the Centre need to spend only Rs.450 crore on the Kochi project.Among others, Ministers C. Divakaran, N.K.

  | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT I
n the few months since it has been on air, Surya TV's game show ‘Deal or No Deal' appears to have come up trumps for its exciting format, suspense factor, remarkable participants, glamorous models (who hold the cases with the money) and of course most of all, its affable host – actor Mukesh. ‘Deal or No Deal,' which recently completed 50 episodes and which airs on the weekends at 19.30, hinges on the decision-making ability of the contestants. The contestants have to figure out whether to call the deal offered by the banker or override the deal and continue playing for possible higher stakes. Mukesh, who is revelling in his second avatar as a game show host after his stint in ‘Kodeeswaran,' talks about the show to Friday Review. Excerpts from an interview…
Different formats of ‘Deal or No Deal' are aired in over 73 countries and perhaps in as many languages. What is different about the Malayalam version?
Apart from me, you mean? (Laughs). Just kidding. Actually, it is the participants who make the show the success that it is.They are simply superb. They are people with fascinating stories of life. They come from all walks of life – from fisher folk to teachers to scientists and what not, but what makes each of them so special is that they don't come here for the money or fame. Instead they come here to change their lives, change perspectives. For them winning money is secondary.
Change their lives, perspectives?
Well, for instance, in an episode there was a woman from Neyyatinkara who came on the show with her infant son with the hope that her missing/estranged husband would see the bubbly youngster and then want to come back home to them. Then again there was an 18-year-old who came on the show to request me to tell his father, a stonemason, that he (the father) should not spend his entire savings on alcohol.Likewise myriad such stories. The more I host the show the more I realise that it is all about human relationships.
What is your biggest challenge as the anchor?
Since there is a lot of one-to-one interaction between the contestants and myself, I have to constantly think on my feet. There is no script and you can never know what the contestants will ask/say. That's where my experience in mimicry, theatre, films and with life itself comes in handy.
How different is this stint as an anchor?
Being the host of ‘Kodeeswaran' gave me the confidence that I can do this one too. This time around, though, it is much more physically and mentally taxing.In ‘Kodeeswaran' I was comfortably ensconced in a chair asking predetermined questions and only crack a joke or two in between. Here I have to stand throughout the show and help contestants make their decisions on whether to deal or not to deal.
How do you help contestants make their decisions on something that appears to have more to do with luck than logic?
Actually luck only comes in the initial phase of the game. Once you go ahead its all about making the right decision at the right time. Of course, it is up to the contestant to deal or not to deal but I can be their support system and explain the pros and cons.

Veerappa Moily, replying to the debate on the Bill, said the Centre did not show haste in passing the Bill. Earlier, T.R. Baalu (DMK) said the Council was being revived in accordance with DMK's election manifesto in 2006.It was abolished by the MGR government with a political motive, he said, adding that Council could accommodate scholars, teachers, elders and other public figures for providing advice to the government.But M. Thambidurai (AIADMK) said the Bill was brought with a political motive to accommodate some persons as it was sure that the AIADMK was going to capture power in Tamil Nadu in 2011 Assembly poll.He said the Council was a symbol of British legacy and its revival was a retrograde step.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Parliament-nod-for-Council-Bill/article16298959.ece

Karunanidhi has made it clear that the government had no intention of closing down minority language schools or institutions in the State.Replying to special calling attention motion, he said Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa seems to have been misled by some journalists, who were looking to create friction between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.He could have sought clarification of the Tamil Nadu government stance with officials here before making a statement that the Tamil Nadu government was planning to close down minority language schools.The DMK had been in the forefront of protecting and saving Tamil and this was not at the cost of other languages. There was no change in this policy, the Chief Minister said, adding that he was making this clarification for the people of Karnataka.Earlier raising the issue, Peter Alphonse (Congress) and T. Velmurugan (PMK) pointed to Mr. Yeddyurappa's statement and wanted to know if the government proposed to close down such schools.Mr. Alphonse said that representatives of language minority institutions had approached him for clarification on the issue.In his reply, School Education Minister Thangam Thennarasu said the confusion could have been because the State government had taken a decision on equitable education in the State.This did not mean that the minority institutions would be affected in any way.

  Responding to a request from Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the Centre has allotted an additional 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice and 65,000 tonnes of wheat to the State.Replying to Peter Alphonse (Congress), Mr. Karunanidhi informed the Assembly on Thursday that he had made the request in the morning in New Delhi. “By the time I returned to Chennai in the evening, the order for the allotment had already reached Chennai.”Earlier, Food Minister E.V. Velu said the State normally received 2.96 lakh tonnes of rice from the Centre each month. Of this just over 65,000 tonnes was meant for distribution to Anthyodaya Anna Yojana families. This rice was supplied to Tamil Nadu at Rs.3 a kg. Another 1.04 lakh tonnes was given at Rs.5.65 a kg for Below Poverty Line families.For the remaining, the State paid Rs.8.35 a kg, which was the open market rate for rice supplied by the Centre (for 1.26 lakh tonnes). This was for above poverty line families. But, the intake had gone up, possibly because of the Re.1 a kg scheme of the government.The demand now stood at 3.17 lakh tonnes a month, he said, and added that this meant a significant deficit, which totalled to over 2.3 lakh tonnes per annum. The Centre had now allocated 2.5 lakh tonnes.Answering a question, Transport Minister K.N. Nehru said that the government was inclined to reduce the educational qualification for drivers from Class 10 to Class 8.
Order soon
An order to this effect would be issued shortly.The Minister said even for posts of government and transport corporation drivers it was not easy to find those who had completed Class 10.

  The Madras High Court has directed the State government to take up enumeration of heritage buildings in Tamil Nadu that have been listed in the report filed by the Justice E.Padmanabhan Committee.Allowing a writ petition filed by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), a Bench comprising Justices Prabha Sridevan and P.P.S.Janarthana Raja said that immediate direction must be passed to protect all such buildings/places in the State, wherever they may be and cited as an example the 150-year-old Kuthirai Vandi Court in Coimbatore that has become home to anti-social elements .The Bench restrained Life Insurance Corporation of India from demolishing the Bharath Insurance building without complying with regulation 22 of the Development Control Rules for the Chennai Metropolitan Area, 2004.
Directive to HCC
It has directed the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) to assess the value and feasibility of retaining the Bharath Insurance building. “As far as possible the building must be saved.The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and the Chennai Corporation, with the consultation of the HCC, shall issue directions for the protection of the building,” the judges said.The Bharath Insurance building, situated on Anna Salai, is an example of Indo-Saracenic architecture.Work on the construction of the building began in 1894 and it was inaugurated in 1897 as Kardyl Building, headquarters of ‘W.E.Smith & Co Ltd.'In 1934, it was sold to Bharath Insurance by Spencer's. Later, when life insurance was nationalised, the building and the company were taken over by the LIC.In 1998, the LIC initiated a process of eviction of tenants in the building on the grounds that it was unsafe for occupation due to its dilapidated condition.The HCC has been asked to recommend to the government steps to notify buildings listed by it as heritage buildings and within three months, cause notices to be issued to the concerned, especially the private owners, in respect of buildings listed by the Justice E.Padmanabhan committee so that there is no threat of demolition of destruction or alteration to such buildings.The Bench has asked the State government to issue rules to prevent persons from undertaking any repair, even in the name of renovation of heritage buildings without seeking the necessary approval of the HCC.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Restraint-on-demolition-of-heritage-building/article16298583.ece

812,"Prime accused absconding, 23 convicted in Bathani Tola massacre case",Shoumojit Banerjee,2010-05-06,20:07:25 IST,"A local court on Wednesday convicted 23 people for perpetrating the horrific massacre of 21 Dalits at Bathani Tola in Bhojpur in 1996.However, as with the April 7 verdict on the 1997 Laxmanpur-Bathe massacre, the notorious supremo of the Ranvir Sena and the prime accused - Brahmeshwar Singh “Mukhiya” - has been pronounced an “absconder” by the police along with five others in this case as well.A total of 53 people faced trial, out of which 30 were acquitted. The quantum of the judgement is to be pronounced on May 12.The carnage took place on the afternoon of July 11, 1996, when upper-caste landowners of the Ranvir Sena (a private militia of the landlords) stormed Bathani Tola in Bhojpur’s Sahar block and ruthlessly hacked 21 Dalits to death.The slain included women, teenage girls and babies less than 10 months old.An FIR was lodged against 33 people the day after the massacre. In all, the Bhojpur police framed charges against 63 persons in October 1996.The case was committed to the court of the Sessions judge on January 24, 1998, with charges being framed against 62 accused (one person had died by that time) on March 24, 2000.However, after the Central Bihar caste massacres violently concluded with the Mianpur carnage, the case against Brahmeshwar has been getting progressively murkier, with the police repeatedly failing to bring charges against the Mukhiya.Listed as an “absconder” by the Sahar police since 1996, no FIR, quite inexplicably, has ever been registered by the police against Brahmeshwar till date.The Mukhiya continues to be a non-FIR accused even after he was nabbed from Patna’s Exhibition road on August 29, 2002.While the government dithers on Brahmeshwar’s case fearing an upper-caste backlash this crucial election year, highly sceptical ponderings which surfaced soon after the Bathe verdict, are slowly turning into a cruel certainty in what is being constituted as “an open cover-up” on part of the government in Bhojpur judicial circles.“It is hard to fathom as to what is preventing the police and the government in bringing to book this criminal, who has been lodged in Ara jail since 2002,” said Special Public Prosecutor Mr. Rambabu Prasad, speaking to The Hindu from Ara. “This clearly shows that both the police and the government are not interested in ensuring that justice is meted out.”When questioned, the SP Bhojpur told this correspondent that Brahmeshwar did not stand trial as “certain court proceedings initiated against him were yet to be completed.”With the police’s failure to produce the “Butcher of Bathani Tola” in the Patna Sessions Court on April 7, a disturbing aspect of the case has been the repeated feigning of “confusion” on its part as to the status of Brahmeshwar’s investigation.The police has also conveniently the blamed the prosecution for failing to serve them notice regarding Brahmeshwar’s location.An absurd pretext, given that practically everyone in Bihar knows the Mukhiya to be safely ensconced in Ara jail for the last 8 years and counting.Meanwhile, Mr. Prasad said that he has filed a petition in the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Ara on April 19, urging the case against Brahmeshwar to be committed to the Sessions court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Prime-accused-absconding-23-convicted-in-Bathani-Tola-massacre-case/article16298833.ece
813,Jaipur hospital conducts successful bariatric surgery,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,20:03:21 IST,"Doctors at Fortis Escorts Hospital here have performed the first single-incision bariatric surgery in north India to treat a 31-year-old woman for obesity. The surgery for weight loss left only one scar and also treated the patient's related disorders such as acidity, insomnia, snoring and high cholesterol.Ajay Sharma, gastro-intestinal surgeon, said here on Thursday that the new laparoscopic surgery reduces the risks of infection, speeds up healing and helps reduce post-operative pain. The specialised surgical procedure was conducted here this past week for the first time in any northern State.A few attempts made for the single-incision surgery in Delhi had earlier failed. Dr. Sharma said the surgical technique required surgeons to learn specialised skills to perform the operation through a solitary incision against four or more in the traditional surgery, in which each incision has the potential to become infected and cause pain.Dr. Sharma said the woman patient weighed 98 kg and her body mass index (BMI) was 41 against 27 for a normal person. She did not get any relief from the regular yoga, diet control and fat loss medicines consumed for quite some time.Doctors at the hospital conducted tests such as sonography, liver function, thyroid and hormone profiles on the woman and concluded that her obesity could be controlled by bariatric surgery. A single 2.5-mm incision was made in the abdomen during the operation and the patient fully recovered within three days without any stitch marks or scars.Besides the removal of fat in the minimally invasive surgery, a portion of the stomach was detached to decrease the food intake and reduce the release of hormones responsible for deposition of fat. Dr. Sharma said the woman lost seven kg within 12 days and resumed her daily routine.The single-incision surgery was earlier performed at Fortis Escorts Hospital for gallbladder, appendix and hernia. Dr. Sharma said more weight loss surgeries though single-incision had been planned during this month after the first successful bariatric operation.Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gradually gaining ground in several other areas of medicine as well. For the obese people, the procedure leads to long-term loss of weight, recovery from diabetes, improvement in cardiovascular risk factors and a reduction in mortality.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Jaipur-hospital-conducts-successful-bariatric-surgery/article16298832.ece

Bangar said the party had urged the State Election Commissioner Dharam Vir to “intervene and uphold the Model Code of Conduct to ensure free and fair elections''.Dr. Bangar alleged that the State Government was “posting certain officials owing allegiance to the ruling party in key positions''. The INLD had drawn the attention of the election office to the fact that with the notification for holding the municipal elections on May 20 issued on April 26, the Code of Conduct had become immediately effective. Therefore no transfer of officials should have been made after the notification without the approval of the Election Commission.However, the Government had transferred O.P. Sheoran, Deputy Commissioner of Palwal, to Hisar as Deputy Commissioner. Dr. Bangar said this “transfer became even more critical in view of the fact that only a few days earlier Mr. Sheoran had been transferred from Hisar to Palwal. The latest transfer orders after the notification of the elections are obviously motivated with the intention of favouring the ruling party and also vitiating the peaceful atmosphere of Hisar''.He charged that in the past too the Bhupinder Singh Hooda regime had been misusing government funds to further the interests of the ruling party. This practice of using government machinery and funds continued unabated in view of the municipal elections. He accused the State Public Relations Department of “releasing advertisements to various magazines and journals with the intention of winning support during the polls''.The INLD has urged the State Election Commissioner to seek a report on all the advertisements that had been released by the Public Relations Department after the elections were notified and urged him to stop such release of funds immediately.The party has also brought to the notice of the State Election Commissioner a public notice published in a newspaper on May 5 informing the public that the Transport Department would issue 1,714 new permits and launch 860 new routes.The spokesman said this was a serious violation of the model code .The Election Commission has also been apprised of enrolment of bogus voters in Kurukshetra and Faridabad and action has been sought against the Deputy Commissioners/ Municipal Commissioners as the case may be.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/INLD-accuses-Hooda-Govt.-of-trying-to-influence-voters/article16298831.ece

I did not lose my nerve. I have no fear of Naxalites. One IG, two DIGs and an SP, thoughtlessly without planning, sent 76 troops for recce,” Mr. Chidambaram said, addressing students at a seminar in the Jawaharlal Nehru University, here on Wednesday nightHe said the setback meant that the country was confronting an adversary who is organised in strength.Later talking about developmental issues, Mr. Chidambaram said, “Dantewada has a police station which has only two policemen. When a policeman does not want to go there, how can you expect a teacher or a BDO to go there.”The Minister said that extreme ideology can be propagated in India. “Speech and propagation is free in a democracy but when they take up arms, the conflict arises.”He said there was no confusion about the aim of the Naxals. “The aim is seizure of political power with armed struggle. That is acceptable under certain conditions. Countries under colonialism took this path. Even India saw armed struggle to overthrow British.“There are situations when you are agitated or frustrated. I represent a backward constituency. Development has just started pouring in. If everybody has a justified right to take up arms, what will happen to the country?”He said the debate regarding whether development or police action should take place first in naxal-affected areas is “metaphysical.”“In West Midnapore, police action is needed first. In Gadchiroli, the district has been secured by security forces. Orissa is in a mixed stage, we have progressed in Jharkhand. It is a chicken and egg argument.“Maoists know development is a threat to them, so they demolish schools, 71 schools were blown up in 2009, they mine roads and blow up bridges. Villagers are killed in the name of being informers.... So to say Maoists are pro-development is a very naive argument,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Dantewada-operation-was-lsquothoughtlesslyrsquo-planned-Chidambaram/article16298795.ece

He waltzed at the crease here on Thursday with shots that were both graceful and inventive.The smooth-stroker was unbeaten with a 52-ball 73 as England won the first Super Eights duel of the ICC World Twenty20 by six wickets with three deliveries to spare.Chasing 148 after inserting Pakistan, England, guided by Pietersen's brilliance, managed to nail a potentially hazardous chase on a lively pitch. The innings was well-paced; only two runs were required in the final over.Earlier, paceman Stuart Broad and left-arm spinner Michael Yardy impressed as Pakistan was pegged back when poised for a surge. England, however, was let off the hook by Pakistan's sloppy catching.Saeed Ajmal grassed a regulation offering at mid-on after appearing to have the ball in control to reprieve opener Craig Kieswetter (on zero) off paceman Abdul Razzaq. Then, Ajmal put down Michael Lumb (on 23), left-arm speedster Mohammed Aamer being the bowler to suffer.And Razzaq failed to latch on to a return catch when Pietersen was on 21. It proved a costly lapse.After Kieswetter and the more fluent Lumb had powered England to a strong start - the openers put on 44 in 5.4 overs - Pietersen took charge.Crucially, he forced the Pakistani bowlers to alter their length. He danced down the track to convert the length to drive, loft, flick and glance both the pacemen and the spinners.He won the crucial duel against leg-spinner Shahid Afridi; the on-the-walk strike over cover reflected his urge to dominate. The manner in which Pietersen, using his feet, clipped Afridi displayed his balance and timing.Indeed, Pietersen was at his fluent best. The lofted six over long off - against the spin - off off-spinner Ajmal was high on the scale of difficulty.Paul Collingwood batted smartly, rotating the strike. England lost its skipper and Eoin Morgan towards the end but then Pietersen had inflicted too much damage for his side to be in any trouble.Earlier, Pakistan started in an emphatic manner with Kamran Akmal pulling the first ball of the match - from left-armer Ryan Sidebottom - over the ropes.The dangerous Akmal dazzled briefly before Broad, extracting good bounce from the pitch, consumed the batsman on the hook. Meanwhile, the left-handed Salman Butt, drove, sliced and flicked to the delight of the Pakistani supporters. Off-spinner Graeme Swann, a quality bowler, deceived Butt in the flight to terminate a promising innings.Yardy, quicker through the air with his left-arm spin, took out Mohammed Hafeez with a change of pace.Off the very next ball – it was the 11th over of the innings – Afridi set out for a non-existent single to cover only to be sent back by Umar Akmal. The Pakistan captain could not regain his crease. England had struck a body blow.Umar Akmal, a naturally free-stroking batsman, produced a few sparkling shots but Pakistan continued to lose wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq fell to an attempted reverse sweep off Yardy. And Umar fell to a sensational catch from Pietersen at deep mid-wicket when he attempted to muscle a short ball from Sidebottom. Pietersen, running with his back to the ball, anticipated to perfection.It was his afternoon at the Kensington Oval. Pietersen was rightly adjudged Man of the Match.

Brief Scores:

Pakistan: 147 for nine in 20 overs (Salman Butt 34, Umar Akmal 30; Michael Yardy 2/19, Stuart Broad 2/25, Ryan Sidebottom 2/28).England: 148 for four in 19.3 overs (Kevin Pietersen 70 not out, Michael Lumb 25, Craig Kieswetter 25; Saeed Ajmal 2/15).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Super-Eight-England-beat-Pakistan-by-six-wickets/article16299035.ece
823,"India, Australia set for Super Eights showdown",S. Dinakar,2010-05-06,20:38:19 IST,"A confident India face a stern test when they square up against Australia in their first Super Eights clash in the World Twenty20.
  The ball flew around at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday. There was good carry for the pacemen and the bounce assisted the spin bowlers too.This suggests strong back-footed players who can unleash the horizontal bat shots and those with hands that can harness the pace on the ball could be among the runs at the famous Kensington Oval.The venue that oozes character - cricket is very much in the air in these parts - will be the stage for the crucial Super Eights clash between India and Australia on Friday.The cricketers will not be short of inspiration. The immortal Garfield Sobers enclosure stands sentinel over the ground. It will be a big game for both sides. The side, which loses the first match will, in all probability, be under tremendous pressure to win its next two encounters.Much could hinge on how the Indian top-order fares against the Australian pace battery. If Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes can be prevented from making the early inroads, India can win.Tait and Nannes form the quickest new ball combination in the competition. This is a pair of contrasts that blends well. Tait, the high velocity slinger, complements Nannes, the sharp and skiddy left-armer.Will the influential Mitchell Johnson recovers in time from an elbow injury to his non-bowling right arm. If Johnson does not play, Ryan Harris, deceptively quick, will retain his place.The Aussie gameplan will be simple - use the short-pitched deliveries to disrupt the footwork of the Indian batsmen.Tait and Nannes are likely to rely on short-pitched stuff - while only one bouncer per over is allowed, the paceman can bowl any number of deliveries that forces the batsmen to fend off rib-cage – and push the men facing them to the back-foot.They can then strike with searing yorkers. This is a ploy that has worked against India in the past. Once the Aussies score early, then the spinners, including leggie Steven Smith, could be able to bowl under less stress.In a morning match – the game starts at 9.30 a.m. local time – toss will be a factor. The side that bowls first – there will be some moisture on the surface – could starts with an advantage.Openers Gautam Gambhir and Murali Vijay, a left-right pair, face a daunting task. However, the fact that both of them can play the cut and the pull might enable them to counter-attack. Yes, the Indian batsmen will have to disrupt the length of the Aussie pacemen.The in-form Suresh Raina and his ability vis a vis the short-pitched stuff will be under the scanner. He has to remove the question mark against his name when it comes to a particular form of attack. He occupies the vital No. 3 slot.Yuvraj Singh can meet fire with fire, respond with furious hooks and pulls. The mercurial left-hander appears to be getting his confidence back.India has depth in its ranks with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni capable of orchestrating remarkable turnarounds. Yusuf Pathan can strike the ball hard and long too but he could be probed with a barrage of short-pitched deliveries.Australia, though, lacks a specialist fifth bowler. The Indians would be looking at an opportunity here. The Indian bowlers will be in with a definite chance on this surface.Australia has firepower in its batting but then its top and middle-order came apart against Bangladesh before the cool and calculative Michael Hussey came up with a worthy innings under adverse circumstances.For India, left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan should be back in the attack and the bounce will enhance his cut off the wicket. Ashish Nehra, another left-armer, has been bowling a mean length at the death.Bowling in the end overs has been an area of concern for the Indians but Nehra has been operating with heart and tact.And Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla could pose searching questions to the Aussie line-up. The spinners could be among the wickets as well.The wicket of the imposing Shane Watson would the key strike for India at the top of the order. If Watson thrives with his big drives and pulls, India could be in real trouble.India suffered an injury setback when paceman Praveen Kumar was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament with an abdominal tear. Praveen will be replaced by Vidarbha paceman Umesh Yadav.

825,I was made a scapegoat by ICC: Samuels,IANS,2010-05-06,18:08:50 IST,"West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels feels he was made a “scapegoat” by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as he nears completion of the two-year ban for leaking team information to a bookie.In three days, Samuels will complete his ban from international cricket, and he maintains he did nothing wrong.“I am an honest person. My conscience would not allow me to come back if I knew within myself I had done something wrong,” Samuels was quoted as saying in Sydney Morning Herald.“They (ICC) need to spend time on situations like this; it is delicate and very important because you are dealing with players’ careers.”“When they looked at my case, they used me as a scapegoat, the ICC wanted to make an example out of me when I was never in a position for them to be able to use me as an example. The way they dealt with my case was very unfair,” he said.“I really didn’t have a case; when I went to the hearing I thought it would be just a fair process but it wasn’t like a hearing at all, I was just banned.”Samuels was charged with playing a part in fixing the first One-day international between India and the West Indies in Nagpur January 21, 2007. The allegations led to the ICC asking the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to conduct an investigation.At the disciplinary hearing, the committee considered evidence provided by the ICC’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) and excerpts of a recorded telephone conversation between Samuels and alleged bookie Mukesh Kochchar, which detailed vital match information being leaked by Samuels.Samuels was accused of leaking information like pitch conditions, the West Indies batting order and team strategies.The 29-year-old won’t predict if or when he might appear for the West Indies again but says: “I’ll just let my bat do the talking.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/I-was-made-a-scapegoat-by-ICC-Samuels/article16298789.ece
826,We can handle Indian spinners: Clarke,PTI,2010-05-06,15:40:55 IST,"Australian captain Michael Clarke
  On the eve of their crucial Super Eights match, Australian skipper Michael Clarke is not unduly worried by the presence of quality spinners in the Indian ranks, saying his batsmen are equipped to negotiate them.“India have got a lot of talent and they are a great side. They have some good spinners. Harbhajan is a world-class bowler. But then every team plays spinners differently and we are not perturbed. We have batsmen who can play spin pretty well. We will see how it goes tomorrow,” Clarke said.India have a flock of spinners in Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja and part-timers Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh who have proved effective in the past.The Aussie skipper though feels that spin bowling would play a big role in the tournament but sees equal opportunities for the fast bowlers and spinners as far as Friday’s clash is concerned.“Spin bowling is going to play a big part in the tournament. We saw in our win against Bangladesh that the spinners turned the ball a bit. So we can anticipate captains use their spin bowlers more often in the Twenty20 format.“The wicket here is good and the ground is wonderful. It is a lot different from the one we played in St. Lucia. But the nature of the wicket would be of no consequence as the result of the match depends on how the bowlers bowl and how the batters bat.“It depends on how the bowlers use the conditions and execute their skills. So, we are not thinking too about the wicket right now,” averred Clarke, adding “a score of 140 to 150 was defendable.”Clarke was satisfied with his team’s performance in the group matches, where Australia kept a clean slate by beating Pakistan and Bangladesh.“In the last two games we have done pretty well. We came back into the match against Bangladesh after losing six wickets for nothing. We are enjoying our cricket at the moment.Clarke said his boys were ready for the showdown in the Super Eights.“We have trained hard and our preparation has been spot on. We will focus on one match at a time and do not want to look too far into the future. We want to keep our game simple and not worry too much about what India could do,” he said.He did not rule out Mitchell Johnson, who missed the game against Bangladesh with a sore elbow, from Friday’s match.“The physio has been working on him. We will take a call on him tomorrow. But I think we have found a good replacement for him in Ryan Harris,” said Clarke.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/We-can-handle-Indian-spinners-Clarke/article16298732.ece
827,"Australia beat Bangladesh by 27 runs, qualify for Super 8s",PTI,2010-05-06,01:42:10 IST,"Australia produced a clinical performance to beat Bangladesh by 27 runs and qualify for the Super Eight stage of the Twenty20 cricket World Cup here today.The Aussies rode on Michael Hussey’s unbeaten 47 and Dirk Nannes’ four-wicket haul to drew curtains on their group campaign on unbeaten note after having defeated title holders Pakistan by 34 runs in their opening match.Australia now join Pakistan from Group A in the Super Eight stage and will take on India in their opening second round encounter on Friday.Michael Hussey played a sweet little cameo and shared crucial 74 runs with Steven Smith (27 off 18) for the seventh wicket to lift Australia to 141 for seven before Nannes (4/18) produced a breathtaking pace bowling display toNannes was ably supported by David Hussey (2/8) and Smith (2/29) at the middle.Captain Shakib Al Hasan top—scored for Bangladesh with a run-a-ball 28 while wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim (24 off 25) gave him the perfect support from the other end during their 48-run fifth-wicket partnership.Bangladesh made a mockery of their run chase as they lost four of their top-order batsmen inside the first four overs.Needing a outright win inside 19 overs to book their place in the Super Eight stage, the Bangladesh’s did not help their cause in any way and played insensible shots against some fine pace bowling to totter at 16 for four.Shain Tait (1/15)) and Nannes tested the Bangladeshi batters from the onset with their fiery and high quality fast bowling.Nannes, in particular, was the fiercesome of the duo as he picked up Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed and Mahmudullah during his three-over opening spell before returning back to account for the wicket Jahurul Islam (18).Inspite of the early jitters, Shakib and Mushfiqur put up a brave fight during their the fifth wicket to keep Bangladesh in the hunt.Shakib’s innings was finally cut short by a blinder of a catch at deep from Michael Hussey off Smith.Jahurul and Shafiul Islam (16 off 13) tried their level best to dig something out of the game but it was not to be Bangladesh’s day as Australia dished out a fantastic performance on the field to eventually romp home with eight balls to spare.Earlier opting to bat, the Aussies initially struggled as they lost six wickets for mere 65 runs before Hussey and Smith saved the day with the 42-ball vital partnership.After the initial hiccup, the Aussies added 59 runs in the last five overs, courtesy some fine hitting from Hussey and Smith.Australia did not have the ideal start to their innings as Shane Watson (4) feel early with Mashrafe Mortaza (2/28) striking in his second and innings’ third over.Watson mistimed a pull of Mortaza’s well-directed bouncer that landed in the hands of Ahmed.Captain Shakib (2/24) then ensured double celebrations for Bangladesh in the next over, picking up dangerman David Warner (16 off 11), caught by Ahmed.And then few overs later, a reckless shot from Brad Haddin ensured further trouble for Australia. He was easily caught by Shafiul off left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak (1/29) as he went for a lofted sweep over square leg.As if that was not enough, skipper Michael Clarke (16) was the next to depart, caught at long-off boundary by Jahurul off Ashraful (1/24) to see Australia stutter at 54 for four at the halfway mark.It could have been more trouble the Aussies had Jahurul not dropped a David Hussey sitter off Ashraful’s next ball.But Mortaza ensured that Bangladesh did not have to pay heavily for the dropped chance, picking up David Hussey in the next over to mark the departure of half of the Aussie side.Another well-directed bouncer from Mortaza hurried David Hussey into the pull, but the batsman could not control the shot and ballooned it to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur.Cameron White too failed to make any impact as Shakib outsmarted him with a lovely leg-spinner that turned away crashed onto his timbers.With chips down, Michael Hussey and Smith first played sensibly with ones and twos before opening up in the final five overs to take Australia to the fighting total.Michael Hussey took the onus on him to guide the Australia innings and picked up the tempo with a 17-run over off Mortaza. He hit as many as four fours and six during his 29-bal unbeaten stay.Smith too was not far behind as he used his long handle to great affect in the dying stages to register two sixes and a boundary against his name.

Brief Scores:

Australia: 141 for seven in 20 overs (Michael Hussey 47, Steven Smith 27; Mashrafe Mortaza 2/28, Shakib Al Hasan 2/24).Bangladesh: 114 all out in 18.4 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 28, Mushfiqur Rahim 24; Dirk Nannes 4/18).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Australia-beat-Bangladesh-by-27-runs-qualify-for-Super-8s/article16298627.ece

  | Photo Credit: K_Ananthan With campus placements improving and the economy looking up in the “spill-over” days of the recession, one would have thought that those who are about to start their undergraduate course will be happy about this trend and go with the flow.But, the student crowd that thronged The Hindu Education Plus Education Fair 2010, held for the first time in Coimbatore on Wednesday, told an entirely different story. Even with fairly good jobs and quality education in India, the 2,500-odd visitors to the fair stood testimony to the fact that studying abroad still remained a craze.Though the favourites of the day were Information Technology, engineering, biotechnology, management, and animation, there were universities and academies offering courses from dance and aviation to medicine and health studies, which too drew many enquiries. Of the 2,500, there were more than 1,200 students who registered, showing their earnestness about the course and university they were interested in.For such an enthusiastic turnout, the fair with 30-odd stalls comprising universities, educational consultants, and a bank, turned out to be a boon, offering options with many countries, universities, and courses, to choose from. Students and parents had to wait their turn at each stall to talk to representatives.A parent said she had to talk to representatives in most of the stalls because all the participants were genuine and not institutions which were of run-of-the-mill quality.The University of Bradford, the U.K., with its bachelors, masters' and research programmes in health studies, informatics, and life sciences, Birmingham City University, the U.K., with its job-ready vocational programmes in automotive, and mechanical engineering, and Stratford University, the U.S., with its special focus on telecommunications and software engineering, were a big draw.University of Alabama, Huntsville, the U.S., was promoting the two five-year integrated programmes for undergraduates – Mechanical Aerospace Engineering, and Business Management. Representatives of RACUS, a private organisation representing Russian State universities, said the universities were offering medical and dental courses for 20 per cent of the total fee. “The Russian Government bears 80 per cent of the fee for international students,” Maria Postolovskaya, said. Hence, a candidate with only 50 per cent aggregate and with no GRE score could do a course in medicine, dentistry, business management, or engineering, in a Russian State university.Just like any other stall, eager parents swarmed the stall put up by State Bank of India (SBI) keen to know about the education loans available for students going abroad.S. Venkataraman, Regional Manager, Region I, SBI, said for students going abroad the loan amount went up to Rs. 20 lakh at 11.75 per cent interest. “This will be given against a collateral. Students get a grace period of a year on completion of the course. After that they are given a seven-year repayment period,” he said. Many walked out with the options they needed to make the right decisions to join the bandwagon of Indians studying abroad.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Ardour-for-going-abroad-for-higher-studies-still-in-vogue/article16298590.ece

Chinnaswamy Avenue in Ward 1 of the Coimbatore Corporation say they are going the worst time yet in terms of drinking water supply under the Pilloor scheme for over two months.The layout is among the many that fall under the North and East zones of the Corporation that are struggling for water.Official sources say that with the bulk of the city's new regularised layouts located in these zones, the residential colonies have been pushed into a phase of scarcity from that of abundance.The areas coming under the Pilloor scheme were envied by those in the Siruvani scheme areas because the former enjoyed a sustained allocation of 65 million litres a day throughout the year. But, the monsoon determined the quantity of supply in the Siruvani areas.But, the residents in Wards 1 and 2 say that water adequacy was a thing of the past. Now, it is a tough struggle.“Every day, at least 10 women walk to the Corporation's overhead tank near our colony in a desperate search for water,” says secretary of T.N. Chinnaswamy Avenue Welfare Association K. Ramachandran.Ward 1 councillor K. Chandrasekar says: “It 13 days (till May 4) since we got water supply. When we take this up with the Corporation water supply staff or officials, they cite power shutdown as the reason. Three hours of power cut has a direct effect on the areas where water has to be pumped to from the water tank.”Ward 2 councillor D. Jothimani too has a similar complaint. “We get water only once in 10 days,” she says. “And, there is no solution to this problem though we have taken it up with the water supply wing of the civic body.”Mr. Chandrasekar wonders how Avarampalayam gets water once in five days and not Wards 1 and 2 that were not very far away.Mr. Ramachandran says the residents are even more upset with the water supply staff for not informing of the probable supply time.“The supply is made at 11 p.m. If we know of this in advance, we can stay awake. Otherwise, we will never know of the supply.”Even in the case of disruption in Pilloor supply because of problems in the supply line such as leaks of bursts, the residents say that they should know when the supply will be restored in their respective layouts after the supply in the main line is restored.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Water-supply-erratic-say-residents/article16298584.ece

836,Need to modernise Delhi Police: Sheila,Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar,2010-05-06,02:28:36 IST,"The need for and the variety of power of the Delhi Police that could be brought under the Delhi Government were discussed at length on Wednesday at a conference on the Delhi Police (Amendment) Bill, 2010, organised at Delhi Secretariat.Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who chaired the conference, said: “We were keen on a discussion before bringing in the Bill and a lot of good suggestions were made at the meeting which would be incorporated in it.'' Stating that this was the first public interaction on the issue and a lot of inputs were received, she said, “I am in favour of another round.''Ms. Dikshit said all the suggestions would be considered in setting up a mechanism in which the Delhi Government would have a role in various aspects of policing. “It is all about how better we can serve Delhi, which is widely perceived as not a safe city,'' she said.The Chief Minister said the reasons for crime in Delhi are many including its porous borders. But since it is a special city being the Capital of the country and has a large diplomatic corps, there is a strong need to modernise the force. Also, she said, a department is needed within the Delhi Police for social service-oriented work and for identifying and rectifying problems that affect the society.The conference was attended by a number of Delhi Ministers, BJP MLA Sahab Singh Chauhan, Chief Secretary Rakesh Mehta, Union Home Secretary G.K. Pillai, Principal Secretary (Home) G.S. Patnaik, Commissioner of Delhi Police Y.S. Dadwal, former Supreme Court Judge Arijit Pasayat, and lawyers, retired bureaucrats, heads of various departments and representatives of residents' welfare associations.The need for the discussion arose as the Delhi Government has prepared a legislative proposal for the Delhi Police (Amendment) Bill, 2010, to implement the direction of Supreme Court in the matter of Prakash Singh and others versus Government of India and others.The proposal was uploaded on the website of the Delhi Government at www.delhi.gov.in inviting public views and suggestions to arrive at a broad consensus. At the conference, there was general consensus on transfer of traffic matters and other non-core functions to the Delhi Government. Besides, the Delhi Police was called upon to implement social legislation.It was also stated that other issues such as the term of Police Commissioner and other officers, functioning of the Screening Committee and Scrutiny Committee, constitution and supervision of Police Appellate Authority in each district and Thana Committees at the police station level be brought under the Delhi Government.The Second Administrative Reforms Commission had expressly recommended that the Union Government may retain control over the broader aspects of security and law and order whereas traffic and enforcement of special laws could be handed over to the Delhi Government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Need-to-modernise-Delhi-Police-Sheila/article16298655.ece
837,City to have National Institute of Urban Management,PTI,2010-05-06,18:25:33 IST,"The city will soon have its own National Institute of Urban Management — a world-class institute jointly run by Andhra Government and Centre to train managers to face the growing challenges of urbanisation.The NIUM would come up on a 20-acre site at Khanamet village in Ranga Reddy district on the outskirts of Hyderabad.The state cabinet, which met here on Thursday under the chairmanship of Chief Minister K. Rosaiah, approved a proposal to allocate the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority land free-of-cost for NIUM.Currently, the National Institute of Urban Affairs is being run as an autonomous institution in New Delhi with the support of the Union Ministry of Urban Development.It is a premier institute for urban policy research, training and information dissemination in urban development and management.“NIUM will be a premier institute for training urban managers in tune with the growing challenges of urbanisation,” state Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Aanam Ramanarayana Reddy told PTI.While the Centre would contribute Rs 50 crore, the state government would spend Rs. 15 crore for building the NIUM and setting up the training facilities in the first year.“The World Bank will contribute another Rs. 20 crore for the project,” the Minister added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/City-to-have-National-Institute-of-Urban-Management/article16298794.ece
838,Taking the eco-friendly path,M. Sai Gopal,2010-05-06,00:25:31 IST,"A common plastic pipe used to drain out water morphs into a stunning village belle. A multipurpose galvanised iron wire now stands tall as a farmer with a plough on his shoulders. At another corner of the wall, a piece of thermocol has been turned into an exquisite clay model of Radha-Krishna, imitating art on wood complete with fine engravings.The clay used to mould these three-dimensional figures is unique. Unlike normal clay models, which develop cracks, do not have solidity and need to be ‘fired' in a kiln, this clay does not require any special treatment.To top it off, it is eco-friendly and no chemicals have been used in its preparation.The studio of artist K. Muralidhar at Sindhi Colony has loads of such astonishing clay models, moulded by using things which are usually discarded to a bust-bin.The empty box of a talcum powder now has a clay face on it and can be used as a paperweight. A used towel has been expertly moulded, by using the clay, into wavy curls of a woman.“Such artwork is usually done with plaster of Paris, cement or adhesives like an M.seal”. Normal clay does not bind and cracks develop immediately. I have prepared this eco-friendly clay without any chemicals. The colours being used in the artwork are also natural,” says Muralidhar.To prove the environment friendly nature of his clay, Muralidhar grows decorative plants at his art studio, by using the clay, in small pots. The artist has done lot of research on how to prevent clay models from developing cracks, make them light weight and without using furnace or a kiln to heat.“I have used grounded cotton powder to prevent cracks and wood powder to make clay light in weight,” he reveals. The clay is soluble and artworks can be recycled by dipping in water. “If you are not happy by the finished artwork, just dip it in water and start again,” he says. He can be reached at 98665-72242 or on his blog ‘www.muraliarts.blogspot.com'.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Taking-the-eco-friendly-path/article16298580.ece
839,"3,000 habitations face water scarcity",B. Chandrashekhar,2010-05-06,00:24:08 IST,"The drinking water situation in rural areas across the State is alarming due to depletion of water availability and drying up of sources.Authorities of the Rural Water Supply Department admit that about 38 lakh people in nearly 3,000 habitations, mostly in Telangana region, are facing drinking water scarcity.Some district Collectors, at whose disposal the State government has kept sufficient funds to tie over the situation, have been found wanting in taking the call to meet the demand in several districts. As a result, people in most of the affected habitations are being forced to manage with a meagre supply of 15 litres per capita per day (LPCD) against the WHO-standard requirement of 40 LPCD.“The WHO norm means water requirement of a person for all his needs in a day. But, we (RWS Department) are supplying water only for drinking and cooking needs”, officials of the department argued. Summer has put severe stress on water sources resulting in 154 protected water supply schemes becoming defunct and 15,009 borewells getting seasonal.When contacted, Deputy Chief Engineer of RWS B. Surender Reddy told The Hindu on Tuesday that drinking water was being transported to 2,939 habitations as on May 4 due to shortfall in yield (1,091), drying up and depletion in the water quality (1,831) and power supply problem (17). Need of 1,831 habitations was being met by hiring private sources like agricultural borewells.Shortfall in water yield in sources was high in Chittoor (374 habitations), Karimnagar (115), Srikakulam (110), Adilabad (81), Krishna (65), Kadapa (53), Warangal (46), Medak (41), Nizamabad (39) and Khammam (31), whereas drying up of sources and depletion in quality was more in Warangal (902), Chittoor (499), Nalgonda (310), Karimnagar (282), Medak (151), Adilabad (132), Nizamabad (119), Kadapa (117), Srikakulam (113) and Khammam (71), he explained.Shortage of staff has also become a bottleneck in meeting the demand in some districts like Nizamabad, where only 15 per cent of the sanctioned strength was available. Of the a sum of Rs. 57.53 crore released to Collectors for taking up contingency measures in scarcity habitations only Rs.16,67 crore has been utilised so far. Besides, Rs. 25 lakh each legislators' ACDP fund has also been allocated for the purpose.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3000-habitations-face-water-scarcity/article16298578.ece
840,Bringing back a cultural metaphor,J. S. Ifthekhar,2010-05-06,00:22:50 IST,"Years roll back and time seems to stand still. Hyderabad's founder, Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, reclines on his throne with the royal guards in attendance. The poets are seated in a semi-circle on spotless white ‘chandnees'. The air is rife with expectation as the ‘shama' is placed before a poet.Yes, one is transported back in time as a typical mushaira of the Quli Qutb Shah days comes alive. Mushairas figure at the top on the cultural calendar of Hyderabad, but this one is different. It is a throwback to the olden times when aesthetic values had not yielded place to crass commercialisation.An earnest attempt was made the other day by artistes belonging to “Aiwan-e-Fankar” to bring back the glory of mushairas of yore. They tried to trace the journey of the ‘ghazal', capturing the typical ambience, the rich blend of thought and feelings. Not just this. Artistes donned period costumes complete with flowing beards and long tresses to play the roles of great poets like Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Daag, Jigar, Hasrat Mohani down to the recent greats like Shaz Tamkanat and Maqdoom Mohiuddin.For most part, the history of Urdu poetry is the story of the Urdu ghazal. But the current generation brought up on MTV has neither the taste nor interest to appreciate the nuances of shayari. “We want to present the greatest of Urdu poets in their original style. And also to show how mushairas were actually held earlier,” says Javeed Kamal, the man behind ‘Tamseeli mushaira'.Sure, this is a fairly good attempt to revive interest in the institution of mushaira. Interestingly, it seeks to treat the audience with the best of Urdu ghazals from the best writers of the genre. Mr. Kamal has shot the two-hour concert and it will be soon available in CD format. Urdu lovers can now watch the legendary poets recite from the comfort of their homes.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Bringing-back-a-cultural-metaphor/article16298576.ece

842,Traumatic moments for kin of rag-pickers,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,00:20:12 IST,"As four poclains rummaged through the mountains of garbage at the Jawaharnagar dumping yard, rag-picker Shanmuga sat there silently praying that his son is found alive.His son, Vaasu, along with two others, Khaja, 15, and Mohd. Raheem, 22, got buried alive under the heaps of garbage three days ago. Shanmuga believed that some miracle would bring back his son alive. His hopes were shattered as a poclain operator stumbled upon a severed body.Families of the three victims ran there to see who it was. Shanmuga collapsed on seeing that the severed body was that of his son, recognising it by the colour of the trousers and innerwear that he last wore.“Probably, the huge steel hook of the poclain hit the body severing it,” the police said. Vaasu was the only son of Shanmuga. His mother died few years ago. Theirs was one of the nearly 100 rag-picking families living near the yard, picking plastic from garbage and selling it for recycling.Shanmuga cried inconsolably on seeing his son's body refusing to leave the place till his son's head was found. The police sent him away convincing him that searches in the night would not be helpful. Family members of Raheem and Khaja too underwent equally tense moments as the bodies of their beloved ones could not be traced.Sania, wife of Raheem, went to Moosarambagh on Monday to see her ailing mother when she learnt that her husband got trapped in the garbage. They got married a year ago. The shell-shocked woman sat at the yard as searches continued for the last two days.Officials restricted rag-pickers from entering the dumping yard when a rag-picking woman, Nagamma, 42, died after heaps of garbage fell on her 10 days ago. “This meant no work and no food for us. Apparently, my son Khaja was worried about the family's fate and ventured into the yard in the night looking for plastic along with the other two,” Khaja's mother Sabera Begum said.

843,EAMCET: certificate verification to begin early,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,00:19:17 IST,"Officials are toying with the idea of verifying the certificates of EAMCET aspirants soon after the results are released instead of waiting till the actual process of counselling starts.The idea is to cut down the time and ensure that certification is not done in a hurry. This year the announcement of final ranks is likely to be delayed and done only in the second week of July. Officials want to announce the results taking into consideration the marks obtained in the re-verification of scripts and recounting of marks obtained in the advanced supplementary examinations.Officials said since verification of certificates has nothing to do with ranks obtained they want to advance the process. Last year, verification was done in 59 helpline centres across the State, and this year the number may be increased as new centres have been added in two more districts.If a final decision is taken the process is likely to start in June second week after the marks of EAMCET are announced.

  | Photo Credit: G_Karthikeyan With effective intervention of government hospitals and good support and coordination from the NGOs and Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres, the rate of spreading of HIV among people had come down to 0.025 per cent from 1.36 per cent, said T. Jayabal, Joint Director of Health Services.He was addressing an AIDS awareness seminar meant for HIV affected persons, nurses and volunteers held here on Wednesday.Approximately four million people have been living with HIV in the world including in African countries, top in the world in having highest number of HIV patients. India's position was number two in this list but it was number one in controlling the disease.Dindigul district alone had over 8,000 persons living with HIV. Only 3,411 patients had registered with Anti-Retroviral Therapy Centre of which 1,678 patients got regular treatment. Besides, 89 children too were also treated at the ART centre, Dr. Jayabal pointed out. The Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society had offered Rs.1.38 lakh to meet their educational needs, he added.He appealed to all persons living with HIV to register their names with the ART centre and avail its care and support services. The non-governmental organisations, volunteers and village health nurses should strive hard to include those who had not registered their names with the ART centre.Early detection of HIV, prompt diagnosis and treatment would certainly ensure reduction of morbidity and mortality of the infected and quality of life of the affected could also be improved. Effective management of the disease would also help delay the progression of the disease. The ART centre in Dindigul GH had all facilities and equipments required to test the patients. Patients need not go to Madurai for diagnosis and tests. The GH had even a legal cell for AIDS patients to protect their rights, he added.In his special address, Tamil Nadu Health System Project Coordinator A. Asai Thambi said that persons aged below 50 years alone were mostly affected by AIDS. Weakening the youth population will have a direct impact on the economic development and growth of the nation, he added.Speakers stated that HIV cases were on the rise in Oddanchatram, Nilakottai and Batlagundu.

846,High Court staff see light at the end of the tunnel,Mohamed Imranullah S.,2010-05-06,02:23:22 IST,"Madras High Court employees here demanded an exclusive housing colony in 2004; works for identifying the land began in 2005 and officials zeroed in on a 3.7-acre site opposite to the Maatuthavani Integrated bus terminus in 2006.Thereafter, a building plan was drawn in 2007 for constructing 16 ‘A' type apartments, 48 ‘B' type, 112 ‘C' type and 96 ‘D' type apartments along with a play area and other amenities. Nevertheless, there was a slump in the progress of the project for a year.In June 2008, a Lok Adalat comprising the Law Minister Durai Murugan, the then Chief Justice of the High Court A.K. Ganguly and the then Chairman of the Law Commission AR. Lakshmanan directed the Government to complete the project, preferably, by the end of year.A few months thereafter, it was announced that the construction would be taken up by the Public Works Department (PWD) instead of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). A foundation stone laying ceremony was held at Court Hall No.1 of the High Court Bench on November 1, 2008.The PWD, in February 2009, submitted a revised estimate to the Government to hike the project cost from Rs.19.38 crore to Rs.25.2 crore in view of escalation in prices of construction materials and considering the changes made by the High Court to the original building plan.The court had insisted on leaving vehicle parking space in the ground floor. Therefore, it was decided to construct four-storey buildings instead of three-storeys as it was planned originally. The sanction for the revised estimate got delayed due to the Parliamentary elections.After three months, a Government Order was issued in June 2009 granting sanction for Rs.25.2 crore.Subsequently, the PWD kickstarted the process of calling for tenders for various works and finalised the contractors even as the High Court staff waited with bated breath.At last, the court employees were able to see some light at the end of the tunnel on Monday when the officials brought a set of bricks and a bag of sand to the construction site, for the first time, to conduct a ‘bhoomi puja' .Having waited for nearly six years, the staff now only hope and pray that the buildings would come up within 15 to 18 months without any further delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/High-Court-staff-see-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/article16298653.ece
847,Vaiko voices concern over dam issue,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,02:20:16 IST,"Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko on Wednesday criticised the Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi, for not allowing Parvathiammal, mother of Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam leader, V. Prabhakaran, to enter Tamil Nadu to get medical treatment.He was addressing a public meeting here to highlight the proposed agitation blocking all roads leading to Kerala on May 28.Reacting to Mr. Karunanidhi's contention that he was not aware of Ms. Parvathiammal landing at Chennai airport, Mr. Vaiko questioned how a huge posse of police personnel was deployed at the airport before the flight could land. “Did the police come there without the Chief Minister's knowledge? Why did the police block me and P. Nedumaran (convenor of Mullaperiyar Dam Rights Retrieval Committee) from entering the airport though we had visitors' pass with us,” he said.He also condemned Mr. Karunanidhi for his argument that Ms. Parvathiammal was denied entry into Tamil Nadu as she was blacklisted by the Centre based on a recommendation made by the former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa. “If Ms. Parvathiammal was blacklisted, the Indian embassy in Malaysia could not have issued her a visa enabling her to visit India,” Mr. Vaiko said.Mr. Karunadhi always had the liberty to reverse the previous Government's decision on allowing Ms. Parvathiammal, considering her condition, he said. He sought an apology from the Centre and the State for their “inhuman” act against an ailing aged woman.On the dam issue, Mr. Vaiko said he had little hope that the Supreme Court could render justice to Tamil Nadu. He said that people of Tamil Nadu could not nurture any faith on the apex court that had reversed its own three-member bench verdict on the dam row by constituting a five-member committee to study the stability of the structure. He wondered what the panel was going to do after two Central committees had certified the stability of the dam and after which the Supreme Court allowed the level to be raised to 142 feet.He wanted the people of Tamil Nadu to participate in large numbers in the May 28 road roko in the interest of the future generations of the five districts benefited by Periyar dam. “If we failed to check Kerala Government in its plan to decommission the dam, these districts would become a desert,” he said.Mr. Nedumaran said that the Chief Minister could have put pressure on the Centre to implement the Supreme Court verdict on the dam issue citing the unrest caused in the State by the Opposition parties.Communist Party of India's State deputy secretary, C. Mahendran, warned that nationalism should ensure that every citizen was equally treated.

848,Pudhurai Vannars seek community certificates,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,02:16:12 IST,"For a few members belonging to the Pudhirai Vannar caste, obtaining community certificates has become more than an uphill task. The members have been running from pillar to post for months together representing their case in the grievance meetings but all in vain.S.Pechiammal and M.Alagarsamy of Pudhupatti, A .Muruganandam, Ettimangalam near Melur, K.Murugan, Keeraithurai and V.Murugan, Vavval Thottam have submitted petitions to the Adi Dravidar Tribal Welfare Minister, District Collector and Revenue Divisional Officer.V.Murugan, member, Tamil Nadu Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board, says “for the above said members of Pudhirai Vannar caste it is stated so in their school certificates but community certificates are not issued to them.” When enquired in the office of Adi Dravidar Welfare Department, all that Murugan and his fellow caste members were told was that it was stopped 15 years ago.The community members alleged that certificates were given randomly; in most cases, anyone among the family holds a certificate but when asked for others in the family the authorities are reluctant to issue them.According to government records, the Pudhirai Vannars are one among the 76 Scheduled Castes. The name, Pudhirai Vannar, is listed 60th in the Tamil Nadu list of Scheduled Castes, as laid out by the Scheduled Castes (Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into effect from July 27, 1977.However, the state authorities do not easily issue community certificates in the name of Puthirai Vannars. Mr.Murugan has in fact raised this issue during the first meeting held at Chennai on January 28, after the establishment of a separate “Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board” G.O. No.114.The members said that it was great that the State had established a board and provided Rs.50 lakh for the year 2009–2010 to extend relief to the needy registered members of the board.All this is welcome but we need community certificates to get a sense of belongingness to our own caste identity, they alleged. Pudhirai Vannars remain as a caste that can be referred to as victims of ‘multiple marginalisation' who provide services to Dalits.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Pudhurai-Vannars-seek-community-certificates/article16298650.ece

  | Photo Credit: Bijoy Ghosh The Murugappa Group has set itself a turnover of target of over $7 billion to be hit by 2013-14. At present, the group has a turnover of $3.03 billion.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, A. Vellayan, Executive Chairman of the group, said each business unit of the group had worked out a strategy to grow at 24 per cent annually. With the country's GDP (gross domestic product) projected to grow at 8 per cent, Mr. Vellayan felt that the sales target was achievable. He said all the business units were looking to grow three times the GDP.The group's turnover for 2009-10 dropped by 14 per cent from Rs. 15,907 crore to Rs. 13,617 crore, mainly due to a sharp drop in the prices of key inputs for Coromandel International Ltd., the Executive Chairman said. Coromandel reported a 32 per cent decline in its turnover at Rs. 6,431 crore, the biggest sales drop among the group companies.Notwithstanding the setback on the turnover front, the Murugappa Group reported a 22 per cent jump in EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation) at Rs. 1,879 crore against Rs. 1,535 crore. The profit before tax (excluding extraordinary income) of the group grew by 29 per cent to Rs. 1,354 crore from Rs. 1,054 crore.Mr. Vellayan said that the group was able to ride the wave of economic rebound powered by enterprise-wide efficiency. EID Parry, he said, had increased its daily cane crushing capacity to 32,500 tonnes (along with 150 MW co-generation power and 230 kl alcohol) by acquiring Sadashiva Sugars in Karnataka and GMR Industries, which have plants in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The sugar refinery at Kakinada was expected to start operations this month, he added.Besides sugar, Mr. Vellayan indicated that fertilizers and engineering could be key growth areas for the group in the coming years. “With favourable growth outlook for auto and commercial vehicles sector, we see a growth potential of 20 per cent,” said N. Srinivasan, Director (Finance), Murugappa Group.Mr. Vellayan admitted that the group's foray into China was not a good experience. While the group closed its tube operations, it pulled out of the abrasive joint venture in China.On the challenges being faced on the HR front in the wake of entry of MNCs and big industrial houses from across the country into Tamil Nadu, he said “We have seven home grown CEOs heading the group companies. The management development centre conducts leadership and business development programmes.”",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/Murugappa-Group-profit-up-29-per-cent-at-Rs.-1350-crore/article16298863.ece

  | Photo Credit: Courtesy: DWS AUTO INDIA BMW is confident of retaining its numero uno position in the Indian luxury car market in 2010, which it achieved last year by overtaking its German rival Mercedes-Benz.“Last year we became India's top luxury car brand and we hope to retain this position and even grow further in the Indian market,” new BMW India President Andreas Schaaf told journalists here on Thursday.Dr. Schaaf, who has taken over from Peter Kronschnabl, said India was an exciting market full of opportunities. “There will be a lot of pressure (to retain the top position in India)… I take it as a challenge. Customer research has already shown that BMW is the strongest premium car brand and we hope to keep this customer confidence intact and grow even faster,” Dr. Schaaf added.Dr. Schaaf, who has completed his doctoral thesis and studied business administration at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, has come to head BMW's India operations after a successful stint as the Vice-President of BMW Group Korea with responsibility of sales and marketing. Before joining BMW Group Korea, he was the head of market development for the region Asia, Pacific, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe.On the other hand, Mr. Kronschnabl will be leading the German carmaker's Russia operations, where the company enjoys the leadership position. Since BMW India's inception in 2006, Mr. Kronschnabl not only built the BMW brand, setting up sales and service networks, but also took the Munich-headquartered company to the numero uno position. “I wish and hope that BMW India grows even faster… BMW is not just a brand, it's a philosophy,” he said in his farewell message.In 2009, BMW overtook Mercedes as the top luxury carmaker in the Indian market with sales of 3,619 units. Its market share in the luxury segment has crossed 40 per cent against just 9 per cent in 2006. With its recent launch of new 5 Series sedan in India, the luxury carmaker is upbeat on its sales.In 2010, the company has set even more ambitious target of achieving the sales of 4,000-units, besides expanding its network, taking the brand to Tier-II and Tier-III cities.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/BMW-India-hopes-to-retain-top-position/article16298864.ece

Consumer prices in India, particularly of food, have “remained stubbornly high”, it said while pointing to the Consumer Price Index (for industrial workers) which rose to nearly 9 per cent in 2008 and further to 12 per cent in 2009. “A faster increase in food prices has become a cause of concern,” it said.Turning to the South Asian economies, ESCAP expressed concern over the high deficits in some countries owing to the expansionary policies to counter the impact of the global financial crisis. “It is important that governments in the sub-region prepare a clear road map for fiscal consolidation to be implemented at the earliest to contain growing public debt…Yet another challenge is to manage portfolio capital inflows, mainly by FIIs that are leading to build-up of bubbles in capital markets and putting upward pressure on the exchange rates,” the report said.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ESCAP-projects-8.3-GDPgrowth-for-India-this-fiscal/article16298857.ece

  Now that the three-party alliance of Navin Ramgoolam has won 41 of the 60 seats in the Mauritius national Parliament — more than double the number of Paul Berenger's leftist Mouvement Militant Mauricien — there is general agreement that the 63-year-old former physician and lawyer has obtained a powerful mandate to implement economic and social reforms in his second consecutive term as this island-nation's Prime Minister.Some of those reforms eluded him during his first term; indeed, a few unpopular measures that Mr. Ramgoolam introduced — such as a national residential property tax, and another tax on interest from savings — spurred flight of capital in certain circles. The expectation is that such measures will be reviewed and possibly eliminated.The Prime Minister has also pledged a more aggressive “democratisation” of the economy — ensuring, among other things, that ownership of the vast sugarcane plantations that are currently controlled by the minority whites of French descent is also made accessible to other communities in this country of 1.3 million people dominated by Hindus. Creoles, Christians and Muslims also compromise larger sections of the demographic cohort than the Francos. A special “democratisation unit” has been formed in the Prime Minister's office, and its workload is certain to be amplified.Mr. Ramgoolam's election victory has also brought relief to several business supporters who had been targeted by Mr. Berenger and his financial backers. They had been apprehensive that the Berenger group would subvert, if not entirely destroy, their commerce.
Opposition claim
The 65-year-old Mr. Berenger, silver-haired and wearing an open-necked blue shirt, appeared at a gathering of followers early on Thursday evening and promised to continue “fighting the good fight”, and promised to work toward national unity. He was gracious about the Prime Minister's victory — a sentiment not necessarily appreciated by many in his audience — but asserted that the elections were neither free nor fair. Mr. Berenger chided the national television network for blatantly favouring the Prime Minister's alliance in order to ensure its victory.The Ramgoolam alliance's victory, however, will most definitely be welcomed by India, not the least because Mauritius contributes $12 billion in foreign direct investment to India, by far the biggest annual FDI from any country. Mr. Berenger — a former Prime Minister himself — while publicly proclaiming his fidelity to an “umbilical relationship” with India, has been known to privately express a desire for strengthened commercial and political relations with France and other Western powers.India's Chief Election Commissioner Navin Chawla has been here for the last several days at the invitation of the government. He was not an official observer, of course, but other Indian representatives in Mauritius must feel emboldened now to suggest stronger technical, educational and computer-science links between both countries. They are surely mindful of the disappointment of influential Mauritian business leaders that such ties were not deepened by India in the last few years.But they are also mindful that Mr. Ramgoolam enjoys a warm personal rapport with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. On Thursday, therefore, there were renewed expectations that Mr. Ramgoolam's new term could usher in an era characterised by enhanced bilateral economic and political relations.Those expectations took into account a public position by Mr. Ramgoolam that the Indian Ocean coral atoll of Diego Garcia — part of the Chagos Archipelago — would be turned over to Mauritius by the United States, which has maintained a large military base there since a 1971 secret agreement with the British Labour government of then Prime Minister Harold Wilson. That agreement called for Diego Garcia to be leased to the U.S.; the military base has been used by Washington for missile launches and naval operations against suspected terrorist havens in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and also parts of Africa.Some Indian critics have long felt that the American presence on Diego Garcia represented a form of political hegemony in the Indian Ocean, territory that ordinarily should be viewed as within India's sphere of influence.Mr. Ramgoolam has also suggested that Mauritius co-administer Tromelin Island, currently a French territory.
Concern for India
But one major issue of concern to India that may crop up during his new administration is that of China's growing economic presence in Mauritius, and its ambition to widen political influence throughout Africa. For example, China is building a new palm-frond-shaped airport here; it is also creating an industrial city from where goods will be re-exported to Africa and Europe.It is not that Mr. Ramgoolam is particularly wooing China, although its contribution to the local economy has been welcomed. It is India that has lagged in taking timely advantage of the economic opportunities available in a country of high literacy and aspirations to become a high-tech centre for the region.Such geopolitical considerations, of course, were not quite the stuff of the main conversations on Thursday in Mauritius as the election results poured in, and the winners celebrated at rallies while losers lamented without seeming to be grieving. Politics, after all, is not only about democracy, it is also about deportment.There was wide delight that Mr. Ramgoolam's second term would represent stability and continuity — his trusted lieutenant, Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun won from his constituency in the capital of Port Louis, in what had been a race made difficult and ugly by his opponent.It was also noted that, in addition to Paul Berenger's general political loss, the opposition front bench had been considerably weakened by the defeat of three of his closest aides. The craggy old leftist has now only his own shoulders to lean on, at least in Parliament. But who said politics was fair?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Mauritius-elections-hold-promise-for-India/article16298868.ece

  Auctioneers Christie's is facing a bitter compensation claim after a drawing it sold for £11,400 as a 19th-century German picture is claimed, actually, to be a 15th-century Leonardo da Vinci worth £100 million.The picture's original owner, Jeanne Marchig, who runs a U.K. foundation for animal welfare, is accusing the auction-house of negligence, alleging that it misattributed the drawing. She claims that, in failing to “exercise due care”, it sold the artwork for a “fraction” of its true value, according to a complaint filed in the Manhattan federal court.The drawing, a profile of a girl, is now on exhibition in Gothenberg, Sweden, as a Da Vinci. Ms Marchig is seeking unspecified damages, but court papers seen by the Guardian show her lawyer wants a substantial figure. They say the drawing is insured for more than $100 million and that its value exceeds $150 million.Ms Marchig was “devastated” when she discovered last July — in a call from Christie's — that the Da Vinci scholar Martin Kemp had hailed the portrait as La Bella Principessa, a depiction of Bianca Sforza, daughter of the Duke of Milan. The court papers assert that there is ample evidence that it is a Da Vinci. They mention a faint fingerprint, which matches that on a painting by Da Vinci, and carbon tests indicating dates from 1440 to 1650, not the 19th century. Christie's is accused of failure to use scientific methods and technology.But other experts are unconvinced of the attribution. Jacques Franck, the Da Vinci consultant at UCLA, told the Guardian on Wednesday: “It's not Leonardo's hand. The drawing presents anatomical mistakes, notably the link between the neck and the bust.” A Christie's spokesman said: “Christie's strongly disagrees with these claims and believes they are without merit.” — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Legal-battle-over-ldquoda-Vincirdquo/article16298867.ece
869,Kabul unveils plan to disarm militants,Jon Boone,2010-05-06,23:22:49 IST,"Afganistan President Hamid Karzai
  Top Taliban leaders could be offered exile outside Afghanistan if they agree to stop fighting the government of Hamid Karzai, a long-expected peace plan by the Afghan government will propose later this month.The far-reaching proposals, seen by the Guardian, also call for “deradicalisation” classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs created for foot soldiers who renounce violence.The long-delayed Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme has emerged just as Mr. Karzai prepares to go to Washington for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama, where the issue is likely to be top of the agenda.The plan will then be presented later in the month to a gathering of representatives from across Afghanistan called the National Consultative Peace Jirga. Once agreed upon, the government will be able to start spending around $160 million pledged by the international community to lure fighters away from the conflict. The document refers to such fighters as “angry brothers”, reflecting the belief that a substantial portion of insurgents are not motivated by strong ideological beliefs.Little is said in the report about the Taliban leaders managing the war against Mr. Karzai's government. However, it does say insurgent leaders could face “potential exile in a third country”.Saudi Arabia has been used in the past for such purposes, and there has been widespread speculation that exile could be offered to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hizb-e-Islami armed group, which in March sent a peace delegation to Kabul for talks with Mr. Karzai.Western powers are likely to be pleased by the level of detail about the new High Level Peace Council, which will take over from a notoriously chaotic predecessor body accused of reintegrating fighters who subsequently took up arms again.However, diplomats are worried that the government lacks the capacity to implement a programme that calls for complex activities in around 4,000 villages most affected by the insurgency. One diplomat said: “For the international community money is not a problem, they will pay whatever it takes. One gets a sense that there are people on the military side who will do most of the work and then give it some sort of an Afghan face.” The High Council and its executive body will be in charge of processing fighters who want to live peacefully. They will initially be put in “demobilisation centres” for a “cooling off” period of 90 days where their needs can be assessed and their personal security assured.If they agree to lay down their arms and cut ties with al Qaeda they will be entitled to an amnesty against prosecution for any crimes they may have committed. They will also be issued with a biometric “reintegration card”. They will then be offered a “menu” of options designed to keep them peacefully occupied, including vocational training in such trades as carpet-weaving and tailoring.There will also be the option to go through “deradicalisation” training, of the sort pioneered by Saudi Arabia. However, the report acknowledges the complexity of such programmes, the lack of “adequate experience” in Afghanistan and the likely need to send “highly radicalised” people to other countries for treatment.Major new institutions will also be set up to manage enormous job-creation schemes. An Engineering and Construction Corps will focus on labour-intensive work, such as the construction of Afghanistan's national highway system and other large-scale infrastructure projects. It also envisages teams of ex-Taliban fighters being rapidly deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and landslides. By far the most controversial option is the option for former insurgents to join the Afghan Army or police force. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Kabul-unveils-plan-to-disarm-militants/article16298866.ece
870,Lula and the Brazilian moment,Jorge Heine,2010-05-06,23:04:43 IST,"Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil. File Photo: AP
  T
ime magazine has just named President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the world's most influential leader. Barack Obama is ranked fourth. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is 19th (there are only four heads of state or government in the list). This is an exercise somewhat different from the traditional “Person of the Year” selection Time engages in each December, but highly revealing nonetheless. It is defined as “not about the influence of power, but about the power of influence.” Time has never selected a Latin American leader as person of the year. In India, Mahatma Gandhi made it in 1930.Brazil, once known as “the country of the future” that would always remain as such, has come a long way. That this should happen at the close of the eight-year presidency of the leader of the Brazilian Workers party (the PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores), whose very election prospects in 2002 led to a run on the real, the Brazilian currency, and BOVESPA, the Sao Paulo stock market, is striking.What is the secret of Lula and Brazil's success? How come a country best known until 20 years ago for its runaway inflation and rollercoaster economy has made it its present condition an investors' darling, that applies highly effective social policies, and that has positioned itself as a veto player in international affairs, one without whose acquiescence no major global initiative is viable?With a land mass of some 8.5 million square kilometres, the world's fifth largest, comparable to the continental United States, Brazil is more a continent than country. With a population of 190 million, and growing fast, it is not quite in the same league as China and India (which is why some people said there were “only two BRICs in the wall”), but is still the fifth most populated country. More than one out of three Latin Americans is Brazilian. With a GDP approaching $2 trillion, it is the eighth largest economy.Yet, Brazil's size has been immense ever since its independence in the 19th century, whereas its rise to the frontlines of international affairs has taken place only in the past 20 years. Why?The answer is simple: presidential leadership. Most would be hard-pressed to name a Brazilian president from the 1960s to the 1990s. For 20 years the country was run by obscure generals, and in 1985, with the return of democracy, by lacklustre civilians, who did little to combat the runaway inflation and the deep imbalances in one of the most unequal societies in the world.Lula has done a remarkable job, but he stands on the shoulders of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994-2002). It was as the improbable Minister for Finance of President Itamar Franco in 1993 that Cardoso, a sociologist, made his mark. He was the author of the Plan Real that brought inflation under control, and launched him all the way to Planalto, the presidential palace in Brasilia. Much like 1991 was a turnaround year in India, when under Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the country started to liberalise and open up its economy, 1993 was such a year in Brazil, and it has never looked back.Cardoso realised that Brazil needed not just to stabilise its currency but also to open up and deregulate its economy, stifled by decades of rampant protectionism. He privatised state enterprises, opened the doors for FDI and pushed business into export markets. Whereas in 1990 foreign trade reached 11 per cent of the GDP, it is now at 24 per cent. Whereas until 1990 Brazil attracted less than $1 billion a year in FDI, today it is, after China, the country in the developing world that attracts the most, reaching as much as $40 billion a year in recent times.By stabilising the polity and the economy (Brazil had four presidents from 1985 to 1994), Cardoso in his eight years did much to clear the underbrush for Lula. And despite all the criticism Lula had voiced from the opposition against Cardoso's alleged “neoliberal” policies, once he took office in January 2003, he realised that only orthodox economic policies would keep the ghost of inflation away. Lula appointed a conservative banker, Henrique Meirelles, head of the Central Bank, and briefed him to keep his eye on the inflation ball. As The Economist has pointed out, for a country whose average yearly inflation in the early 1990s reached 700 per cent, to have in 2006 a growth rate that was, for the first time, higher than the inflation rate was quite a feat.Lula, a former metal worker who lost one of his fingers on the factory floor, also came up with an imaginative social policy, the Bolsa de Familia. It transfers cash income to some 11 million families, who have to meet certain conditions (including school attendance of children, and monthly visits to government agencies), and has diminished Brazil's income inequality.As a man who cut his political teeth in the trade union movement, Lula knows all about “win-win” negotiations. He has also a remarkable ability to get along with everybody — from George W. Bush to Hugo Chávez. The PT is only one among many in the fragmented Brazilian party system (it controls only the governorships in three States out of Brazil's 27), and he leads a coalition government that includes right-wing parties, in Brazil's hard to manage “presidential coalitionism.” He has struck a delicate balance in which the private sector is the driving force of the economy, but the state plays a significant role through entities such as the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento (BNDES), which has a larger lending budget than the World Bank, and Petrobras, the state-owned oil company.In a country known for its populist, demagogic traditions, Lula embodies the modern leader who believes in institutions. In a region where many presidents want to perpetuate themselves in office, he rejected the possibility of changing the Constitution to allow him a third term. His own rags-to-riches trajectory and austere personal habits have meant that the corruption scandals that affected some of his staff never seriously dented his popularity, leading to the moniker of “teflon president”. His approval ratings have reached 80 per cent. He has been mentioned for a variety of top international jobs once he leaves office on 1 January 2011— from President of the World Bank to Secretary-General of the United Nations.Given that in foreign affairs also Lula has made a big impact, this is not surprising. With Celso Amorim as his Foreign Minister, he has capitalised on Brazil's “diplomatic GDP.”With an outstanding Foreign Ministry — known as “Itamaraty” for the 19th century palace in Rio de Janeiro that used to house it before the capital moved to Brazilia — Brazil has exercised its diplomacy with finesse and effectiveness. On the multilateral front, its ability to build coalitions, to give direction to the international agenda, and to take on key global governance issues has stood out. It has displayed it in the WTO and the U.N., as well as in the creation of (or inclusion in) myriad acronyms such as BRICs, BRICSAM, IBSA, the G20+, the G4, the O5, and, most notably, in the G20 at the leaders level (“the steering committee of the world economy”) launched in Washington in November 2008, and whose next meeting is being held in Toronto in late June. It has also put its money where its mouth is: at a time when many Foreign Ministries have cut budgets and closed embassies, Brazil, grasping that diplomacy has become more, and not less, significant in the age of globalisation, has done the opposite. From 2003 to 2008 it opened 32 embassies abroad, and now has 134.In Latin America also Brazil has played a key role. It has been the driving force behind new entities such as UNASUR, which has brought together all nations in South America, and the associated South American Defence Council, designed to provide an alternative to the by-now obsolete Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. It has taken the lead in stabilising Haiti through MINUSTAH, the first U.N. peacekeeping mission formed by a majority of Latin American troops and headed by a Brazilian general. It is willing to work with Washington, but not if that entails sacrificing principles such as democratic rule, as shown in last year's Honduran crisis.Instead of caving in to the so-called imperatives of globalisation, as so many other developing nations have done, Lula has led Brazil to assert its autonomy and independence, setting its own conditions for dealing with an international order in flux. His is the best example of the power of agency and initiative in foreign policy and diplomacy.

Of them, a total of 72,469 have been undergoing studies in various schools in the district and efforts were being made to enroll the balance 685 students who have stopped going to school or have not been admitted to schools.During the last year's census on children in the 11 to 14 years age group, a total of 55,702 students including 27,216 girls were enlisted. Of them 54,671 children have joined schools in the district while the SSA authorities were taking efforts to track down the rest 1,031 boys and girls and get them enrolled in schools, Dr. Uma Maheswari said. The stress would be on finding the reasons for the dropouts in particular cases and also ensuring that the children never enrolled were admitted in the nearby schools to pursue their education. While the officials were doing their bit, the role of the parents and the elders in the family need to be stressed, the Collector said.

The achievement of Anbakam Metals was illustrated in Home News Tribune and Sentinel.The award stresses the importance of exports in the national economy and illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities, the Sentinel reported. “Anbakam's niche markets have been focussed on the Indian subcontinent region and the Far East. The firm has helped to create a demand for containerized shipments of metal scrap while supplying jobs amid a gloomy job market.It has used the Department of Commerce's Gold Key Program to create business opportunities and sales in the Vietnam market,” the report said.While working as a business software developer for JP Morgan Chase Mr. Sivakumar started the company by customising containers for easy loading of scrap metal for export from trucks to ships at the Northeast region of United States.The company moved 10,000 tonnes of scrap metal to overseas market last year using the small volumes approach that had been vogue for years in California and Florida.Exports by the company accounted for one per cent of the 14 million tonnes of ferrous exports from the US in 2009, according to the report published by Home News Tribune. A press release issued by the company's Liaison Office, Tiruchi, said that the award designed by the US Government to recognise export businesses illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities and companies which have successfully entered into international markets and had great success with the help of US Government agencies.Anbakam Metals is now looking to extend its services to newer, untouched markets, the release said.Mr. Sivakumar, who started his career as a 22-year-old with Pershing Corp, which specialised in business intelligence technology, and subsequently worked for BMW and JP Morgan, before venturing into the metal scrap business, said of Anbakam's future plans: “In next three to six months, we will be breaking ground for a power plant in South India and also venturing into renewable energy sector in the USA. By providing countries with these raw materials and our services, we become an essential part to the infrastructural growth in these markets.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/USA-honours-Tiruvarur-emigrant-with-award/article16298621.ece

We have absolute confidence in these players,” Loew said.There was, as expected, no place for midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger who has moved to Italian side Lazio after losing his place in the VfB Stuttgart side.Eight players were part of the 2006 World Cup team that had clinched third place: Ballack, Lahm, Klose, Schweinsteiger, Per Mertesacker, Arne Friedrich (Hertha Berlin), Marcell Jansen (Hamburger) and Lukas Podolski (Cologne).Loew said the preparations for the World Cup had never been more difficult or complicated because of the many leading players who will be joining training camps later in view of their club commitments.Ballack, who is appearing with Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and the Bayern and Bremen players, who are in the German Cup final a week on Saturday, will miss a friendly against Malta a day earlier.The Bayern players won’t be able to join up with the rest of the squad until after the May 22 Champions League final against Inter Milan in Madrid.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Seven-Bayern-players-in-Germany-WC-squad/article16298812.ece
878,Tottenham secures Champions League spot,DPA,2010-05-06,15:39:05 IST,"Tottenham Hotspur will be playing Champions League football next season after they beat Manchester City 1-0 Wednesday in the English Premier League.Peter Crouch headed the only goal of the game eight minutes from time as Spurs clinched the points they needed to join Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal in next season’s Champions League.The victory lifted Spurs to 70 points, four better than City with just one match apiece remaining, and the London side will now play a qualifying match to get into the group stages of the Champions League.It is the first time since 1962 that Tottenham will have played in what was then called the European Cup, and manager Harry Redknapp said he had taken a punt with an attacking team selection.“It was great to come here and win,” Redknapp said. “I took a big gamble tonight and played an attacking team. We went for it.“People will think I’m mad coming away from home like this — all the top teams only play with one up front now. I’m very pleased — it’s great for the club, a good achievement, and we have played great football this year.” Spurs were bottom of the table when Redknapp took over in October 2008 but quickly turned them around.“Of course this means a lot to me,” he said. “I’m delighted, but I know I’m good at my job. I wouldn’t have done it if I was a mug.” Tottenham were the better side throughout, and Ledley King had the ball in the net in the first half, but his goal was ruled out for a foul.Adam Johnson tested Huerelho Gomes in the Tottenham goal, and the goalkeeper stopped a deflection from his own defender, Gareth Bale, before Kolo Toure headed straight at Gomes.Jermain Defoe forced a good save from Martin Fulop, and for a long time it looked as if it would be a draw.But with eight minutes to go, Younes Kaboul sent in a cross that took a deflection, and Fulop palmed the ball straight at Crouch, who headed the ball over the line.“I’m just very happy to finish fourth. That’s where we wanted to be,” Redknapp said. “It was important someone got in from outside the big four, I could only see Man City breaking in.“I thought it was going to be really tough — I could only see us finishing in the top seven and getting a European place. That says an awful lot for us.” In the night’s other match, Stoke City won 1-0 at Fulham thanks to a late strike from Matthew Etherington, whose goal lifted Stoke into the top half of the table.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Tottenham-secures-Champions-League-spot/article16298730.ece

  Cristiano Ronaldo rescued Real Madrid again, scoring an astonishing hat-trick in a 4-1 comeback at fifth-place Mallorca.Their fifth consecutive win keeps Real just one point behind leaders Barcelona.The twin giants have smashed the all-time Spanish points record: Barca have 93 points, Real have 92.“It was a great night for us,” said Ronaldo, “the merit corresponds to the entire team, not just to me. We just have to carry on winning and hope that Barca drop points in Sevilla.”Barca are at fourth-place Sevilla on Saturday before finishing on May 15 at home to lowly Valladolid. Real are at home Saturday to Athletic Bilbao before finish at troubled Malaga.Aritz Aduriz headed Mallorca into the lead in the 16th minute, after the Real defence had failed to clear a corner. But 10 minutes later Ronaldo made it 1-1 by getting on the end of a diagonal ball from Sergio Ramos and beating keeper Dudu Aouate with a high lob.His Real counterpart, Iker Casillas, had to pull off three sharp saves in the first half with Mallorca breaking through at will.The whites took control after the interval and pulled apart a slow Mallorca defence.In the 58th minute, Ronaldo made it 2-1 after taking another cross from Sergio Ramos on his chest and scoring with a toe-poke.The Portuguese megastar completed his hat-trick 15 minutes later with the best goal of the night. He received the ball on the left, powered past four defenders and made it 3-1 with a precise, low drive.Gonzalo Higuain made it 4-1 with an audacious lob as Mallorca lost heart and spirit.Higuain has scored 26 league goals, one more than Ronaldo, but five less than Barca’s Lionel Messi.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Ronaldo-hat-trick-gives-Real-Madrid-vital-win/article16298729.ece
880,She's got the whole world on a string,Ranjani Govind,2010-05-06,15:26:00 IST,"Jayanthi Kumaresh
  A young veena performer from the Lalgudi family, immersed in a concert by veena S. Balachander and her aunt-guru Padmavathi Ananthagopalan, was called on stage by the maestro himself to take part. She impressed enough for him to announce that the young talent would henceforth flourish in his school. If that was a day Jayanthi Kumaresh cherishes, it is no wonder that her performances today, resonant with Balachander's style, are stamped with remarkable intellectual value.Even the recent Kumaresh-Jayanthi ‘violin-veena melodic-samvaada' at the Chamarajpet Ramseva Mandali was steeped in classicism with nary a hint of dumbing down.Although Lalgudi Rajalakshmi's gifted daughter continued her tutelage under Balachander till his death in 1990, she makes it a point to underscore the strong foundation and strict schooling she received from her aunt Padmavathi.“It wasn't just the classes, the disciplinarian that she was had me work in clockwork precision through the day. After school, her timetable had me take up yoga, typing, French classes, dance, music lessons and creative pursuits of writing and poetry.”Jayanthi, who has a Masters in English Literature, says “every pursuit will come in handy for decades”.Consider the sumptuousness of her approach, which, from the gayaki styling went on to grasp the highly individualistic creativity of Balachander's genius.“Every raga has to be discovered beyond its clichéd phrases,” she says. “Balachander was fond of raga expositions more than format-kritis, as lyrics and language, he believed, were beyond the realms of an instrument.”Jayanthi too is self-made, as her approach over the years of melodic discovery is fashioned in a way that “people understand the divine characteristics of the instrument too”. Novelty in her exercises are also to be commended, for, nothing strays beyond the classical contours. It is here that her husband Kumaresh explains her CD Thillana-Thillana that has some bracing exclusivity.Jayanthi enjoys her role in Shastriya Syndicate Presentations (a Hindustani and Carnatic collaboration) just as she sounds animated to spearhead her fusion band, Indian Spice, that has piquant raga-based presentations with vocals, drums, Latin percussion, keyboard, tabla, violin and, of course, the veena.",https://www.thehindu.com/arts/Shes-got-the-whole-world-on-a-string/article16299553.ece
881,Life on the edge,jigar shah,2010-05-06,14:39:35 IST,"Abhishek Bachchan in 'Raavan'.
  
Abhishek Bachchan must be a happy man — not everyone gets to work for Mani Ratnam thrice! His third film with the celebrated director, Raavan is slated to hit the marquees soon. The actor narrates the unforgettable experience the film was, and why his role is the most fun he's played yet. Excerpts.


We see you jumping off a cliff, in the Raavan promo. Did it yourself?

Yeah. It was in Hogenakkal, and it was 90-foot high. Mani said: ‘I can't let my lead actor jump; the river current is strong, and there's rock below the water'. The insurance guys agreed (laughs). But, I insisted I'd do it myself, for we had a diver along, to teach me. A five-year-old boy jumped next to us, those were kids who do it for money. So, I told Mani: ‘If he can do it, so can I.'

What was going on in your mind when you jumped?

The jump takes so long that you actually have the time to think ‘Oh God, I am going to die'… but, it was fun. I did it just once. In fact, I've not done a more physically and emotionally challenging film in my career. Shooting drains you, but you feel nice when you return home; you feel you've achieved something.

Could you connect to the mythological Raavan while playing this character?

Look, the film is not like any other film. However, it has glimpses of mythology, just like any other film. When I told Mani people will draw comparisons, he asked me to name one film that wasn't influenced by mythology. And, I couldn't! But, Raavan is a modern film. It is not inspired by any other character or contemporary leader. He is just a character Mani came up with.

But your character Beera is spoken of as having 10 heads… just like Raavan.

The ten heads refer to ten personalities — there are ten different facets that are easily referred to as dus sar. Incidentally, Beera's pet name in the film is Raavan. Beera is like an animal — he is wild and unpredictable. He's the most fun guy I've ever played. We actors make character sketches so we can follow them in deciding what a character would and wouldn't do. For example, there are certain things Gurukant Desai (Guru) could do and couldn't. But, Beera will be laughing one minute, and the next, there'll be anger on his face. The fun thing about Beera is there's nothing he won't do; he can get away with anything.

How was it to work with Mani Ratnam for the third time — after Yuva and Guru?

You are in awe of him because of what he brings to the table, but the moment he says cut, he becomes this close friend. His favourite line is ‘Keep it real, make it real'. While you are standing in five feet of freezing water, with snakes swimming around and leeches sticking to you, Mani says: ‘Do anything, but make it a convincing performance'. If you are standing under the waterfall or on a hostile terrain, you'll find Mani leading from the front, standing in waist-deep water himself. If he can do it, who are you to not?

Were you scared for Aishwarya that she too had to do stunts, as in the song ‘Behne de'?

You know what? Half-way through rough terrains, she was the one guiding me as to where to place my feet. In fact, she's the film's hero; Dev and Beera are the heroines. She was helping Kenny (actor Vikram) sir too. Kenny and I'd watch her stunts wondering: ‘kaise karti hai re? (hey, how does she do it?)'. Not just stunts, she picks up everything in a jiffy — think dance steps. So much so that after our three- or four-day dance rehearsals, our performance is judged against hers!

How is it to act with your wife?

It's great to work with one of the finest actors and one of the most dedicated professionals in the country. But, the best part is, the moment Mani announces ‘pack up', I'm with my wife!

882,A method in madness,SHELLEY WALIA,2010-05-06,19:14:59 IST,"Jonathan Littell's novel The Kindly Ones is a translation of the French version published in 2006. Ever since its publication, it has achieved a monumental status both in France and the rest of the world with its grim World War II plot. It concerns the life of Maximilien Aue who unemotionally participates in the Nazi atrocities, and has been at Auschwitz and at Berlin during the Allied attacks. As Littell aptly puts it, his hero is a ‘roving X-Ray, a scanner', more of a machine than human to whom the landscape is as important as the gas chambers.The novel is largely a reworking of the Orestia myth where after killing his mother Clytemnestra, Orestes is hounded by the Furies. At the end of the Greek play, the Furies are appeased and metamorphose into Eumenides which literally means ‘the oindly ones'. Orestes goes free and unpunished just as Aue, who, on the one hand, is an obedient slave of the genocide machinery, and on the other, becomes a reliable and an objective narrator of the Nazi crime, claiming that genocide paradoxically has behind it the impetus of “calm, collected'' ordinary people. Though addressed to his ‘human brothers' the book seeks answers to the reason why such heartless cruelty exists in the world. As Aue maintains: ‘Now of course the war is over. And we've learned our lesson, it won't happen again. But are you quite sure we've learned our lesson? Are you certain it won't happen again?' He goes on to argue: ‘There are psychopaths everywhere, all the time. Our quiet suburbs are crawling with pedophiles and maniacs, our homeless shelters are packed with raving megalomaniacs …and then the very same State that would without batting an eye send them to war crushes them like a blood-swollen mosquito. These sick men are nothing. But the ordinary men that make up the State— especially in unstable times — now there's the real danger. The real danger for mankind is me, is you.'
Contrasts
Guilty of murder and matricide, he remains happily oblivious of his role, busy as he is in the concluding years of his life employed as a Director in a lace factory. Loss of memory of his past is interestingly in contrast with his clear memory of the Nazi madness and the horror of those years of destruction. He is located inside the story of Germany and yet becomes the clear headed analyst from the vantage point of an outsider. Aue's account of Germany war history takes up much of the book. On the other hand the story of his private life as a homosexual incestuously craving for anal sex with his twin sister never reaches any conclusive end.Finally, the book leaves the reader with an open-ended world of questions to a phenomenon that has intrigued the world for decades: why did the very responsible and often learned Nazi supporters back such a terrible programme of extermination. Certainly, not because of the anti-Semitic ideology, nor a personal grouse against the Jews. Justice and responsibility are after all not all that unambiguously simple concepts to deal with. The theme of dichotomy of passion and indifference draws the reader simultaneously to understand the crime and to condemn it.In doing his work, the war criminal does not hate the people he executes, nor is he taking revenge on them or killing them because they are a threat to him. As in the case of Aue, there is no revulsion, shame or guilt. Nevertheless he compares the American soldier in Vietnam with the Nazis: “he is ‘just like you,' and people like you are capable of carrying out even the most horrific acts when the circumstances demand it. If you are an American, consider your little Vietnam adventure, which so traumatized your fellow citizens. You lost fifty thousand troops there in ten years… I obviously am not including the Vietnamese dead; since you never speak of them, in your books or TV programs.… In a total war there can be no civilians, only the fight of one mass against another. In such a fight every participant is equally guilty: the killers with blood on their hands and the supply officers who fuel the trucks. You might have died rather than shoot, but would you have died rather than pump gasoline?”The story derives its significance from the complex notions of justice, guilt and responsibility and takes us back to the controversy over Hannah Arendt's article “Eichmann in Jerusalem” (1963) on Adolf Eichmann's trial. The book becomes intellectually challenging when seen in terms of the sense of duty when the crime begins to take on another shade of the responsibility of action. Within the ambit of one's duty lies the question of behaviour according to the demands of the job in hand even if it means death for some. This is the central paradox of any discussion on the philosophical issue of ethics and duty.
Going beyond
Aue's involvement, like Eichmann's, in sending hundreds of Jews to the gas chambers does not give him any pangs of conscience, but is the result of a deep-seated desire to fulfill the demands of an assignment. Personal feelings or the sense of morality are not permitted to interfere with the sense of duty.To Arendt, it was more a case of thoughtlessness, than a ‘monstrosity', an incapacity to ‘think from the point of view of others.' And Littell elaborates on this idea through a fictional work that is at once history as an eyewitness account as well as a critique of passive acceptance of a role that the state imposes on individuals who headlong turn into cogs in the wheels of the state apparatus.On the human level the choices we make determine our destiny and define our ideological stance. Rules are too conventional and narrow in scope to cover the paradoxes and ironies of our existence.

883,A longing for ease,SOFIA GHORI SALEEM,2010-05-06,19:13:02 IST,"Another Gulmohar Tree written by Aamer Hussein, is a story two people from across the continents who build a life together of quest, commitment and ultimate reward. Lydia is an English woman who meets Usman, a Pakistani writer 10 years her senior, at a socialist seminar in Bloomsbury. She decides to follow Usman back to Pakistan and eventually marries him and settles down in Karachi. The story tells about Lydia's many, seemingly easy adjustments, and adaptations to her new life and culture. Usman, on the other hand, appears to struggle with his life, his career and his family.The book describes the couple to be “Puzzled angels, visiting earth on holiday, lost until you finally find each other.” Lydia certainly comes through as an angel who forsakes her career, her language, culture, religion and country for the sake of her love for a foreign man. She is portrayed as a woman who hits the ground running and changes her name, religion, dress and even learns Urdu, all this before meeting her man again or being certain of a marriage proposal by him.One wonders whether this is the kind of confluence of east and west, people of cross cultural experience desire – a lasting commitment from a western woman whose transformation, acceptance and level of comfort with the eastern culture is so total – its a bit unbelievable. Is this realistic to expect? Can it sustain over long periods of time?Rokeya's (as Lydia now calls herself) experiences with her new culture are not elaborated upon. Her frustrations and learning experiences are foreign to the reader. Rokeya never pines for her native home or her family – except for shedding a tear when her father sends a birthday card late.Her remarkable integration is more seamless that most expatriates returning to their homeland. The book also raises the question: what is the inherent value of someone willing to change so much and demand so little. It's interesting that this book talks about the ease of adjustment when immigrating back to Pakistan just as his previous book Insomnia dwells on some of its difficulties.
Insomnia and Other Stories is a collection of short stories set in no particular place or chronological order. The main protagonist in many of the stories is a Pakistani named Murad. Many of the stories trace the life story of Murad from a young, awkward, impressionable student to a mature writer in his middle age. Hussein writes much about writers themselves in the stories “The Book of Maryam”, the “Angelic Disposition”, “Insomnia” , and “Hibiscus Days”.Hussein returns to certain central themes over and over again in his writings – the flaming Gulmohar tree, the blood red Hibiscus bush.He writes about the right to dream and the choice to serve – about disillusionment and untimely death. He examines friendships and discontinuity and the lonely life of writing. His preoccupation with writing is evident in his recurrent return to this theme.Seclusion seems to be the lot of his writers – sometimes chosen, sometimes accidental, as well as longing and a sense of not belonging. Of living in the fabric of a society and yet pulling back. These are stories about people who share the same intellectual and emotional space and inspire each other to write. Friends that form a network, or a safety blanket if you will, to nurture, coax and egg one on towards goals. All of his writer subjects are middle aged and single or divorced or childless as stated in one of the stories.The “Book of Maryam” quotes from the Quran – the story of the birth of Jesus.In “The Angelic Disposition”, the protagonist takes comfort in the strength of her husband's unquestioning support to grieve for a man who was never more than a friend. She counts on her rosary (tasbeeh) 33 times, then 33 times, then 33 times again, not the names of her Lord, but the words of her friend. The story makes reference to the Christian belief of Satan being a fallen angel – and that angels should never grow old.“Insomnia” is about melancholy, grief and soul searching, death and devastation, where the silence stretches on waiting for the phone to ring for the next encounter with a friend.Aamer Hussein's stories live in the cutting edge of loneliness, pain and a heightened need to communicate every shiny raindrop, every pearly teardrop, every flaming bush and singing thrush.They make you think - about cultural boundaries, about the passage from youth to middle age, about being a foreigner in a different land. About Wars, earthquakes, tsunamis – naturals disasters, death and darkness. About the fallibility of relationships. About feelings and futility.And they remind you of the poem “Spring and Fall – to a Young Child” byGerard Manley Hopkins : Margaret, are you grieving Over Goldengrove unleaving?

884,In the dying light,K. SRILATA,2010-05-06,19:12:02 IST,"“ I have now set out to do the things / you loved most about me./About a gift called poetry… I have set about writing, / what you perhaps would most love me to do - / write about you,” says Gopikrishnan Kottoor. “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” (a sequence of poems that forms part of the larger collection Victoria Terminus) is a tribute to the poet's dying father.That Kottoor should have given himself the permission to write these poems about his father as the latter lay in coma following a brain hemorrhage may be hard for some to understand. But then the poet tells us in no uncertain terms that this is just what his father would have wanted him to do, that, in fact, his father is more than just his muse-of-the-moment. In “saving” the poet's poems on his shelf “as though poems were pigeons/and needed a home,” the older man has nurtured his son's work, offering “a carving of [his] bone/to hone [his] poems upon”.It is at once easy and unimaginably hard to work with subjects so intensely personal, hard to write of events that unfold even as you write. That these poems travel so well is a tribute to Kottoor's abilities as a poet. Images of Christ's crucifixion intertwine with the journey into the ICU of the poet's father: “I remember you laughing your way into the ICU /Like Christ never did upon the cobbled stones.” Oddly touching even if sometimes over the top, the poems in “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” succeed in holding you. There is a sensuous quality to Kottoor's work best exemplified perhaps by the poem “The Man in the Mist”: “Someday these tears will end ./ What began as a wild desire, a wetness under the forest leaves , /turns cold, the sun takes on the words/spoken by the lips of rain, / the fragrances of bright hidden flowers/mating in the open air.” The images are fragile, evocative. One wonders though why Kottoor (with just a few exceptions) avoids the Malayalam kinship terms for father and mother.The second section - “Mother Sonata” – is also meant to be read as a sequence of poems. The poems here are reflections on pain, death and dying and, in this case, it is the poet's mother to whom the poems pay tribute. There are some weak poems in this section. Excessively sentimental and flowery, “Fairy Child” is particularly disappointing: “You were so good to lay my fairy child-head on / When I put my arms around you / you cradled me with misted clouds ,/ as upon lost mountain blues” may pass muster if written by an amateur poet. This inconsistency is somewhat puzzling.“Painted Wagons Rolling”, which forms the third section of the anthology, contains some of Kottoor's best poems. The “millipedes curling up” that emerge in the poem “Digging” testify to the “worship” that “mud-work” is. These mostly invisible creatures of the soil do their “odd jobs” in much the same way, presumably, that a poet does his.For a poet too digs – in his case, for meaning that would otherwise lie buried. The poems in this section boast of a range that is understandably lacking in the earlier two sections, containing reflections on dead poets and what survives their death to sharply satirical portraits triggered by an old boy's reunion.The last section “Victoria Terminus”, planned as another sequence, takes us on board Mumbai's local trains. We look out of the window to see old men defecating, while inside the compartment we meet card players intent on their game despite the fact of there being “not enough floor/to even straighten toes.” We also encounter deaths and bomb blasts - all the stories, big and small, that make up the Mumbai local. While one appreciates the spirit behind these Mumbai local vignettes, one can't help wishing that Kottoor had been more careful in his crafting and diction. Poems like “The Eunuchs” and “Drinking Water” remain on the surface, lacking the subtlety, the layers that emerge in “Digging” and “The Man in the Mist”.

885,‘I’ve always been a writer’,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,19:11:03 IST,"RAHULMEHTA: Coming out.
  | Photo Credit: g mail Rahul Mehta’s short-story collection Quarantine is about young gay men and their relationships with their families and lovers. Written with unusual tenderness and insight, the book represents a coming out of sorts for Mehta, a U.S.-based lecturer whose relatives in India don’t yet know that he is homosexual.
When did you first develop an interest in writing, and specifically creative writing?
I’ve always been a writer. Even when I was 13 or 14, I was telling people that I was going to be a writer. In ninth grade once, we had to do a research project on a career that we were interested in. When we had to submit our proposals for our projects, I chose “writer”, and my teacher wrote back, “That’s not a career. Choose something else.” So I shadowed an advertising executive.To be fair to my teacher, I don’t think she was necessarily trying to discourage me. I think she was just trying to get me to be practical, to save me from a difficult path. Much later, in grad school, one of my professors said a similar thing. She said she always tells her students who want to become writers, “If you can do something else, do it. If you can’t: God help you, and welcome.”
At risk of sounding reductive, was there a connection between your initial realisation that you were gay and your taking up writing? Did writing help you come to terms with your sexuality?
I do think that there is a connection. Being gay forced me early on to question one of the most fundamental aspects of who I am. Naturally, that sense of inquiry extended to other areas as well. I think it led me to ask bigger questions about everything around me. I once had this boss who, ticking items off on her fingers, said, “Gay, Indian, raised in West Virginia…of course you ended up a writer.” I think what she meant was that it was only natural for me to turn to writing as a way to try to make sense of these various experiences and these various selves.
Were these stories written to announce your sexual identity in a public space? Or was the sexual orientation of the characters incidental to the whole?
My intent, always, first and foremost, is to tell a compelling story. Sure, I’m drawn to certain types of narratives and characters, but I never set out writing a story with a specific purpose other than to craft a compelling narrative. In fact, I rarely even know what a story is going to be about when I sit down to write it. The seed for a story is usually a first line that I find interesting in some way; that has some tension, perhaps in the sounds of the words or in the relationship between characters. Then I let whatever tension is inherent in that sentence lead me to what should come next. At least with first drafts, I’m very much a sentence-to-sentence writer.A writer I admire named Gary Lutz once described a similar process. He said when writing a sentence he generally puts down a word and then he tries to figure out what word that first word yearns for. That’s the word he used: “yearns.” I love that.
This is a work about marginalised people in general, not just gay people: your depictions of lonely, elderly people are very empathetic. Are you particularly interested in themes like isolation and personal dislocation?
Yes, absolutely. I do think those are themes and characters I’m particularly drawn to. Perhaps it comes from my growing up feeling so much like an outsider — brown-skinned in a small West Virginian town that was overwhelmingly white — and witnessing so many of my relatives and Indian family friends who seemed, in some way or another, to be outside as well. I grew up with my father’s parents living in our house. I often wondered what it might have felt like to them to land in this tiny southern American town after five decades of living in Mumbai.
There is a bit of sex in the book, but nothing that’s very explicit. Was that a conscious decision?
Several people have made this comment to me, that there isn’t much sex in the book and that what’s there is tasteful. I’m glad to hear it. What it says to me is that the sex doesn’t jump out or distract or hijack the narratives which, as we’ve discussed, aren’t really about sexuality at all. I think my mom would disagree with you, though. Just yesterday she was complaining to me, “Why so much sex?” But maybe, being my mother, she reads it differently than the typical reader. At any rate, I didn’t make a conscious decision one way or another about how much sex to include in the book. But I do think it’s really tough to write about sex.
The tone of the stories “The Cure” and “What We Mean” is more wry and playful than the others, though they are both very poignant in their own ways. Were you trying to be more experimental when you wrote them?
Yes, I do think both those stories have a somewhat different feel – they are much more language-driven than plot-driven. They are of a piece with a slew of shorter works (two to four pages long) that my editor and I eventually decided to cut from the collection because they seemed too different in tone and style than the other stories. Writing these pieces, I was very much influenced by writers like Lutz, whom I mentioned earlier, as well as Lydia Davis, Christine Schutt, Diane Williams and Amy Hempel — writers whose sentences have a sculptural quality and a close attention to sound.
What is your overall impression of attitudes towards homosexuality in India? The Supreme Court judgement legalising homosexuality last year was a welcome step, but it also caused paranoia in conservative circles. Then there was the recent case of a professor who committed suicide after being secretly videotaped having sex with another man.
I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Dr. Siras, and I was shocked by the vicious harassment he endured from the students. Does this event, and the paranoia and uproar you referred to, reflect widespread attitudes toward LGBT people in India? I’m not sure. But what I do know is that I’ve travelled all over India with my partner, Robert, and we’ve rarely felt comfortable being truly open about our relationship. At the same time, Robert and I feel the same discomfort in non-urban areas of the U.S. as well. If we are travelling in America, we will never check into a motel in a small town and ask for a single, king-sized bed. We always take the room with two double beds without making a fuss about it.
Have many of your relatives in India read the book?
I’ve been a total coward when it comes to talking to my relatives in India about the book or about my sexual orientation. I still haven’t told them about either. If they’ve seen the book or seen any of the press, they haven’t mentioned it to me. Honestly, I don’t know how they will react. I guess I’ll find out when I come to India next month. But I have faith in them. I know that they love me, and in the end I do think that that trumps everything. Whatever political and social hang-ups people may have, if they love you, they find a way to understand. I’ve seen this again and again with people in my life. And of course, this extends far beyond sexual orientation. Family members who truly love one another accept each other for who they are, whatever that might be.
Do you read much Indian writing in English? Is there anyone whose work you’re especially impressed by?
Arundhati Roy is basically a minor deity in my eyes. The God of Small Things is one of my all-time favourite novels, and her non-fiction writings and her social and political activism are tremendous inspirations to me. Her work is swelling with generosity and kindness. There are so many works by Indian writers from which I’ve taken inspiration — Vikram Seth’s Golden Gate, Amitav Ghosh’s Shadow Lines, and Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children come to mind. More recently I’ve loved Pankaj Mishra’s The Romantics, Githa Hariharan’s In Times of Siege, and the Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist (which I teach in one of my classes). As for poetry, I love Arun Kolatkar’s Jejuri as well as anything by Agha Shahid Ali.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/lsquoIrsquove-always-been-a-writerrsquo/article16298815.ece

  The bookstore boom in Bangalore has meant the arrival of big corporate chains which offer a lot beside books. But these have in no way dimmed the charm of the much-loved antiquarian book store of Bangalore, The Select Bookshop started way back in 1945. If anything, the old world store off Brigade Road seems more precious than ever before, no less than a landmark of the city.
A wide variety
The store is crammed with unusual and rare second-hand books on a variety of topics ranging from Oriental literature to architecture and gardening. What makes the store extra special is its amiable owner, K.K.S. Murthy, who knows every book, and more often than not, will tell you an interesting story or two on how he came to acquire it.The shop was started by Murthy's bibliophile father K.B.K. Rao, who turned his love for collecting books into a business enterprise. He often travelled from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh to Bangalore to pick out rare books at auctions and eventually started Select here. Mr. Murthy, who was working as an aeronautical engineer in the United States, followed his father's footsteps into the book trade in the 1970s.Even as he worked in New Jersey, Mr. Murthy's weekends were dedicated to scouting for precious books for his father back home. He can vividly recall chancing upon some “extraordinary rejects” in the backyard of Barnes and Noble, such as a rare collection of Carl Jung's writings.Over the years Select has retains its dedicated clientele and new people keep walking in, having heard of this quaint place by word of mouth. The shop has had its share of illustrious customers, including C.V. Raman, Philip Spratt, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar and Ruskin Bond.Select now also has its own imprint, which has brought out some valuable books such as a reprint of Ananda Coomaraswamy's Time and Eternity. The first floor of the shop is an art gallery.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Still-going-strong/article16298814.ece

  While dedicated antique bookshops are rare, digging around old bookstores, one can come across some gems. Paramount Book Store on Janpath, New Delhi, is one such store. Ask owner Naresh Kambiri about antique books and he produces a fragile International Library of Famous Literature carefully wrapped in a dusty plastic bag. One of 20, the book had been edited by Dr. Richard Garnett of the British Museum and was published in 1900. Rare books by Kashmiri Sufi saint Lalla Rukh are available too. But there isn't much of a demand. “We've only been getting enquiries, that too mostly from foreigners,” says Kambiri.The Oxford Bookstore has a section on antique and rare books. These include first editions, limited editions, rare publications and out-of-print books. It is interesting to see tomes like Voyages and Travels: India, Ceylon, The Red Sea, Abyssinia and Egypt (first printed in 1811), A New Account of the East Indies: 1688 to 1723 (first printed in 1739), India and its Native Princes: Travels in Central India and in the Presidencies of Bombay and Bengal by Louis Rousselet (1875) and A History of the Indian Mutiny by G.W.

888,A bunch of blooms,SHREEKUMAR VARMA,2010-05-06,19:05:40 IST,"It is one thing to gather a bouquet, and quite another to conjure up a bunch of surprisingly different blooms, that satisfies because of its variety and freshness. Penguin's First Proof 5is a gathering of personal voices that explore moods and relationships, challenges and statistics through fiction, nonfiction and a pinch of verse.
Stunning start
It begins with the stunning story of Ruma, prostitute by day, housewife by night, an activist who yet surrenders to the pressures of husband and family. Bishakha Datta's straightforward prose brings alive the paradox in the life of a woman whose sacrifices may never be recognised by society as we have it today. Samanth Subramaniam's “Hunting the Sailfish” culls tense drama through minimalist narrative, reportage that simmers beneath the surface. Hemingway's ghost looms over us because of the subject, philosophy and sparseness of expression.What follows in the nonfiction section is a quick-fire portrait of jungle-king Veerappan, his interactions with people he's kidnapped. And an interesting sketch of Kutch with its paling borders of landscape, language and people, followed by a very objective study by three women of women who want to have “fun”, the problems they face while occupying space without “purpose”. Editor-in-chief of The New Indian ExpressAditya Sinha's brutally frank forays into family history and latent homosexuality can only result in his being forever persona non grata with a clutch of rankled relatives. Vamsee Juluri's study of non-violence and “Munnabhai” examines the proffered meaning of Gandhi's heritage and its scope, concluding that cinema is still its one faithful follower. Satnam's sojourn in the Bastar jungle is next, along with communist guerrillas, an account of the routine life of militants, with mild, off-the-cuff observations: “A fortress-like structure had been erected with tree branches and bamboo, where the guerrillas practise destroying such fortifications”.And so to fiction.The first offering is K.R. Meera's “Ave Maria”, a brutal glimpse into the debris of Kerala's Communist ideology, the fault lines left behind in families. “The Imaginary Friend” tells of a man and his little cousin, a train journey that shows how the mind can make or break. “The Brass Tumbler” follows the tradition of classic Hindi fiction, the story of an heirloom whose history mirrors (or causes) a family's upheavals.
Exquisite stories
The two stories that follow are gems. Completely different in tone and setting, they scream out the need for love and freedom, of belonging and recognition, women's outpourings that yearn for choices within the patriarchal claustrophobia. Bakul Mukhtiar's tale of an extra-marital relationship is sparse and evocative, like the room where the liaisons take place. And Swarnalatha Rangarajan's “Hiranmayi” is a tale lushly told, of an era gone by, child marriages and dark rooms, stark lives lit by hope, wives abandoned by terribly traditional in-laws.Relief comes with Cheryl-Ann Couto's “Slim Pickings”, hilarious and acutely observed, a warmth that dissipates unbelievably in the echoes of an old tragedy. “The Last Supper In Delhi” is elegantly told, of high living in the Capital, of art and partying, surprise end to a year-end celebration. “The Dining Table” is the story of memory and family, and “Bankru't” takes place in Indonesia with discussions about West Bengal's politics and economics, finally reaching an unexpected twist which can only bring resolution.Radha Nair's “A Grand Repast” takes an admiring look at an uncle in a Kerala household, a connoisseur whose fanatic enjoyment of cooked fish is a celebration of life.
Poetic takes
Manash Bhattacharya's three poems use sudden words and conceits, juggling up images and whimsical insight to commemorate love. (“But I remember how you had first/ stirred inside my head like a child/ in a sick mother's womb.”) And Radha Sinha's two poems conclude the book, straightforward and resonant: “Love songs remind me of you and I when we weren't us./ We were mad, free. We were our children./ Now all they do is remind me of what we'll never be.”First Proof 5is a book worth returning to, though one wishes someone had given it a second proof-reading.

889,Flavours of the north-east,RANJITA BISWAS,2010-05-06,19:04:33 IST,"The debate over whether a translated work destroys the flavour of the original is long over, one assumes. Thankfully! Without translation, voices from around the world, excluding English or any major language, would have been confined into cocoons. In India itself, regional literature is of great dimension. But for the translations, lovers of literature would have been in a limbo to taste local flavours.For instance, the Assamese language, mainly spoken in the Brahmaputra Valley has a rich literary tradition. Contemporary Assamese short stories are some of the best in the country today, acknowledge litterateurs basing their view on the limited number of translations available in English.
Varied themes
Well-known journalist and translator Dhirendra Nath Bezboruah's A Game of Chess, a compilation of fifteen stories, gives a glimpse of the richness and variety of themes in modern Assamese short stories. Starting with “The Decision” by Syed Abdul Malik, a path-breaking writer from the 1950s, which etches a delightful cameo of a woman (Aimoni) with a mind of her own, and wrapped up with “Parable of an Ancient Triangle” by young writer Moushumi Kandali on the dilemma of a feminist and her student, the anthology covers a wide range of human situations.Within this range figure some of the most famous short stories in contemporary Assamese language. Bhabendra Nath Saikia, who ushered in a new era in Assamese literature in the 1960s with his insightful observation of the human character and situation, features in three stories. ‘The Cavern” is a sardonic look at such a situation as a White supremacy believer's heart gets transplanted by a Black man's heart and its effect on him, in an oblique reference to South Africa which was still practising Apartheid and where also the world's first heart transplant took place.“A Game of Chess” by Saurabh Kumar Chaliha, known for his eclectic choice of themes, plays another kind of psychological game with two friends, one successful, the other loser, over a chess-board. His “Bonsai” – on modern society's penchant for consumerism and clever marketing ploys by manufacturers with affordable mini versions of products - ‘sachets' of shampoo or coffee available even in rural backwaters, leaves one wondering – would people enjoy mini-literature, mini-bananas, etc?Jnanpith Award winner Indira Goswami's “The Journey”, Atulananda Goswami's “Munni's Legs” and Harekrishna Deka's “The Prisoner” are reflections on the unstable state of affairs in the region due to the long-drawn insurgency and conflict and their effect on ordinary people.Manoj Goswami's sheering “Samiran Borua is on His Way” resonates with the sighs of idealists anywhere, left behind by a society moving on while they themselves lose their youth and home hoping to change an unjust society.
Global feel
The locale of Arupa Patagia Kalita's “A Nymph of the Desert” moves from the lush green valley of Assam to the arid desert of Rajasthan but the theme of urban-rural divide, of anorexic socialites and starving desert women, can be placed anywhere – even today, and perhaps more so in this global-economic village.Apurba Sharma's “Monica and Vikram” drawing on one of the India's famous myth story characters — Betaal and Vikramaditya, to transplant into a modern version is an interesting experiment but the story is too long and at times gets tedious with social comments verging on lectures on social ills.By the translator-editor's own admission, the anthology does not make “claims of ..being a representative collection of any era or period of time” but chosen because he felt ‘impelled' to translate them. “It is possible to have forty or fifty anthologies of good Assamese short stories in translation,” he writes in the preface. Yet the book gives a worthy glimpse into the wealth of this literature from the North East.The meticulous translation with an eye to maintaining the local flavour, a glossary of local words and their meanings, and profiles of the original authors add to the value to the book.

890,Rich encounters,VIJAY NAMBISAN,2010-05-06,19:03:29 IST,"It so happened that I read this book at a time when I was having to speak five languages on a daily basis. None of them was new; but reading this made me aware of what I was doing. I could almost sense the different brain paths in use, and I was certainly sensible of a different cultural approach to each. It was the best way – and one I could never have planned – to appreciate Rich's experience of learning Hindi from scratch.
Writerly forays
Rich's background is with magazines, not academics. Why she chose to learn Hindi is never clearly spelled out. She'd lost her job, and was recovering from cancer. (She wrote an award-winning book about her battle with “The Red Devil”.) She lied to an editor who'd asked her for some freelance work, saying “I'll be in India,” and was told, “Do something for us there.”From Delhi, she was sent to an academy in Udaipur which taught foreign students. She arrived at a difficult time: five days before the attacks on New York, and that was followed in short order by the attack on Parliament, then came Godhra and the subsequent carnage. Her magazine background serves her well. She details with painstaking and sometimes painful honesty her reactions to the hatred spewed by fanatics everywhere, the branding of humans by community. There was then a palpable, shimmering unease in the air which she describes elegantly.Personal relationships are her metier. Her depictions of social dynamics at the language academy, with her various local hosts, among the expats, at a school for deaf children – all these leaven the narrative and make absorbing reading. She also has a gift for concisely expressing complex ideas. What adds great value is her attempts, before and after her Indian sojourn, to pin down the physiology of language skills. She has spoken to and read many experts, with almost as many theories. She offers these lucidly and convincingly where relevant to her story.
An instance, at random:
Recently, a cognitive neurolinguist at the University of Washington made an extraordinary discovery about the extent to which our brains understand more than we can say. [He] scanned neophyte French students… using a device that measures electrical activity in the brain. At two weeks in, after test participants had received only eight hours of instruction, [he] attached electrodes to their scalps and showed them lists of words. Some were French, some made up. When they were asked to say which were which, they did as expected: scored, on average, 50 per cent. They guessed…. But the scans showed their brains were getting the answers right.There are too many such remarkable findings to quote in a review.Rich falls into many of the traps India sets for Westerners. There is the inapposite caste-naming, for example: “the pretty Brahmin teacher”. When she wants to talk to “a dalit”, any dalit, she is warned off by an instructor. Is it so difficult, finding “a dalit”? There are outdated notions of Indian women living a secret life. (This is perhaps not so outdated in Rajasthan. But then she shouldn't talk of “Indian women”.)To be fair, she makes her own bloomers too. She confuses the Indian Congress with the American idea; says south Indian languages are as far from Hindi as English is from Mandarin; describes the charkha as having adorned the Indian flag for many years…. And ye gods, her spellings: “atmaan, Brahmaan”, “mendhi”, “Vidyala” – I wonder why, if Westland must reprint an American book for us, they can't correct these things.Though Rich achieved, in some measure, her dream of dreaming in Hindi, her language skills cannot be very considerable. Her Hindi is of that Sanskritic order which is taught in schools, and rings quaintly to the man in the street. Rajasthan is not the best place to learn the lingua Indica. Her English, too, like that of so many American writers (and Indian journalists), is often found to settle for the approximate rather than the exact. On the same page I find “a trifling” used for “a trifle” and “precedence” for “precedent”.But working polyglots, unlike academics and UN interpreters, need to communicate, not dazzle. It is Rich's journey that is fascinating. She did not undertake it for any material reward (though this book must be selling), but for the excitement of what she discovered along the way. That is its own reward, both for her and the reader. A professional academic would have written a more factually accurate account. She would have used more method. She would also, nine times out of ten, have been boring. It is precisely Rich's peripatetic approach that gives this book its charm. So long as it is not used as a guide – but that is, unfortunately, just how the unwary and lazy will use it. Bhai, zaraa dekhke chalo.
Vijay Nambisan's translations of two 16th century Kerala poems were published last year.

891,Celebrating the academic poet,M.S. NAGARAJAN,2010-05-06,19:01:30 IST,"Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a short anthology of seventy-five “lyrical poems with soft, sensuous and passionate lines” composed on different occasions spanning a period of nearly three decades. She has had the advantage of getting to know, rather intimately, her contemporaries, poets who helped shape her poems, offering suggestions and putting her on the right track.Nissim Ezekiel who was a pathfinder for many of the younger generation brought her into contact with Gieve Patel, Kamala Das, Dom Moraes and others. Arun Kolatkar and Adil Jussawalla too had their bit of role in promoting her poems. More than all, the academic circle she grew up in afforded a lot of exposure to good and great poetry. In this sense, it is right to place her among the group of Indian academic poets of the post-independence era.Her early ‘Catholic' poems from her collection Fix are autobiographical—if not confessional—in nature, helping us gain a peep into the nature of her later poetry.The beliefs and disbeliefs of the Goan-Catholic community of Mumbaikars provide her with enough material for a conducted tour, as it were, of the inner lives of this group of people. “Catholic Mother” provides four biting — if not scornful — snapshots of her family. The father believes that God always provides for that big family of seven young children. According to the parish priest, he is the pillar of the church, and for Mother Superior, it is a lovely Catholic family. The last line that her mother ‘says nothing' is ambivalent. Profoundly intimate, yet aesthetically distant, is the poem an acceptance or a denial of father's role and presence? The poet stands outside in a distanced position from which she can apprehend the fallacies of both positions.Institutionalised religious morality and subjective personal judgments can both fall outside the domain of true experience of human life.Eunice De Souza's poems are narrative in style, simple and direct oftentimes but the ideas they explore are not as simple as all that. The poem “Mid Sentence” from her collection of “Recent Poems” is illustrative of this mode. There is no wailing, no sentimental cries. There is just the banal closing line; ‘It was thoughtless to vanish so suddenly,' referring to the sudden passing away of someone (Finis. Kaput. Dead.) whose identity is not revealed. There is a commingling of a joyous life full of hope and expectation with the sudden close with ‘neither harp nor halo.'The lyric expands the metaphor of the opening line, “You left mid-sentence…” Death looms large in the anthology the title of which (“A Necklace of Skulls”) seems deliberate.The influence of William Blake on Eunice De Souza is unmistakable: the two of the longest poems, “Songs of Survival” and “Songs of Innocence” bear an echo of Blake. But unlike Blake who portrays complementary and opposing views on the transcendent mystery of creation as in “The Lamb” and “The Tyger,” these two companion pieces present related views enquiring into the phenomena of innocence and survival.Standing outside the two perceptions, the poet explores the limitations of being ‘happy with him forever/in this world and the next,' (innocence), while denouncing the self-deprecating attitudes, extols the philosophy of stoicism and the Schopenhauerean virtues of the will to live. The poems of De Souza are well-wrought lyrics, inflexible and firm, short in design. In fact the very economy of utterances helps her in arriving at such a delicately finished form.Full of understatements, avoiding any external aid in the form of conceits, metaphors or symbols, Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a welcome addition to the Indo-Anglian shelf.

892,Too many loose ends,SAAZ AGGARWAL,2010-05-06,18:59:44 IST,"The House on Mall Road
  Parvati is 27-years-old and this is the story of a journey she makes to try and find out what exactly happened 20 years ago when tragedy irretrievably changed her circumstances.Travelling with her, we learn something about life in an army cantonment near the border and the dangers that we, sitting comfortably curled up and reading novels, are safe from. The discipline, the atmosphere of wide spaces, smartly-uniformed personnel of every rank, the abundance of various resources, the monotonous routine, the deceptively jolly and rotund officers (eagle-eyed and razor-sharp is what they really are) and the wonderfully warm but empty-headed and appearance-obsessed women (yes, some of them can be vicious and career-ruining spiteful too) are plainly described. We also discern shades of the emotional spectrum of army life – not just pride in country and fearlessness in the face of peril but also the unique conflicts within the ranks and between other groups such as police and civilians, and the classless society formed by people from so many different backgrounds.Romance enters Parvati’s story in a straightforward way but you will wait in vain for what would once have been a logical conclusion. And while you may consider this the mark of a modern story, in many ways, and particularly in its use of language, this book is anachronistic.What is it about the IIM-A novelists? Is it that difficult to put a good story together using a healthy, global – or even consistently local – idiom? With Chetan Bhagat, the story roars along without even pretending to strive for a style that could be admired. This book, on the other hand, has nothing that either Wren or Martin could object to. However, it is strewn with dated expressions like “attaché” case and “reel” for photo film roll; malapropisms as in “I am mortified of snakes”; ill-chosen adjectives as in “no offence to your fabulous profession” and the word “nice” (which shrewd writers will display before a reviewer only, and only, as a remedy for constipation) FOUR TIMES on one page – oh my god! Occasional lapses into new age concepts (“personal boundaries”; “but in a nice way”) evoke the precocious child trying out a new word, proud and a little self-conscious.If your benchmark of a good book is that, from one end to the other, you feel the characters as real people and can experience them change or grow, you will have one more reason to feel disappointed. The people here are static and at most capable of performing random unexpected acts. The narrator herself fails to claim your being, as a skilled narrator would – she’s somewhat shadowy, a tinselly voice and at best a collection of opinions.I did enjoy the series of implausible coincidences (but then truth is always stranger than fiction) and the surge of emotion towards the end of the book. However, too many loose ends were left hanging: strange happenings that are never explained and even the ghost of someone who hadn’t died after all. This book lacks the grace of a natural story. If I wasn’t reading it as a reviewer, I would never have carried on to the end.Reading Pico Iyer’s enthusiastic endorsement on the cover, I had grabbed it with excitement, anticipating the matchless pleasure of reading a wonderful first book by a talented new writer of fiction. As I read, however, excitement turned to disbelief, and then to annoyance.I’ve always been a fan of Pico Iyer’s elegant writing style. His words flow smooth and pleasing, unassuming, and often stunningly effective. I’m afraid that his description of this mediocre, clumsily-written story as “a rich and wonderfully-accomplished debut” made me wonder what sort of pressure exactly he had been under when he made it.

893,No mystery here,PARVATHI NAYAR,2010-05-06,18:58:02 IST,"The Swan Thieves by Elizabeth Kostova
  Elizabeth Kostova’s retelling of the Dracula myth, The Historian (2005), was a runaway success, a doubly creditable feat considering it was her debut novel. Logical then that she has returned to the same idea of the historical thriller with a literary bent in her latest, The Swan Thieves. Here, she turns her talents to another myth that has captured public imagination since ancient times – that of the tortured genius artist.Cleverly, Kostova sets her mystery within the time period of an enduringly popular art “ism” – i.e., Impressionism. It’s not just the continuing beauty and craftsmanship of the works that make the Impressionists so fascinating, but also that the artists were rebels of their time, who dared to see and paint things differently, thereby challenging the popular idiom.
The Swan Thieves follows two story lines that unfold through multiple voices, letters and journals. In the past lies the tale of Beatrice de Clerval, an unsung Impressionist genius of 19th-century Paris. But de Clerval’s influence extends in a mysterious manner all the way to the present - and indirectly changes forever, the lives of many people including that of the book’s chief narrator, painter/psychiatrist Dr. Andrew Marlow.Dr. Marlow’s skill lies is inducing people to open up; we are told he has the ability to get “a stone to talk”. As a result, a strange new patient is admitted into his care, the talented artist Robert Oliver. Oliver is described as a traditionalist - “I actually don’t care about concepts very much,” he growls, preferring instead to draw traditional landscapes, portraits and still lives - but with such facility that even the unforgiving avant-garde art world of the present day cannot help but recognise his talent.Oliver gets into psychiatric treatment after apparently attacking a painting depicting Leda and the swan at the National Gallery with a knife. But after an initial conversation, Oliver doesn’t break his stony silence with Dr. Marlow – which apart from anything else, calls into serious question the doctor’s ability to engage rocks and boulders in meaningful conversation.At the psychiatric facility of Goldengrove in Rockville, Oliver mostly seems to engage in activity of the “pacing the room… clenching and unclenching his jaw” genre. He also draws and paints a mysterious woman over and over – and over – again. Though painted directly from his imagination with no model, these drawings were “alive, beyond alive” we are told in hushed prose. But since Oliver refuses to talk, his motives are a mystery to all concerned. Frankly, however, as we plough through over 500 pages of narrative of how Oliver has put several people through a lot of misery thanks to his self-absorbed ways as some sort of possessed genius, we stop caring too much about the tortured artist’s misery.Dr. Marlow himself is not the most appetising of protagonists and his eye for a pretty face is, well, a bit weird. Admittedly he is pursuing Oliver’s former loves – real and imaginary – in the name of detecting, uncovering the mystery and curing his patient. However he seems far more smitten by Oliver’s women than trying to help his patient. Kostova, actually, has a thing going with age in her book, what with nubile young women constantly falling for generationally older men throughout her narrative. Some of the women also give up on their art for reasons related to the men in their lives.Almost every major character in the book draws and paints – but each of their painterly visions come off sounding disconcertingly alike. It’s hard to tell the voices apart and as a result the characterisations aren’t distinct. At one level this makes the book a bit of a uniform and plodding read – at another, this homogenisation deeply undercuts the book’s belief in the artist as an individual who sees the world differently and expresses this vision in deeply distinctive ways.Kostova tries hard to evoke the mystery of creating art as she plots out the mystery in her novel, but the descriptions sound laboured. It is a subject many authors have attempted, but the truth of the matter is that writing about painting really isn’t an easy task – it is the same ambitious leap as trying to paint what’s written between the covers of a book.

  Someone e-mailed me this joke recently: In New York’s Central Park, a huge Rottweiler breaks loose from its leash and savages a small blonde child. A skinny young man rushes up and, at great risk to himself, saves the child by wrestling the dog to the ground and finally, in desperation, killing it.When it’s all over, the child’s mother comes up to the little bloodied man and thanks him profusely. It turns out she’s a famous journalist and she tells him she’s going to run a front page story about him in the New York Times headlined, “American hero saves child from vicious monster”. “But madam, I’m not American,” the little man replies. “Oh, what are you then?” asks the journalist. “I’m a Pakistani, madam”.So the next day’s New York Times carries a screaming headline, “Terrorist strangles pet dog”.No, it is not a great time to be a Pakistani. Your country is collapsing around you; your political system is one of the most rotten in the world; your society is fractured down the centre; the religious loonies are baying at the gates of your home. For many years Pakistanis who had the talent or the means usually chose to escape overseas, but in today’s world the ‘T’ word hangs threateningly over their heads wherever they go. And that is what Husain Naqvi’s Home Boy is all about.Boulevardiers and raconteursIt’s the story of three Pakistani 20-somethings living in Manhattan: Shehzad (“Chuck”), an investment banker; Jimbo, a hip-hop deejay; and AC, a dilettante and intellectual bum. They are “boulevardiers, raconteurs, renaissance men.” They hang around their favourite Tribeca bar-lounge, drinking vodka-on-the-rocks with a gaggle of socialites, arrivistes, metro-sexuals and wannabe models. They work; they play; they listen to Afro-jazz; they get in and out of trouble; they make pilgrimages to Jackson Heights to eat kabab-roti. But the theme that always seems to be playing in the background is the situation back home and “Hey-I-believe-Musharraf-is-making-an-important–speech-on-TV-today-don’t-miss-it.”After 9/11, however, the world is not the same for someone with a brown skin and a Muslim name. The three boulevardiers do something silly and the next thing they know is they’re blindfolded and squatting on the floor of a detention centre. Their homes are raided; a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook on the bookshelf is construed to be a bomb-making manual; Ibn Khaldun’s great philosophical classic Muqadimah is made out to be some kind of Islamic terror guide. And suddenly there’s an enormous FBI interrogator looming over them, saying “No phone call, no lawyer, no nothing. And if you’re lucky someday we’ll put you on a plane with a one-way ticket to Bumfuckistan. So let’s start again….” In today’s world, it’s something that could easily happen to you, or to me.
Stylish and eclectic
Naqvi writes with a stylishness and eclecticism that is so self-assured it’s almost arrogant: the fact that the book opens upon three selected quotes - the first from F. Scott Fitzgerald, the second from Urdu poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and the third from hip-hop artists, Eric B. & Rakim - is just an indication of the shape of things to come. But then Naqvi is a man who grew up in Algiers, graduated from Georgetown University, worked as an investment banker, has been a slam poet, and taught creative writing at Boston University. In fact he claims that Home Boy actually began as a slam poem, scribbled on a cocktail napkin in 1993, after his brother was routinely picked up by the cops for interrogation. And it’s that slam poet’s instinct that buzzes below the book’s sharp, sleek prose and its tightly wrought structure.
Home Boy was selected as one of the top 10 novels of the year by the Huffington Post, alongside Orhan Pamuk’s The Museum of Innocence and Ha Jin’s A Great Fall. So if I say it is one of the richest, most stylish novels I’ve read in a long time, I am in good company.

  Exploring this novel is somewhat like opening a carefully preserved album of beautiful images and wondering if they’ll survive the harsh light of scrutiny. Any work of fiction that dares to toy with the historical past risks courting that danger. And the final days of the Raj, in particular — the subject of The Last Victory — has inspired so many memorable tomes that yet another novel, which gives it pride of place would, one imagines, invite more intense critical attention than most.But Timeri N. Murari’s grand Raj production (for that is how this sequel to The Imperial Agent comes across) will probably get away unscathed. Its meticulously researched historical backdrop notwithstanding, the book adroitly escapes being judged by the criteria that would apply to a historical novel. The thoroughness of this research is evident as the author weaves his suspense-charged fictional episodes around real-life events — among them, World War I and the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre — and smoothly incorporates personalities like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru into his narrative, making them come alive in imagined sequences, even if there is a tendency towards stereotyping in the delineation of such characters as General Reginald Dyer of Jallianwallah Bagh notoriety who vows to “teach the bloody wogs a lesson they’ll never forget”.Murari’s most inspired writing comes, however, from his portrait of another India, the one that happily accommodates demons and double agents, patriot-terrorists turned “
sanyasis” and brigands who rule the Chambal’s ravines, island palaces and temples to the snake god, hired assassins lurking in the shadows and zamindars who conspire from their thrones of ivory “the colour of fading sunlight”, evil spells and local superstitions and, of course, those rare and wondrous beings, Bala and Bala, blind twins with the power to transform people and places through their magical songs so that they are never again the same. In other words, oodles of exotica that lend the story the innocent charm of a fairy tale, while playing quite unabashedly on the old Western fixation — perpetuated partly by Hollywood — with the Orient’s supposedly unfathomable mystique.Appropriately enough, the hero is an “
Angrezi” born, but Indian “by love and thought”. Resurrected by the author from Kim, Rudyard Kipling’s creation, Kimball O’Hara is “a friend of the world”, brave, honourable and compassionate, with an embarrassing resemblance to the yesteryear Hollywood heroes some of us had massive crushes on long, long ago and now condescend to remember with a self-deprecating smile. It’s inevitable that Murari’s Kim, who takes up from where he had left off in The Imperial Agent, should be required in this novel to elude assassins, battle dacoits, fight superstition, exorcise demons and stand up to his former mentor, Colonel Creighton, who swears by Rule Britannia and would, if necessary, betray his own protégé to safeguard the interests of the Empire.It’s no surprise either that Kim’s love interest should be the beautiful Mohini/ Parvati, the original damsel in distress who can, when required, be bold enough to engage in anti-colonial activities, flee a brutal husband, love a man from another race (even if her romantic interludes with him are frustratingly chaste), bear him a child out of wedlock and ultimately carry out an act we wouldn’t have dreamed her capable of, so weepy and whisper-soft has her creator rendered her, the perfect prototype, it would seem, of the demure Oriental maiden with great hidden potential.Add Murari’s rich gallery of cameos and red-hot action sequences interspersed with lyrical passages and you have a potent, if quaint, cocktail of entertainment.It’s not difficult to understand why this author’s popularity has endured over the decades, despite changing literary tastes. Murari can remain secure in the knowledge that The Last Victory offers much, including some great celluloid moments that will lure us into a willing suspension of disbelief so that going with the flow follows naturally. Despite the faint whiff of mothballs, there’s much to be said, after all, for a reassuringly linear narrative, larger-than-life characters, a generous slice of realism, both magical and otherwise, high-voltage drama and an assured prose style that adapts itself easily to the demands of the context and is as invigorating as a breath of fresh air.

896,Against the tyranny of facts,SUBASH JEYAN,2010-05-06,18:52:04 IST,"Lest we forget: Yann Martel. Photo: MACARENA YANEZ
  
Yann Martel's second novel has been a long time coming. Recently released in Canada and the US, 
Beatrice and Virgil
 has received polarised reviews. That it has been trashed as well as praised, he says, is a sign that it has elicited active engagement, not indifference, from the readers. The controversial reception is a sign that it is getting people to think and act, he says from San Francisco where he is on a promotional tour. Excerpts from a telephonic conversation...
Are you planning on coming to India to promote the book here?
I have a nine-month-old son. Before I can promote it — I am not going to Australia, New Zealand — I want to get back and be with my son. So, as much as I would love to return to India, for any reason, not just to promote my books, just to be in India — I haven't been there for about nine years now — I don't know when that'll be. India has changed a lot, I would love to go back and see that.
Is this novel about the primacy of the imagination? You think we live in a world where the profusion of facts is working against making sensible meaning out of it?
Reality is a 100 million details. Right now where you are, if you think about it, you are surrounded by 100 million details on which you could focus your attention. Everything, from chemical, scientific details to cultural details to personal emotional details... now some of that has to be lost. Time, you know, is an eraser. It all goes. [We need] something we can hold on to. It's called history. But even history has hundreds of thousands of details and sometimes it's overwhelming and it's hard to get to. The forte of the arts, the forte of the imagination is that it can take some of those details and give them immortality. A painting, a story, a song can float across the ocean of time like a lifeboat. So you can get to the essence of an event and convey it in the form of art. It can be like a suitcase, taking the essential and preparing you for a trip to elsewhere...
Does ‘getting to the essence' necessarily bring a moral perspective that is lacking in mere facts?
It can be but art isn't necessarily moral. Art could be immoral too. Art is witness. But in some stories, yes, it can also have a moral edge. It can also, in telling a story, convey certain moral situations. Which is what my novel does at the very end — In “Games for Gustav” are these 12 situations that are morally, existentially difficult. So, yes, it can make a moral situation fresh again...
You dwell at length in the initial stages of the novel about the concrete, everyday circumstances around writing /publishing that are usually glossed over. Is it autobiographical and are you saying that though there is a market built around imagination, it is essential to our being and identity?
I didn't do it because I wanted it to be autobiographical, it was more because of the idea of a writer who stops writing, whose message has stopped, suited me because I was discussing the Holocaust. And any great horrific event, the Holocaust, war, has a tendency to erase language, to make us at a loss for words. You know, famously, when people encountered the Accounts, their language was full of clichés to do with “there are no words to describe”, “I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing.” So, to have a writer who is at a loss for words and then to meet the taxidermist who is also in some ways at a loss for words suited my purpose when discussing the Holocaust...so that's why I have that theme.I did indeed have a meeting with my publishers, I did want to do a flip book with them but their argument was different. They were saying, “listen, an essay is a specialised product. A novel is not.” They were afraid the essay would drag down the novel.
You keep coming back to the notion that is art is about joy. The taxidermist is shown as someone who is joyless, cheerless, who plods through his play. “My story has no story. It is based on the fact of murder,” he says at one point. You think the character of the taxidermist is too steretypical, he and the novelist falling easily into opposite sides of a too-easy divide?
Art is joy in a general way. Any art, music, dance, painting, to create at that level is deeply joyful, it involves your whole being. Art and religion are the two ways in which we fully engage with life. In this particular case, I enjoyed wrestling with that subject. I wanted to make the taxidermist ambiguous. He clearly has some sort of a creative impulse, he is working on a play, he is quite rude with the writer. I wanted someone whom we wouldn't understand why he was doing the things he was doing until the very end and even then we are not sure what his intent was.And that to me was the parallel of the encounter of the Jews of Europe with the Nazis who did not see it coming. By the time they realised fully what the Nazis' intents were, it was too late, they couldn't escape and that's why so many died.
How has the novel been received?
It's been very interesting and very polarised. Some critics absolutely hated it. I got absolutely trashed by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and there's some blogger on the Internet named Edward Champion who absolutely hated it. And then you have reviewers who absolutely loved it. The USA Today thought it was positively a masterpiece. There were very positive reviews in Newsweek and the LA Times. So it's been very polarised, which is good. The one thing you don't want with art is indifference. You don't want people to shrug. Even when people hate it, they are engaging with it.
Is there some sort of thematic continuity or evolution between 
Life of Pi
 and 
Beatrice and Virgil

? If the former was about God, faith and religion, the latter is about imagination and art, isn't it?In some ways they are very different books. Yes, they both feature animals but that's just on the surface. In Life of Pi hopefully the reader loses himself looking at those animals. Forget may be his humanity. In Beatrice and Virgil those animals are anthropomorphised and are meant to bring us back to our humanity.And as for the role of the imagination, to me it's something more immediate like life itself is an interpretation. We cannot choose the reality we live in, but we can choose how we interpret it. In that sense, imagination is not something whimsical, fairy-tale like, I am simply saying that reality is a co-creation, reality is something which is out there but it is also how you take it. To that extent, I suppose there is a similarity between the two novels in the sense that how you represent reality will speak of how you see it, of what that reality is. A person of faith reads transcendendance into the world, sees a divine plan; I suppose it is the same with reading history. You are representing an event that is past, and in that representation there is an element of interpretation, of imaginative reading. In that way there is a thematic link between the two novels.
To me this novel seems to come behind a line of books from the West dealing with the Holocaust. Why this obsession in the West about the Holocaust? There are historical continuities to the Holocaust in the contemporary world like what is happening in Palestine, Gaza today, injustices, perhaps of equal magnitude. Nobody seems to talk about them much...
Well, aside of the politics of West Asia, which poisons everything, just looking in terms of history, the Holocaust still remains unique: every other genocide before and after has to some extent been politically expedient. The Armenians in Turkey were killed because they were in the way of the Turks who were trying to start their nation. Excesses in Gaza were committed because of political enmity between the Palestinians and the Israelis. In both cases you killed people who were in the way, who bothered you but the ones beyond a certain border were irrelevant to you. But the Nazis were obsessed with killing the Jews everywhere, as if they were a disease. That does remain unique. And the reason I think it is still relevant, not a piece of historical arcana from several years ago in the backwaters of Poland, is because what led to the Holocaust is still absolutely contemporary.The act of hate, the thinking of hatred, the disrespect in the mind of an individual that eventually in Germany led to the Holocaust, that little beginning, that seed of hatred is found everywhere. The Holocaust is not rooted in Auschwitz, in Poland. It is rooted in the human heart. And that applies to India too. There are people in India with holocaustal thinking, for example the BJP, the Shiv Sena, you know, that kind of hatred of the other whom you don't even know, who is just a construction in your mind to relieve tension, to relieve whatever... that is holocaustal. Now because India is democracy, there is a free press, it is unlikely that there will ever be a genocide but the roots are there...The thing about this novel is that it is not an orthodox Holocaust novel. There is no history in there, there are no Germans, there is minimal reference to the Holocaust yet it is soaked in it.So I do choose the Holocaust but not just as a historical artefact, I am looking at what is to me relevant. At the very end, there are 12 more situations where there is no historical colour or detail that put you at the heart of it. And those 12 situations could take place in India. You could be in a line of people about to be executed and you could be holding your grand daughter's hand and she asks you a question. And what might that question be? What would a child be thinking when it sees people being massacred? That completely fits in with realities in India today. That's why I think it's still relevant...
Exclusive excerpts from Yann Martel's 
Beatrice and Virgil

…
(Virgil and Beatrice are sitting at the foot of the tree. They are looking out blankly. Silence
.)
Virgil: What I'd give for a pear.

Beatrice: A pear?

Virgil: Yes. A ripe and juicy one.

Beatrice: I've never had a pear.

Virgil: What?

Beatrice: In fact, I don't think I've ever set eyes on one.

Virgil: How is that possible? It's a common fruit.

Beatrice: My parents were always eating apples and carrots. I guess they didn't like pears.

Virgil: But pears are so good! I bet you there's a pear tree right around here. (He looks about.)

Beatrice: Describe a pear for me. What is a pear like?

Virgil: (settling back) I can try. Let's see . . . To start with, a pear has an unusual shape. It's round and fat on the bottom, but tapered on top.

Beatrice: Like a gourd.

Virgil: A gourd
? You know gourds but you don't know pears? How odd the things we know and don't. At any rate, no, a pear is smaller than an average gourd, and its shape is more pleasing to the eye. A pear becomes tapered in a symmetrical way, its upper half sitting straight and centred atop its lower half. Can you see what I mean?
Beatrice: I think so.

Virgil: Let's start with the bottom half. Can you imagine a fruit that is round and fat?

Beatrice: Like an apple?

Virgil: Not quite. If you look at an apple with your mind's eye, you will notice that the girth of the apple is at its widest either in the middle of the fruit or in the top third, isn't that so?

Beatrice: You're right. A pear is not like this?

Virgil: No. You must imagine an apple that is at its widest in the bottom third.

Beatrice: I can see it.

Virgil: But we must not push the comparison too far. The bottom of a pear is not like an apple's.

Beatrice: No?

Virgil: No. Most apples sit on their buttocks, so to speak, on a circular ridge or on four or five points that keep them from falling over. Past the buttocks, a little ways up, there's what would be the anus of the fruit if the fruit were a beast.

Beatrice: I see precisely what you mean.

Virgil: Well, a pear is not like that. A pear has no buttocks. Its bottom is round.

Beatrice: So how does it stay up?

Virgil: It doesn't. A pear either dangles from a tree or lies on its side.

Beatrice: As clumsy as an egg.

Virgil: There's something else about the bottom of a pear: most pears do not have those vertical grooves that some apples have. Most pears have smooth, round, even bottoms.

Beatrice: How enchanting.

Virgil: It certainly is. Now let us move north past our fruity equator.

Beatrice: I'm following you.

Virgil: There comes this tapering I was telling you about.

Beatrice: I can't quite see it. Does the fruit come to a point? Is it shaped like a cone?

Virgil: No. Imagine the tip of a banana.

Beatrice: Which tip?

Virgil: The end tip, the one you hold in your hand when you're eating one.

Beatrice: What kind of banana? There are hundreds of varieties.

Virgil: Are there?

Beatrice: Yes. Some are as small as fat fingers, others are real clubs. And their shapes vary too, as do their taste.

Virgil: I mean the regular, yellow ones that taste really good.

Beatrice: The common banana, M. sapientum
. You probably have the Gros Michel variety in mind.
Virgil: I'm impressed.

Beatrice: I know bananas.

Virgil: Better than a monkey. Take the end tip of a common banana, then, and place it on top of an apple, taking into account the differences between apples and pears that I've just described.

Beatrice: An interesting graft.

Virgil: Now make the lines smoother, gentler. Let the banana flare out in a friendly way as it merges into the apple. Can you see it?

Beatrice: I believe I can.

Virgil: One last detail. At the very top of this apple-banana composite, add a surprisingly tough stalk, a real tree trunk of a stalk. There, you have an approximation of a pear.

Beatrice: A pear sounds like a beautiful fruit.

Virgil: It is. In colour, commonly, a pear is yellow with black spots.

Beatrice: Like a banana again.

897,Questions of identity,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,18:49:20 IST,"Aatish Taseer's The Temple-goers
  The narrator of Aatish Taseer’s debut novel is a young man named Aatish Taseer, and some of the details of his life appear drawn from the author’s. The device is guaranteed to raise questions about exactly how “autobiographical” The Temple-goers is (as if such things are neatly quantifiable), but that would be to miss the wood for the trees; this is a book that encourages us to ask subtler – and more interesting – questions about identity.The fictional Aatish is a young writer born to privilege. After a few years studying and working in America and England he’s just returned to Delhi to revise a novel, and he has access to two apartments – his mother’s and his girlfriend Sanyogita’s – in the high-end colonies that border Lutyen’s Delhi. A citizen of the world, Aatish is estranged from non-cosmopolitan India, and always conscious of – and uneasy about – this estrangement.This is reflected early on, in the book’s descriptions. When he writes about places like Jorbagh and Lodhi Gardens, he does it with precision and familiarity. But he’s on less firm ground with other parts of Delhi, including its growing satellite towns, and the novel is deliberately non-specific about those parts. Instead of Noida or Ghaziabad, they are given the abstract names “Sectorpur” and “Phasenagar”. The impression one gets is of a city map where the posh colonies of south-central Delhi are in sharp relief but the names get blurred as the map spreads outwards, until the satellite towns are anonymous smudges: unknowable and frightening places to someone who has led a sheltered life.We are prepared, then, for the fascination Aatish feels towards the book’s other major figure, a fitness trainer named Aakash who lives in a lower-income-group flat in Sectorpur. “Double A like me!” Aakash exclaims when he learns Aatish’s name, the first time they meet, but gradually we will come to see how Aakash himself is something of a double, a doppelganger for our narrator. He’s a developed character in his own right, but it’s also possible to see him as a figure born in Aatish’s subconscious, threatening and attractive in equal measure. As a high-caste Brahmin, seemingly very sure of his place in the world, he is an object of envy, and Aatish’s descriptions of him have a ring of awe (“His small, powerful body hovered over mine, the rope of black religious strings hanging down like a noose…”). When he shows up – as a security guard – at an upper-crust Holi party where Aatish is a guest, and later, when he invites himself to Aatish’s flat, there is a hint of rupture, of one world intruding on another.Their improbable friendship deepens: Aatish goes on a day trip with Aakash and his family to an ancestral village temple; later, he accompanies him to the home of a middle-aged prostitute where they share a different sort of intimacy. Aatish’s interest in his new friend’s life may suggest a novelist collecting material for his next book, but it’s just as likely that he is trying to understand himself and the country he wants badly to belong to.
The Temple-goers is a carefully crafted book in which even seemingly marginal scenes (such as a description of a writers’ meet where a young man reads out a short story that may or may not be an account of a real-life incident) become significant in retrospect. This carefulness can also be seen in its examination of identity – national, communal and personal.In his first book Stranger to History, Taseer – whose estranged father is a Pakistani Muslim – described his journeys through various Islamic countries to try and understand how the religion manifests itself in different places. The Temple-goers is, in part, a complementary examination of Hinduism, a religion that had pagan roots and was not founded on a fixed belief system; the repercussions – good and bad – of this fluidity; and the growing danger of it being overtaken by fundamentalist forces today.At one point, Aatish’s Urdu teacher Zafar uses the word “
vehshat” to describe India’s “history of animalism and sacrifice”, which he associates with the majority religion. “The land is stained,” he says, “It has seen terrible things: girl children sacrificed, widows burned, the worship of idols.” We are reminded of his words in a later passage set during a jagran, where the master of ceremonies cheerfully tells a story involving the sacrifice of a young boy – and still later, when a gruesome murder takes place in Sectorpur.But it’s equally clear that this is just one perspective, and The Temple-goers offers us others. In one very entertaining passage, ideas of India are bandied about at a dinner party where a V.S. Naipaul-like figure – a writer named Vijaipal – holds centre-stage. Responding to the popular liberal-intellectual stand that India isn’t really a single country at all – that the common man from Gujarat, Assam or Tamil Nadu wouldn’t have the faintest idea of India as a land – this writer declaims that the temple-going Indian “knows this country backwards. He forever carries an idea of it in his head…He knows it through its holy places…there is almost no other country, certainly not one so vast, where the countrymen are as acquainted with the distant reaches of the land through their pilgrimages as they are in India”.Persuasive though this monologue is, the reader might well wonder whether this generic “temple-goer” really is a pan-Indian creature or if what we’re talking about here is again a very specific variety of north Indian religious chauvinism. But then, one of this book’s achievements is that it presents forceful ideas without necessarily throwing in its lot with any of them. The fictional Aatish may have a clear sense of what the future will hold for Indians like him – and for Indians like Aakash – but the real Taseer doesn't give us a broad, over-simplified view of a vast, contradiction-ridden country.

898,The other side of history,ABDULLAH KHAN,2010-05-06,18:46:32 IST,"Susan Abulhawa's book
  The creation of Israel, for Jews, was the fulfilment of 3000 years of yearnings for a Jewish homeland. For Palestinians, it was El Nakba, the catastrophe, which rendered them homeless and forced them, to live in perpetual misery. The Jewish version of the Israel-Palestine story has found a place in English fiction umpteen times; the most popular being Exodus by Leon Uris, a book that generated a huge wave of sympathy in the U.S. for the state of Israel. But there was no novel of mass appeal originally written in English, on this issue from the Palestinian perspective until Susan Abulhawa decided to write one. 
The catastrophe Mornings in Jenin opens in 1941 and centres on a Palestinian family, the Abulhejas, a happy farming family in a picturesque and serene village named Ein Hod near Haifa. But their happiness comes to an abrupt end with the birth of Israel seven years later, as they are forcibly evicted from the land of their forefathers and made to live in a refugee camp in Jenin.  In Jenin, Amal Abulheja, the chief protagonist, is born. With her, we embark on a journey through the tumultuous history of post-1948 Palestine. In between, we also witness the personal losses Amal suffers: her father goes away never to return, her mother becomes insane, her husband is killed in a bombing, her sister-in-law and niece are slaughtered during a massacre and much more. When the journey ends after 325 pages, we are left wondering: How can someone be so brutal to his fellow human beings? How can the victims of a Holocaust metamorphose overnight into the instigators of a catastrophe? How do some people not lose their humanity even in times of extreme adversity? Of course, the book is a work of fiction but the events, from the forceful dispossession of Palestinians in 1948 to the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982, are facts, and many real people inhabit this story of heartbreak, exile, and human tragedy.
Poetic prose
What struck me most is the honesty of the author’s voice. Despite being born to Palestinian refugees of the Six Day War of 1967, she has tried hard not to let her personal feelings fill the text. All individual Jewish characters are portrayed in sympathetic light. Nowhere in the story has she lost the touch of humanity. Another bright aspect of Susan’s writing is her ornamental use of language in the tradition of contemporary Arabic writing. For instance, here is a taste of the opening paragraph from the chapter, ‘‘The Harvest’’: In a distant time, before history marched over the hills and shattered present and future, before wind grabbed the land at one corner and shook it of its name and character, before Amal was born, a small village east of Haifa lived quietly on figs and olives, open frontiers and sunshine. In the nutshell, it is a remarkable novel, which will help us to understand the Israel-Palestine conflict better.

  | Photo Credit: sumanaspati 
“Suddenly there came through the open window the sound of sweet music. Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust. And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, “Go on, little nightingale, go on.”
The nightingale in Hans Christian Andersen's tale is iconic of the life-spirit story-telling has always been.Andersen also foresaw through the tale the fate of genuine art, thought and expression. Earlier in the story, a toy nightingale which always sings the same song in the same vein gets an overwhelming approval rating from his crafty courtiers and his people. The problem: None of them had heard a real nightingale!It is like the fate of classic writings and great literature today. The massive difference in the situation from just a couple of decades ago is striking. To see the real collapse however you will have to peep a little into the vernacular world of contemporary Telugu publishing and reading, and ratings!Why do the classics matter at all? Gandhi Annapaneni realised the difference they make to society during his two years stay as an international student in the erstwhile Soviet Russia. The lack of translations of classic writings especially from the sciences and social sciences in local languages throughout Africa and Asia was a glaring contrast from the situation in Europe. “Accessing and understanding the great ideas and concepts through your own language matters a lot in creating a sturdy intellectual foundation and building up native confidence,” says Gandhi. Considerable good work was done in the decades preceding and following independence in many languages in India but it was primarily focused on bringing in literary works. Even that has become a trickle now.Remarkably, Gandhi's cherished project took shape and evolved amidst such exceedingly adverse climate. By that time sales of ‘serious' Telugu books had plummeted dramatically. Telugu publishing houses had to survive, as they still do, on a hot-mix of vaastu, astrology, religion, personality development and books for competitive exams.The range and variety of the 58 well-translated and attractively produced books in Telugu which Gandhi has brought out in the last five years under the Peacock Classics label, aided of course by a small band of friends and well-wishers, comes as an exceedingly pleasant delight. It is a fine mix of philosophy, science, constitutional law, mythology, folk tales, children's literature and literary classics — ancient, medieval, modern, Indian and foreign. Finding suitable translators who could bring out the essentials of the original in lucid and contemporary Telugu was the most difficult task Gandhi had to face. His persistence shows in the results.Sales figures, though un-encouraging, have not disappointed Gandhi too much. Kaalam Katha, a translation of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time for instance has had seven editions (each 1000 copies). About ten titles including Amma (Maxim Gorky) have done modestly well. The books are priced reasonably. “Yet, most of the target audience for these books, especially in the student community either do not have the resources or are unwilling to spend on books”, feels Gandhi.“The public library system in Andhra Pradesh is no more what it used to be yet there are still 1500 functional libraries spread over the state. So we are inviting people who feel passionately about Telugu and good books in Telugu to pick any work choose any title of their choice from a list of 40 books. The books will be reprinted (with the donor's name) and the copies donated directly to the public libraries,” reveals Gandhi.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Connecting-to-the-classics/article16298720.ece

  My Name is Gauhar Jaan!- The Life and times of a musician, the biography of the first Indian who recorded her voice, was released by Governor of Andhra Pradesh E.S.L. Narasimhan in Chennai on Wednesday.“Reading the book left me with a strange mix of sadness and happiness,” said the Governor.“When Gauhar Jaan excels, you feel happy and when she goes through pangs of separation, pangs of deprivation you feel sad,” he said, adding that the author's in-depth research into various aspects and places is in fact mind boggling, given the constraints of availability of time/material and far flung places.The Governor said “books like these bring back history to the modern generation and provide you a sense of pride in your rich heritage and culture and does leave an impact on the reader.”N. Murali, Senior Managing Director, Kasturi & Sons Ltd, said the book was in line with the current trend of documenting the life of great musicians, while earlier it was considered that art was higher than the artists.“Gauhar Jaan used technology to liberate herself from the exploitation in the hands of patrons of arts. She really democratised music and she was ahead of her time,” he said, recalling how male musicians of earlier days refused to record their voice fearing that doing so would affect their voice.Author of the book Vikram Sampath said Gauhar Jaan visited Chennai in 1910 and her concert in Victoria Hall was a great success. Enthralled by her music, Veena Dhanammal hosted a dinner and she even taught her a Thyagaraja Keertha in suruti raag. Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar learnt a few bhajans from her. She cut close to 600 records. V. Ramnarayan, Editor of the Sruti magazine, said it was not a hagiography, but an honest book.Jayanthi Kumaresh, veena player and teacher of Vikaram Sampath and historians S. Muthaiah and V.

  | Photo Credit: Judi Bottoni In a rare coincidence, researchers working in both Turkey and Iran discovered on the same day how a rare species of bee builds its nest with petals of pink, yellow, blue and purple flowers.The females from the solitary species Osima (Ozbekosima) avoseta line the nest's brood chambers with petals that provide nutrients for the larvae to grow and mature and protect the next generation as they wait out the winter.“It was absolute synchronicity that we all discovered this uncommon behaviour on the same day,” says Jerome Rozen, curator in the division of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History.“In this species, a female shingles the wall of her brood chambers with large pieces of petals or with whole petals, often of many hues,” says Mr. Rozen.“Unfortunately, her larvae never enjoy the brilliant colours of the nest's walls because they have no eyes - and, anyhow, they would need a flashlight!” he said.Mr. Rozen and colleagues were working near Antalya, Turkey while another group of researchers were in the field in Fars Province, Iran.“I'm very proud of the fact that so many authors contributed to this paper,” Mr. Rozen said.Bees are the most important animal pollinators living today and many flowering plants depend on them to reproduce.But nearly 75 percent of bee species - there are about 20,000 species described - are solitary.This means that for the majority of bees, a female constructs a nest for herself and provisions each chamber in the nest with food for the larval stage of her brood.When each chamber is ready, the female deposits an egg and closes the nest if there is only one chamber to a nest, says a release of the American Museum of Natural History.The nests - found in the open - need to be protected from any number of potential threats to their physical structure like compaction of the soil, desiccation, or excessive heating.The survival of solitary bee species also depends on protection from moulds, viruses, bacteria, parasites, and predators.The research was published in American Museum Novitates.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Bee-species-that-builds-its-nest-with-petals/article16298780.ece

During 12 years of follow-up, 125 husbands and 70 wives developed dementia, and both the husband and wife developed dementia in 30 couples.After adjusting for a number of factors, the researchers found that people with a spouse who developed dementia were six times more likely to develop dementia themselves than people whose spouses never had dementia. Men had a higher risk than women. Older age was also significantly associated with dementia risk.“Future studies are needed to determine how much of this association is due to caregiver stress compared to a shared environment,” said study leader Dr. Maria Norton at the university.“On the positive side, the majority of individuals with spouses who develop dementia did not themselves develop dementia, therefore more research is needed to explore which factors distinguish those who are more vulnerable.”“Given the significant public health concern of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and the upcoming shift in population age composition, continued research into the causes of dementia is urgent,” Dr. Norton said.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Alzheimers-may-be-ldquoinfectiousrdquo-among-spouses-study/article16298779.ece

  | Photo Credit: Mikhail Metzel Mammoths had more than woolly coats to protect them from the frigid conditions of their sub-zero stomping grounds, scientists have discovered.The extinct beasts had a form of antifreeze blood that kept their bodies supplied with oxygen in the sub-zero temperatures, according to a study of DNA extracted from 43,000-year-old mammoth remains.A genetic adaptation in the woolly mammoths' haemoglobin - the molecular cage that carries oxygen in the blood - allowed them to thrive at high latitudes without losing much heat.Ancestors of the woolly mammoth originated in equatorial Africa about seven million years ago, but populations migrated north more than one million years ago, in a period of Earth's history when climate change caused temperatures to plummet.Unlike modern elephants, which have evolved large ears and other characteristics to keep cool in excessive heat, ancestral mammoths survived by evolving ways of saving heat, such as small ears and tails.In the latest study, a team led by Kevin Campbell at the University of Manitoba in Canada found another physiological trick that mammoths used to endure the ice age. Campbell's team isolated haemoglobin DNA from a woolly mammoth recovered from the Siberian permafrost and compared it with genetic code extracted from modern African and Asian elephants.The mammoth's DNA differed in a small but significant way. Changes in one percent of the proteins studied showed that it took less energy for mammoth haemoglobin to release its oxygen into the body as it coursed through the blood vessels. “It literally allows their blood to run cold,” Mr. Campbell said.“Without this genetic adaptation, woolly mammoths would lose more heat in winter, and they would have to replace that energy by eating more. In winter, there is less food around, so it was clearly a benefit to have this.” The research is reported in the journal Nature Genetics.Current Arctic species, such as musk ox and reindeer, have evolved a similar antifreeze system independently.Mr. Campbell said the work shows how paleobiology - broadly the study of ancient, extinct life - has come of age. “We resurrected mammoth haemoglobin. It's no different from going back 40,000 years in a time machine and taking a blood sample from the animal.”Michi Hofreiter, a co-author of the study at the University of York, said: “Our study is the first one to reconstruct an evolutionary important, adaptive trait from an extinct species using ancient DNA. It therefore opens up the possibility to build up a much more complete picture of morphology, physiology and evolutionary adaptations than would be possible using non-molecular study of fossil bones.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Mammothsrsquo-survival-trick-ndash-anti-freeze-blood/article16298778.ece
905,Scientists find way to boost nutritional levels of corn,IANS,2010-05-06,18:01:40 IST,"An ear of corn. Photo: AP
  | Photo Credit: Matt Rourke An international team of agricultural scientists has found a way to boost the nutritional value of corn and prevent blindness among children.In Africa and other developing regions, corn is a major staple and hundreds of thousands of children become blind, develop weakened immune systems and die because of diets based largely on corn that lacks sufficient beta-carotene.Corn contains carotenoids, some of which the body can convert to Vitamin A. Beta-carotene is the best Vitamin A precursor, but only a very small percentage of corn varieties have naturally high beta-carotene levels.Marilyn Warburton and Edward Buckler, geneticists with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and colleagues identified genetic sequences linked to higher beta-carotene levels in corn, showing a cheaper and faster way to identify corn plants that will produce even higher levels.The researchers surveyed the genetic sequences of corn from around the world through association mapping, a method made possible by recent breakthroughs that accelerate the genetic profiling of crops.The genetic survey revealed natural variations in one gene sequence linked to higher beta-carotene levels, said an ARS release.These variations interacted with a gene identified previously, and the best variations of the two genes together led to an 18-fold increase in beta-carotene, according to Warburton.The report was recently published in Nature Genetics.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/Scientists-find-way-to-boost-nutritional-levels-of-corn/article16298786.ece

  | Photo Credit: Mail Driven by the multifaceted and intricate human emotions, Mohanmurli Talak is an abstract painter who has been arduously trying to capture the human emotion on the canvas.“Crises of human mind” has remained a pivotal subject in his paintings. The extensive use of light colours which is palpable in his works, Talak has carved a distinct niche for himself in the domain of abstract painting.Being a native of Chitradurga, the 52-year-old self-made painter has largely remained as an unsung artist for the people of his native district.Having exhibited his works in the prestigious art galleries including Y. B. Chavan Art Gallery, Mumbai, Lakshana Art Gallery, Chennai, and Chitrakala Parishat Bangalore, Talak has never undergone any formal course in visual art. It was his immense passion for painting that made him learn the intricacies of abstract painting.Talak uses simple, but varied textures to create his work. He meticulously makes efforts to ensure that his work has a soothing effect on the viewers. “Many people don't even understand the concept of abstract art, however my prime objective is to make people at least change their mood by glancing at my work,” he says.Profoundly inspired by the paintings of the classical painter Raja Ravi Varma who lived between 1848 and 1906, Talak emphatically believes that a painter can contribute towards social change.In the field of art for over 15 years, Talak says that he never had an idea that one day he would become a professional artist. Working as an accountant in a private firm in Chitradurga, he says that the biggest challenge for him was to quit his job to take up painting as a fulltime career.“It was not easy task to convince my wife of quitting a well-paid job, especially when I had an additional responsibility of a young son. Yet, I had a strong conviction for art that made me to go against all odds to prove myself,” he said.“I try to make that has an intimate feel, but also not look vulgar. You can portray nudity without being cheap,” he explains, about an entire series that he has done for one's private space.Talak, who has also created innumerable pen-drawings of historical monuments of Chitradurga, says that a painter through his works could help the place become popular among the tourists.Veerendra Heggade, the chief of Dharmasthala temple is also someone who appreciates his work. According to Talak, several of his works have made place in the Heggade's institutions.Talak feels that the painting exhibitions are gradually shifting their domain from galleries to internet.

907,Evolution of modern art,CHARUKESI,2010-05-06,17:38:15 IST,"Family on scooter: Sculpture at Cholamandal village
  Produced for the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysore, the two-part documentary ‘Modern Art in Tamilnadu' runs for about less than an hour. Yet it appears to have covered most of the vital aspects of the history of Tamil Nadu's art scene from early 1850. The documentary has been directed by Amshan Kumar, writer on films, whose book ‘Cinema Rasanai' is considered a pioneering work in film aesthetics in Tamil.The first part goes back to the genesis of modern art and covers its growth up to the 1960s. The then British rulers established the Government School of Industrial Arts in Madras in 1850 with a view to inculcating Victorian taste among art students. However, it was only in 1929 that modern art took firm roots in Tamil Nadu, when Devi Prasad Roychoudury became the Principal of the School.The statues of Mahatma Gandhi and the Triumph of Labour on Marina, sculpted by him stand testimony to Roychoudury's vision. He was mainly instrumental in inspiring a whole (young) generation interested in modern art and was responsible for establishing ‘Madras School' in the world of art.“There is an interesting story,” says Amshan Kumar. “Once when D.P. Roychoudhury was painting, the coffee he was sipping spilled on it. Students watching him thought that he would discard it. No, he ordered for more cups of coffee and poured all over the canvas and made it one of even tone. This shows his creativity!”It was then the period of K.C.S. Panicker, who took up the mantle of projecting modern art in Tamil Nadu. From water colour he switched on to oil painting. He was the one who laid great emphasis on the Indianness of our art. He founded the Cholamandal Artists' Village.Another institution that nurtured the artistic talents of students came up in Kumbakonam. The town, surrounded by mighty temples, provided ample scope to hone the artistic skills of students on the traditional lines. It was christened the Kumbakonam College of Arts & Crafts in 1962. According to Amshan Kumar, eminent artists such as S. Dhanapal, A.P. Santhana Raj, R. Krishna Rao, R.B. Bhaskaran, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and Alphonso Aruldoss served in both Chennai and Kumbakonam. Works of C.J. Anthony Doss, L. Munusamy, Krishna Rao, P.V. Janakiraman, Ramanujan and a few others are discussed.The second part covers the movement from 1970s till now. It carries the brief interviews of R.B. Bhaskaran, Alphonso Arul Doss, Achuthan Koodallur, K. Muralidharan, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and so on. Adimoolam's transition from black and white line drawings of Gandhiji to abstract oil paintings was as courageous as it was fascinating.
Figure distortion
Famed artist and art director P. Krishnamurthy's opinion that figure distortion, which arrived from the West after experimentation, was indeed introduced by the Indian artists very early on. Artists from the younger generation such as Aparajithan, Shilesh and Srinivasan also find a place with their works.While the English script for the documentary has been done by Lakshmi Venkatraman, the Tamil version has been handled by Amshan Kumar himself. A. Sarangan has wielded the camera and the voice over has been provided by Selvakumar.
Since the venue of the screening was the College premises, majority of the audience was students. Amshan Kumar answered questions posed by them.

Why the documentary chooses to be illustrative and not exhaustive in showing the artists?
“Being the first documentary that chronicles the entire history of modern art in Tamil Nadu, a limited time frame has its own charms and perils. I am not partial towards a few and biased against some of the artists. Duration of time decided the number of artists. Artists featured in this documentary are important, but those who do not are no less important. Inclusion of 50-plus major artists would have made the film like a catalogue and have done justice to none. My aim is more such films should be made and they should bring in artists who are not featured here.
Why did he make this documentary?
My aim is to demystify modern art since in the public mind it is thought of as abstruse and arcane. I think the film has achieved the objective, since many artists have explained their work in great detail and also worked in front of the camera. Viewers will feel that they are in the privacy of the studios of artists, watching as they work. I am grateful to all of them and the Central Institute of Indian Languages, as this documentary is first of its kind.Amshan Kumar has produced around twenty documentaries. They include ‘Bharathi,’ ‘U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer,’ ‘Dr. C.V. Raman,’ ‘Ashokamitran,’ ‘Badal Sircar’s Third Theatre,’ ‘Mangroves,’ ‘Tamil Theatre,’ and ‘Village Knowledge Centres’ among others. He made a feature film ‘Oruthi’ based on Ki. Rajanarayanan’s story ‘Kidai’ This was shown in Indian panorama and won an award, too.

908,The salt stories,RANA SIDDIQUI ZAMAN,2010-05-06,17:08:15 IST,"V. Karthik and Sujatha Shankar Prasad
  While a few students are seen lost in their studies in the silent library room of the American Centre, it's off colour walls with a few aqua blue and mostly black and white photographs attract attention with a silence of another kind — the silence which a city-bred commoner probably didn't even care to listen to. Sometimes a picture doesn't need words to explain its content, but in the case of these photographs, words lend them a fairytale air, turning them into legends. It also draws attention to the most utilised, yet the most ignored ingredient in a household — salt.Two photographers, Chicago-based Sujatha Shankar Prasad and Chennai-based V. Karthik, chose to tell the tale of salt making from the mines at Marakkanam on the outskirts of Puducherry. Photographs detailing the process of natural salt making in the sun, as well as those of Chicago River reflecting images of the Chicago skyscrapers form this exhibition titled “Barking Tree and other places: Mythologies in the Landscape” at The American Centre.Says Karthik, “The salt mines at Puducherry play a very symbolic role for me — of free human spirit and Mahatma Gandhi. If you see these vast seascapes in summers, you will not find any human activity there. From morning to evening, salt gathers at the shores and the sun crystallises it, forming numerous, shining, uniform mounds. Landscape is hardly visible as salt forms the backwaters of the sea. Human activity happens much later when a huge mountain of salt gets naturally prepared and people from villages come to collect it. This is their only source of sustenance. And in my lab, every day I work with this water, light, shade and brightness. I could relate to the natural process.”
Interesting shots
Both Sujatha and Karthik took several interesting shots of the salt making process and the former has woven them into heart-warming tales. For instance, in a picture, an alert dog is seen sitting near a mountain of salt, almost guarding it, and a tree in the shape of a dog is called barking tree. A third picture shows a woman with a basket of salt heading homewards. Sujatha weaves them with a beautiful story that touches your heart.The prints are achieved using a traditional method no longer utilised. “Marakkanam are primarily black and white prints on fibre using traditional photographic methods from 35mm T max negative film. Tonal processes have also been explored in the colour prints for the Chicago River series, which were originally shot on Ilford XP2, a monochromatic film with a chromomeric base,” says Karthik.Says Sujatha, “In 1995 I took shots of the Chicago River on 35 mm and kept their negatives for ages. But as I wanted to take pictures out of them, they had lost quality. That's what brought me to V. Karthik in Chennai, who works in conservation and traditional photography.”The show continues till May 21.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/The-salt-stories/article16298769.ece
909,In myriad moods,K. Rajan,2010-05-06,16:13:44 IST,"Open to interpretation Rajan
  That artists should not imitate is Shilpi Rajan's motto. Therefore following a set of prescribed rules is, naturally, quite unthinkable for the renowned artist.“I never repeat my works,” quipped Rajan as he pointed out his sculptures, which were on display at the Kerala Lalitakala Akademi in Thrissur from April 28 to May 4. And true to his word, each of the 64 sculptures on show at the exhibition titled ‘Kalkkathal,' was unique. This was Rajan's 11th solo exhibition since he started sculpting back in 1984.
Self-taught artiste
The self-taught sculptor revels at depicting varying moods in the same sculpture. “Perhaps it is because I do not complete a sculpture at a stretch.“Although gloom would appear to be the dominant mood,the sculptures actually reflect my mood at that particular point of time when I worked on them,” explained Rajan.“As in life, a sculpture too cannot bear a permanent mood,” he added.What strikes one the most is the influence of folk culture in the sculptures. His human figurines bear clear traces of folk and tribal deities found in the State.Perhaps it is because the artist cannot escape the social milieu in which he grew up. As such, Rajan leaves behind a touch of his identity and originality even in his commissioned works.A wooden sculpture depicting Parvati and Ganapati and one of Koodiyattam maestro Chahchu Chakyar in granite are examples.Of the sculptures that were exhibited, 13 were in granite and four in laterite. None of them has been given a name. “The meaning of a sculpture cannot be contained in a name. It is for the viewer to interpret the meanings for themselves,” said the artist. There is one work though that is special to him, he said.It is a long wooden piece that depicts elephants huddled together, each standing on another and with a woman at the top. The message conveyed is that elephants are so gentle that they can be managed even by one woman.“It also signifies the inter-relationship between animals and nature,” he said.An eye that is not shaped well or a lip that is not in place does not seem to faze the artist and he appears not to be unduly worried about sticking to the norms of sculpting. Studying the sculptures of others, he said, was not of any value to him.“I feel that sculpture should not be taught. Rather, it should be developed in the course of one's own practice of the art,” said Rajan.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/In-myriad-moods/article16298757.ece

  | Photo Credit: Ajit Solanki India figures among the world’s worst 10 countries causing environmental damage, according to a new study which lists Brazil as the most polluting country.The research led by professor Corey Bradshaw, of the University of Adelaide's environment institute, has placed India at seventh position while ranking the U.S. and China as the largest carbon producers after Brazil.The 10 countries with the worst global footprint were Brazil, the US, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru, it said.Countries were measured on a range of indicators, including fertiliser use, natural forest loss, habitat conservation, fisheries and other marine captures, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat.The study, published in the science journal PLoS ONE Wednesday, found Australia's carbon emissions, rate of species threat and natural forest loss were the greatest contributors to its ninth-place ranking, according to The Age.“If you're clearing a lot of forests, you tend to also to overharvest in the ocean and use a lot of fertilisers,” Mr. Bradshaw said explaining the link between development and environmental damage.Mr. Bradshaw said finding the US and China in the top 10 were not surprising, though he was surprised that a relatively poor country such as Brazil took out the top spot.“The wealthier you are, the more damage you do, on average,” he said. “It's just a function of human nature. Growth is the be-all and end-all for all economies around the world, and if you're not growing economically, you're stagnant, and therefore that's a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that's unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Mr. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Mr. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Mr. Bradshaw said the better-ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven't wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we'd consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/India-among-the-worst-10-polluters-Study/article16298793.ece

With awesome prototypes governing the proscenium, the dancers moved onto a Manasi Varnam penned and choreographed by Lalitha Srinivasan pivoting around the pranks of Lord Krishna, the Geetopodesham episode with a musical composition by the late H.K. Narayana.Ajay Vishwanath, one of the seniormost students executed his metaphor brilliantly in the said piece. “Nritya Karnataka” concluded with a ragamalika tillana set to aditala aesthetically performed by the dancers executing square, circle to form the Sri Chakra concept.The Sufiana Kathak under the leadership of Rani Khanam from New Delhi followed next. With the dancer seemingly self-conscious, she tried hard to do justice to the items that she performed. The tihayis, the anahat and the concluding “Mohae apnae rang de rangilae” composed by Hazrat Amir Khusru in the 13th Century deserves special mention for their accomplishment in high aesthetic order. Bharat Natyam thematic duet by P. Praveen Kumar and Soundarya Srivatsa was brilliant. With the kritis, the javalis and the ashtapadis being intertwined into a thematic production “Shringara Lahiri” set to ragamalika and talamalika sung aesthetically by Srivatsa was a real treat to watch. Both the dancers proved their mettle in this evocative rendition.The plot complimented with Soundarya being mesmerised with the flute of Lord Krishna and Praveen in the limelight executing the advent of the Lord with an awesome amalgamation of jathis; it was executed flawlessly. With a peacock's feather as an imagery, Praveen with Soundarya as Radha complimented each other brilliantly on the stage. The “Radhae Brindavana Nilayae” set to raga Rithigowla was an outstanding performance. Abhinaya reaches an echelon of superlative when executed most naturally. Praveen and Soundarya's most natural, yet traditional abhinaya won the audience. In “Yahi madhava yahi Keshava” Krishna eventually manages to placate Radha.

What stood out in Meenakshi's performance was the ability to create, communicate and sustain a particular mood without a single wrinkle.Thus the opening number ‘Ananda Natana Prakasham' in Kedaram could draw in the bliss as well as the contemplative nature of the Lord. The next number, a varnam, spotlighted the sringara aspect without losing sight of the divine nature of the beloved. Dhandayudhapani Pillai's ragamalika ‘Samiyai Azhaithodi Vaa' was interpreted as a dialogue where the sakhi's lack of comprehension of Siva's magnificence paved the way for the nayika to enlighten her. The choreography showed attention to detail: for instance, the Ardhanareeswara was depicted by contrasting the fiery locks of Siva with the long braid of the goddess.
Superb stamina
It was obvious that showmanship was a leading criterion here: following what seems to be today' s trend, the adavus for the theermanams were structured so that the artist was always hurtling around the performing space. One hardly got to witness a whole adavu; instead the long, complex patterns with different nadais were offered as incessant combos of different kinetic adavus. While one was full of admiration for the superb stamina and dedication of the artist (given that this is summer), one also wished some moments of calm had been built in.The abhinaya was a different story and there were numerous moments where one got to relish the artistic imagination. In ‘Jaya Jaya Durge', the goddess was revered not just as the vanquisher of demons but also of the evils within us. The contrasting images of raudram and vatsalyam were delivered with panache. Similarly, Meenakshi's involvement in abhinaya gave a lift to the Tamil piece ‘Dikku thereiyada kaatil.'It was in the thillana that the artist revealed her true mettle as the araimandi remained undiluted, the body lines stayed unfrayed as sollu alternated with the lines of the thillana as shudda nritta. The superb orchestral team of vocalist Hariprasad, Jaisri Ramanathan's nattuvangam, Kalaiarasan's violin and Vedakrishnan's mridangam galvanised Meenakshi's dancing to greater heights.The Kapaleeswarar temple resounded with dha dhindhinda… syllables not often heard in the Chennai air. As devotees turned the corner to the mandapam in the temple, the reason became clear. Kaveri Sageder and Sheetal Kolwalkar, disciples of Shama Bhate from Pune, were presenting a Kathak performance for the Vasant Utsav.For their performance, they used recorded music of high quality. The music ranged from the classical to semi-classical, and, in their words, 'world music'. Rather than stick to lengthy delineations of taal and its nuances, the duo chose short pieces with more of abhinaya content. Perhaps this was to ensure that the Chennai citizen got to comprehend Kathak better.
Dynamic rhythm
It was the dynamic rhythm presentation of teen tal that stole the show. The pieces revealed the dancers' competency in footwork and their control. The introductory number ‘Om Nama Shivaya' followed with the elaboration of teen taal was gripping and impressed the audience with some crystal clear footwork. The five inch wide ghunghroos, the slapping sound of the feet on the granite floor and the whirling skirts of Kaveri and Sheetal projected some weighty fare.Here, the two dancers presented the ginti, taatakar and taat which helped display their skill and experience. If one came looking forward to some challenging sawal jawab sessions, one left disappointed. For the rest of the programme turned out to be a collection of songs which although pleasing to the eyes, fell short on substance. While they offered some lively dancing, the really weighty points of the Kathak style were left unexplored.The abhinaya pieces came in quick succession and set a spirited tone. Maestro Bhimsen Joshi's bhajan ‘Krupa sarovar' extolled the compassion of Krishna and the Ganesha stuti rendered by Shankar Mahadevan reflected the creative bent of Lord Siva. But the Mahadev Sutaha became a piece more memorable for the noisy musical effects than the energetic dancing by the duo. The classicism of such features such as the wrist movements and the stylised walk were overshadowed by the light content of the music; sweet to see but powdery as snow. Even if the dancing per se remained undiluted, the end product varied depending on whether the music was classical or not.The tandav stood out for restrained delivery of Siva's synergy. This piece helped the recital stay on an even keel; the destructive and the creative aspects were powerfully projected through mime and pure rhythm. The finale ‘Vande Mataram' was well performed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/High-degree-of-sophistication/article16299937.ece

  Celebrations across the week for World Dance Day (April 29) saw Bharatanatyam star Chitra Visweswaran in a lecture/demonstration concentrate on the communicative strength of classical dance, the evocative snippets by her disciple Vijay Madhavan and Chitra highlighting aspects of rhythm, gesture and word, and how detailing in dance conveys the message to the viewer — thematic concerns like animals, natural beauty, writing, etc., not straying from the world of the young into esoteric poetry.Spic Macay's evening projection at JNU had the legendary Birju Maharaj weave his Kathak spell, the evening tracing, in Maharaj's inimitable way, how rhythm, implicit in every activity of creation, acquires a visual dimension through movement images and vocabulary of rhythm in dance. The earlier half of the evening featured an enthralling Kuchipudi duet by Raja and Radha Reddy, Raja's tandav brilliance in “Adenamma” in Paras portraying Shiva's dance counter-pointed by the lasya lyricism in “Sringara Lahari” in Neelambari, describing the gracious beauty of the Devi. singing by Sai Bhavani sustained the performance despite the absence of Kaushalya Reddy's authoritative nattuvangam. The disciples with daughter Bhavana participating, impressed in nritta exploration. For a welcome change, tarangam was performed to the Natabhairavi composition of Ravi Shankar.
Dance and value
Natya Vriksha's annual observance of the occasion at the IIC saw a vigorous seminar on classical dance and its values to society at large. Asking how one values value, keynote speaker, renowned dancer/choreographer Kumudini Lakhia, spoke of creating values in classical dances which come with inbuilt structure of values. Individual creativity demanded new interpretations, keeping respect for ethics of the form and its aesthetics sacrosanct — intellectual engagement with different sections of society becoming inevitable for dancers today, asking themselves “Why do I dance?” Quoting several philosophers from Kant to Freud, academic Krishna Menon, Associate Professor, LSR College, questioned the importance of art in an unequal society as an assertion of cultural sovereignty and political importance. As soft power appealing to other states, art, unless involved with people, cannot claim strong ownership or association.But can dance with the body (a most wonderful and also most vulnerable instrument) as medium be compared with other art forms while making assessments? With Indian dance history written on the woman's body, society, given all the renaissance, does not place the art form on the highest pedestal, a point emphasised through practical references from a lifelong career in Odissi, by Aruna Mohanty.Calling dance a Yoga which can open windows otherwise permanently shut in human beings, enabling a reinvention and renovation to upgrade skills which have formed traditional wealth of legacies, art commentator and Chairperson of APPAN Shanta Serbjeet Singh pleaded for respecting the likes of our Langas and Manganiyars and adding value to their creativity. Principal, Gargi College, Meera Ramachandran spoke of dance as the amalgam of all arts. Lata Vaidyanathan referred to the challenges of teaching “learning to learn', classical dance adding to the value of different types of intelligences, amidst Bollywood and all other popular culture. Malabika Mitra extolled Creator and the Created, being the same as in Nataraja.
The performances
That the best value is what comes as an irrepressible urge from the dancer's innermost being was shown by Pravat Kumar Swain, who, with his grace with assertive strength, angika exactitude, total immersion of being in the dance, was the find of the evening Young Dancers' Festival. Riveting Odissi by this 23-year-old covered mangalacharan on the Panchabhoota, Varshamisaran portraying the ecstatic response to first rains, and the delightful rhythms built round Konarak Kanthi — with the Thai Nata “Ta hamta hat tat ta” mnemonics of Debaprasad Das' creation woven into the choreography (making the audience sway) — and finally the natya-filled Ramayana passages of Hanuman in Ashokavan meeting Sita to present the choodamani. Wings led by Aruna Mohanty were competently manned with Vijay Kumar Brik (mardala) and Roopak Kumar Parida (vocal) and excellent violin and flute. This Gotipua trained youngster, for several years under Aruna, is a natural, and heralds a new era re-discovering the male body in Odissi.Shloka Vaidyalingam trained by the Reddys, gave a competent Kuchipudi presentation foot-sure in rhythm with fair abhinaya understanding, highlighted through the Ganapati invocation in Gaula, Tiruvottiyur Tyagiah varnam in Kedaram “Saami Nee Rammanave” with sringar interspersed with the rhythmic virtuosity of jatis led by Kaushalya's nattuvangam, and tarangam in Arabhi.Sneha Chakradhar's assertive Bharatanatyam with excellent rhythmic understanding (evident right from the alarippu in Tisram with mnemonics differently arranged from the conventional) and the Poorvikalyani Dandayudapani varnam “Saamiyai vara solladi”, was creditable for proven familiarity with the text from one not born to the languages of South India, barring words like “Bhoomi-pugazhum, and Kallatanam” which needed more elaboration.But while Nadanamadinar in Vasanta visualising the magnificence of the dancing Nataraja was fine in tone, the varnam, in the nayika's persuasion of the sakhi to carry her message of love to Kartikeya, would have shone more with some soft and more lyrical touches, contrasting the power. Geeta Chandran's nattuvangam added a special high point to the competent musical effort.Disciple of Malabika Mitra, Saurav Roy is a trained dancer. But too much speed in the Teen tal drut passages made flailing of hands sans aesthetics and sharp focus in movement.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/Value-creation-in-Indian-dance/article16298772.ece

  A Bharatanatyam recital by Keerthi Panicker caught the attention of rasikas at Vyloppilly Samskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram, for the youthful exuberance of the artiste. This up-and-coming artiste is a senior disciple of the Dhananjayans of Barathakalanjali, Chennai. All the items in her recital were choreographed by her gurus themselves.Keerthi began with a Ganapathi stuthi, a composition by Karaikudi R. Krishnamurthy. She moved on to another beautiful piece in praise of Lord Nataraja in raga Lathangi, set to Adi tala. Keerthi maintained an elegant approach in her presentation of this joyful dance, which according to myth, the Lord in Chidambaram performed at the request of the saints.Keerthi then took up ‘Nritypahaaram' varnam ‘Bhaavayami Reghuraama' by Semmangudi Sreenivasa Iyer. The piece, a summary of the Ramayana, was perfect in Keerthi's hands. Her movements and striking turnings had a scintillating flow and the whole story was conveyed with élan.Following this Keerthi essayed two challenging presentations portraying two totally different emotions of nayikas. ‘Netranthi neerathile,' is a padam in raga Lathangi that portrays the nayika's fury towards Lord Murugan, whom she sees at the river bank in the company of other women. Keerthi depicted the ‘khandita' nayika in this piece, which ends with the efforts of the nayika trying to convince her beloved to come back to her.The next piece in ragamalika is about a nayika (Radha) who is despondent over the ‘viraha' (separation) from Lord Krishna, and the nayika's conversation with her sakhi. Radha tries to draw a picture of Lord Krishna only to find that she cannot recollect his face.
Excellent depiction
These two absolute abhinaya pieces demand a lot of facial expressions and Keerthi has skilfully transported the theme to the highest level thanks to her excellent training. Her control over abhinaya in the two padams was absolute.Keerthi concluded her recital with a tillana in raga Behag. Also included in the programme was a thematic representation of a prayer to Lord Guruvayurappan by artistes from Bharathakalanjali.Keerthi was accompanied by Santha Dhananjayan on the nattuvangam.

He is a goal scorer. So he is our Wayne Rooney, I guess,” Horner said, comparing Vettel with the Manchester United and England striker Rooney.“I think Sebastian is the driver to beat in the championship at the moment. He is the driver in the best form with arguably the fastest car.”Asked to what characterises Vettel as a forthcoming champion, Horner said: “Number One is speed. Number two is intelligence and number three his personality. These are three major attributes that he has.“He is very straightforward. He is a very pleasant guy to deal with. He is a very intelligent driver. He knows what he wants from the car. He has a very good feeling for the car combined with a lot of natural talent. He is obviously very hungry and he is a big motivation within the team.”Vettel, 22, was runner-up to Jenson Button in 2009 championship and currently lies fifth in the championship with 45 points from four races, 15 behind the leader Button. The German won the Singapore GP but was stopped in leading position it the opening races in Bahrain and Australia by technical problems.“We have a very good car. In the first two races, Sebastian was in the position to win. If there were not the issues on Sebastians car he would have won the first two races,” said Horner.Horner named the championship “very, very open with three different winners in the first for races” and said that his team has all but ideal combination of drivers with the youngster Vettel and the experienced Australian Webber, who lies eighth with 28 points.“I think that we do have a very good balance in the team. We have got two guys in very different stages of their career. We have got a young, very hungry driver and a driver who is much more experienced.“It is a very healthy balance.

  Formula One fans seem to have lost interest in Michael Schumacher and favour Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher’s former manager said in an interview published on Thursday.However, the ex-manager Willi Weber also warned against writing off record world champion Schumacher, who is struggling in his comeback season from a three-year hiatus.Replaced by former spokeswoman Sabine Kehm as manager, Weber is still responsible for Schumacher’s merchandising and told Bild daily that sales are from those of the past.“Sales are not how I expected them to be. There is a certain Schumi-tiredness. The people are saying: my god, where is he driving? You only know him as a winner,” Weber told Bild.“In the past the tribunes were full of Ferrari caps. Now I can count the silver caps with one hand.” Schumacher won five of his world titles with Ferrari and came out of retirement for Mercedes GP this season on a three-year contract.The 41-year-old has had a modest season so far with just 10 points from four races.Weber said that the Red Bull driver Vettel has filled the void as German top driver.“Wherever I look, Vettel is the new Schumi, he is the number one in the TV ads and on the billboards. Michael has left a void and Sebastian has grown into it, because he has the success and Michael doesn’t have it yet,” Weber said.Weber expects an undisputed victory from Vettel at the next race on Sunday in Spain but is also convinced that Schumacher will rebound in the end and win again, even if it takes until next year.“I suffer with Michael when I see how he was passed down the ranks in China. But he will work until everything fits. If all goes well he will get a race win this season. But don’t write Michael off.

920,Picture of neglect,Suganthy Krishnamachari,2010-05-06,18:13:36 IST,"The Pazhuvettaraiyar temple gopuram in a bad state of repair.
  The Big Temple inspires one with a sense of awe, at its scale, grandeur and magnificence. But if you are looking for understated elegance, head for the Twin temples (Irattai Koil) of Kizhaiyur. These are two early Chola temples of stone, miniscule in comparison with the Big Temple, but enchanting, nevertheless. From inscriptions we learn that the temple complex was called Avani Kandarpa Iswara Griham. It was built by a Pazhuvettaraiyar chief, who was a contemporary of Aditya Chola I, and who bore the titles of Avani Gandharvan, Gangamarthandan, Kaliyuganirmoolan, Maravan Maladhalan and Araiyagal Araivuli. The Dwajasthambam was built by yet another Pazhuvettaraiyar- Ranamukharaman.According to S.R. Balasubrahmanyam, the earliest inscription in the temple complex, is of the 13th regnal year of Aditya Chola. But there are those who believe that this inscription is of a later period. This inscription records a gift for burning a perpetual lamp in the two shrines, under the orders of Nakkan Pazhuvettaraiyan Kumaran Kandan. Many other Pazhuvettaraiyars are mentioned in inscriptions in the two temples, and are also referred to as Maravar, Vadugar and Kaikkolar.(For admirers of writer Kalki, the name Pazhuvettaraiyar would have a special connotation. ‘Ponniyin Selvan' bristles with intrigue and vengeance, the Pazhuvettaraiyar Brothers behind all the trechery.)Inscriptions in the villages of Kizhapazhuvur and Melapazhuvur, which are just a few miles from Kizhaiyur, also talk of the Pazhuvettaraiyars. An inscription of the 12th regnal year of Parantaka I, seen in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple in Kizhappazhuvur, talks of the victory won by Pazhuvettaraiyar Kandan Amudanar, over the Pandyas, and their Ceylonese ally, at the battle of Vellin, in which the Pandya king lost his life. To commemorate this victory, the commander Nakkan Sathan made a gift for a perpetual lamp in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple.But who were the Pazhuvettaraiyars? Their origin seems somewhat of a mystery. The Anbil plates of Sundara Chola mention one of Parantaka I's queens as the daughter of “the Kerala King, who was called Pazhuvettaraiyar.” So were the Pazhuvettaraiyars from the Chera kingdom?The deity in the Kizhapazhuvur temple, has been sung of by Gnanasambandar, in the second Thirumurai, 34th padhigam. Verses four and eleven explicitly state that Malayali Brahmins were the priests in the Vadamulanatha (Alandurai Mahadeva) temple. Thevaram scholar Dr. R. Narayanan says, “In the Dharmapuram adheenam publication, the word ‘maraiyaalar' in verse five, meaning Vedic scholars, is also interpreted as ‘Malayali Brahmins.'” Thus although there was a Malayali presence in the Pazhuvur region, there is no conclusive proof that the Pazhuvettaraiyars were of Chera origin.The twin temples of Kizhaiyur, however, have not been sung of in the Thevaram. The Southern shrine in the Kizhaiyur temple complex is referred to in inscriptions as Thenvayil Sri Koil. An inscription of the time of Rajendra Chola says that two persons guilty of homicide had to surrender their land to the Kizhaiyur temple. Another inscription also of Rajendra I's time shows that provision was made for paying a ‘nattuvakkani'- dance master.The twin temples are West facing, and Umapathy sthapati says that it can be inferred from this that the temples were built for a special purpose. If there was a threat from an enemy, or if there were internecine quarrels in a community, or if there had been a famine, then a West facing temple would be built. This is true of both Vaishnava and Siva temples.Another early Chola temple complex is the one at Moovar Koil, but the difference is that in Moovar Koil, both the temples have the same type of sikhara. But in Kizhaiyur, the Southern shrine has a square sikhara, while the smaller northern shrine of Choleeswaram (now called Arunchaleswaram), has a round sikhara.Umapathy explains that whether it is a Siva temple, or a Vishnu temple, the sikhara and pattern of the temple will depend on the type of idol to be installed. If it is a Vishnu temple, then construction will be according to whether the idol is to be sayana, asana,or sthanaka. If it is a representation of a vibhava avatara like Trivikrama, then the rules of iconometry will be different, and the temple pattern will also be different.In the case of a Siva temple, one could have Nagara (square), Dravida (octagonal) or Vesara (circular) sikhara depending upon the Linga chosen. Usually, the sikhara will have to be in the same category as the Linga. Thus if a Nagara linga is decided upon, then the sikhara will also be Nagara.The idol of the Nandi facing the garba griha in the Southern shrine, looks reposeful. The folds of the skin at the neck make it look so lifelike, that one is almost tempted to touch it to make sure it is indeed a stone sculpture and not a real bull!
Brimming with energy
In the mukhamantapa, we find lion pillars. The lions seem to brim with energy, ready to spring on you. In the Vedas, the lion represents energy and the elephant beauty, explains Veezhinathan sthapati. Only animals and birds mentioned in the Vedas such as peacocks, swans, elephants etc. would find a place in temples, he says.Outside the sanctum sanctorum are four pillars, the tops of which can be made to rotate, according to a villager. He rues the fact that while until a few years ago, the tops of all four would rotate, now only one does. It was common for sculptors to display their skills by sculpting such pillars or by making a sphere in a yazhi's mouth rotate.In the mukhamantapa, is a beautiful sculpture of Siva and Parvati, which, unfortunately, is covered with oil, soot and grime. How can devotees be allowed to light lamps so close to the sculptures? There is yet another Nandi in a corner of the mukhamantapa. It is not clear where this came from.The northern shrine is also a two-tiered one, like the southern shrine. An inscription here shows that one of Raja Raja I's queens belonged to the Pazhuvettaraiyar clan. The inscription, of the 27th regnal year of Raja Raja, says that upon the request of his queen Nakkan Panchavan Mahadevi, the daughter of Avani Kandarpa Purattu Devanar of Pazhuvur, the king granted income from newly surveyed lands to the temple. The outer walls of both shrines have sculptures of Dakshinamurthy, Subrahmanya, and Brahma. Devotees have fixed huge bindis of vermilion and sandal on these sculptures.The vermilion powder might contain corrosive substances, which could damage the sculptures. But who is to make sure that devotees don't deface sculptures, in a temple that is unattended? Should a monument of this kind not have a guard?The brick and mortar gopuram of the complex is in a bad state, with plants growing on it. The yard is ill lit, and presents an unswept look, with bushes here and there. A board put up by the State Archaeology department lies uncared for on the ground. There is a ‘volunteer' priest, who doesn't seem to know much about conservation. It is a sad commentary on the regard we have for our treasures, when even a protected monument is in such a state of neglect.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/Picture-of-neglect/article16298790.ece

Chandrasekaran also feels: “It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision…” He adds: “My mother imparted a rich visualisation of the world, and got me inclined to the melodic world. When I look back, I feel even with eyesight, I wouldn't have achieved so much…”Chandrasekaran, rewinding to his initial days of hard work and resolve, brought in an overpowering sense of musicality to the conversation and enriched it with spontaneous serenades, explanations and demonstrations. “You have to get a face-to-face feel of my musical personality, only then can you write,” his modest expressions went on unrestrained.Struck by a severe form of jaundice even before he had turned two, his mother Charubala Mohan, a violinist, was forced to take a decision to get his eyes removed to avoid further damage. “My mother showed the nerve and fortitude to go ahead. “That was just the beginning of her determination… before long she learnt Braille and put me on a daily routine of Braille-and-violin-classes everyday,” recalls the violinist who lost his father when he was seven.Born in Kolkata, Chandrasekaran spent his early years in Kanpur, and has lived in Tamil Nadu (Tiruvaiyaru and later Chennai) for the last 65 years. “My mother says I could recognise ragas even as a three-year-old and was constantly humming, which provided a background to her mundane, household chores. It was difficult for me to hold the violin on my leg and use the bow. My mother moved heaven-and-earth for hours together everyday to see me balance the instrument and get the bowing mechanism right, ” recalls Chandrasekaran.Vocal lessons, as a rule, preceded his violin classes. Only after he mastered the sangatis and got the bhava right could he try it on the violin, he says. “You have to sing on the violin,” my mother insisted “and years later I realised that it had helped me bring clarity in my expressions.” Vocal music too became a significant constituent of his presentations and as a 11-year-old, he had already stepped on to the stage. In 1950, he received the Best Violinist Award (as a 13-year-old) from the Music Academy in Chennai. He continued his vocal lessons under Mannargudi Sambasiva Bhagavatar and Kumbakonam Vishwanatha Iyer. Later, he was trained in padam rendering by Vidyala Narasimha Naidu and even today he renders padam and javalis along with his daughter for Bharatanatya recitals, the recent ones being their Cleveland Festival performances.“It was during my growing up years that my mother often took me to the sacred festivities in temples and that's where my senses opened up to the sublime “Yadukula Kambodhi” and Gambheeranatte raga on nadaswara.” Chandrasekaran's Todi on the National Programme of AIR came in for appreciation by nadaswara vidwans of the late 1950s and the manner in which he essayed Kadanakuthoohala had Rajaratnam Pillai comment: “This hand is going to play lakhs of krithis.” Consciously, he was taken to the nadaswara style and the unique chemistry of the wind-instrument was also evident in his playing. The amalgam was palpable vidwans T.Chowdiah, Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu would often notice this.Chandrasekharan has accompanied an entire gamut of stalwarts from old-timers Ariyakudi, Maharajapuram Vishwanatha Iyer, GNB, Madurai Mani, flute Mahalingam to Dr. Balamurali Krishna, N. Ramani and the reigning stars of today. His solo performances termed ‘voco-violin' (with vocal renderings) have come in for appreciation although the master thinks, “accompanying has its challenges,” as he is known for his ‘deep shadow-follow' of the main artistes which requires a different mindset. And this painstaking focus has helped him deal with absolutely teasing pallavis, as also the age-old avadhana-pallavi set to more than one tala and simultaneously at that.Titles and honours run into several paragraphs for Chandrasekaran that include the Sangeetha Kalanidhi and the Sangeeth Natak Academy award and his profound gratitude to his mother has him running the ‘Charubala Mohan Trust' that honours music vidwans and conducts music programmes.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/The-song-paved-the-way/article16298846.ece

Manjunath (mridanga) in Bangalore.The performance, devoted entirely to the compositions of Muthuswami Dikshithar, included krithis in some rare ragas, the arohana, avarohana, and salient features of which were demonstrated lucidly, and handled with admirable felicity and finesse by the young vocalist. The opening number, “Kanakambari Karunyamrithalahari” in Kanakambari raga and tishra ekatala, was adorned with brief kalpana swaras highlighting the vivadi characteristics and jaru glides of the nishada and gandhara.“Mangalambayai Namasthe” in Malavasri raga and jhampa thala, beginning with the swarakshara ‘ma' in the tara sthayi was instantly arresting, and was followed by the beautiful krithi “Kumaraswaminam” in Asaveri.Sumadyuthi, generally equated with Simhendramadhyamam, was taken up for a short alapana that threw its unique identity and distinct ‘pa dha sa' usage into sharp focus. “Pamarajanapalini” was rendered with a few avartanas of kalpana swaras. The main raga of the evening, Shankarabharanam, was elaborated in a series of soft, mellifluous sancharas that combined spontaneity with technical virtuosity. “Akshayalinga Vibho” in mishra chapu thala featured an excellent neraval and kalpana swaras suffused with raga bhava at “Badarivana”, and was succeeded by a tani avarthana. The concluding item was “Sri Kamalambike Sive Pahimam” in Sri raga.The mellow majesty of the compositions and the uniformly sedate tempo maintained throughout, generated an effect that was different from that of the usual concert format in vogue. The accompanying artistes sustained and accentuated the underlying tenor of the recital with expert and appropriate responses. According to vocalist G. Ravi Kiran, the driving force behind Guruguhaamrta, the aim is “to preserve and propagate the singing of Dikshithar's compositions” through a series of concerts and lecture demonstrations, the material for which is sourced primarily from the “Sangeetha Sampradaya Pradarshini” of Subbarama Dikshithar.Along with clarifications about the musical form, explanations of the lyrics and their spiritual significance, and of literary embellishments such as rhyme, alliteration and assonance, and deployment of yathis and madhyamakala sahitya, which are integral components of the compositions, will definitely lead discerning listeners to higher levels of enjoyment and edification.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Rare-gems/article16298845.ece

  Kasturi Rangan's forceful and deep voice with waves of rolling akara conferred classical weight on his exposition in Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samiti's Bahula Panchami concert. Raga alapanas provided solid experience occasionally with excess vocalisation. Sancharas, deeply reflective, focussed on highlighting the radiance of the ragas, Sankarabharanam and earlier Pantuvarali.He freely let his voice unfold his manodharma and formulated its progress in vidwat idiom. With spells of inspiration, his talent combined smoothness of music's flow with the chaste characteristics of classicism. This lofty approach and relevant technique indicated the lines of his grooming.Melodic majesty was his prized performing base. This could be sensed in the many variations in negotiating the tara sthayi segment. This to a great extent explained the pulsating pleasantness.
Impressive and creative
Sankarabharanam (‘Yaduta Nilachite') provided the core of the recital. Kasturi Rangan's creativity couched in elegant twists and turns counted for its impressiveness. Vocal immensity exerted its influence on providing Sankarabharanam's panoramic edifice. A major part of development explored many levels of the raga's reach. The phrasings documented the moorchana boundaries and the akara-packed raga complex was gradually presented.The interpretative method well communicated the loveliness of the kirtana. The flow of the sangatis was set against the grandeur of the piece. It hit the right aesthetic areas, a method imbibed from his guru Seshagopalan's style. It would do him much good to convert imitation to emulation and observe restraint for artistic effect. The first taste of the concert at the start, the Aarabhi Pancharatnam ‘Saadinchane' whetted the appetite for the rest of the songs — ‘Sangita Gnanamu' (Dhanyasi), ‘Evarikai' (Devamanohari) and ‘Dunmarga' (Ranjani). The rendering of the kirtanas in general drew strength from exuberance packed in them.While overall the singing represented Carnatic flavour, Kasturi Rangan's Pantuvarali alapana was in the ustad mode. The kirtana was ‘Appa Rama Bhakti.' It was not a single factor that ensured the brilliance of the programme. Voice, talent, guru's influence and steadfastness combined to project Carnatic solidarity.As against the thrustful approach of the vocalist, V.V. Srinivasa Rao, on the violin, softly textured the ragas Sankarabharanam and Pantuvarali in his solo sessions. His play incorporated gentle touches to the sancharas and the economy in building Sankarabharanam was noteworthy, stressing the essence concerted more than elaboration. It was a very respectable face of Sankarabharanam that he delineated.Mannarkoil Balaji's mridangam revealed a style of play wedded to laya substance. There was, good balance between expertise and efficiency, in his thani.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Chaste-rendition/article16299693.ece

  A month-long festival of dance and music was held at Venkitachalapathy Temple, Kumarapuram, Palakkad in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam celebration at the temple. The festival was a fine blend of performances by renowned as well as up-and-coming musicians.
Kanjhangad Sankaran Namboothiri's concert was mellifluous. The Carnatic vocalist was accompanied by Subbaraman (violin) and Mahesh Kumar (mridangam).He wooed the audience with the Adi tala varnam piece ‘Neranammithi' in Kannada. His rendition of an alapana of Lalitha was scholarly. Then came Subhapanthuvarali and the Tyagaraja kriti ‘Ennaalluage.' ‘Ennaalluage' had a niraval at ‘Konnalu sakethapuravasa…' Clear diction and apt gamakas had the audience captivated during this piece. Mahesh Kumar brought the feel of this kriti alive on his mridangam. Namboothiri then took ‘Saragunapalimpa' in Kedaragowla for detailed exposition. It was laced with creative swarakalpana, which paved the way to a brilliant tani.
Sublime renditions

Cherthala K.N. Ranganatha Sharma's recital captured the attention of music buffs with his sublime renditions that adhered to tradition. Cherthala Sivakumar (violin), Kumarapuram Hariharalakshmanan (mridangam) and Deepu (ghatam) accompanied the vocalist. Gifted with a resonant voice, Sarma's concert was marked for his emphasis on clear diction. He began his concert with a composition by Lalgudi Jayaraman – ‘Neeve gatiyani' in Nalinakanthi (Adi tala). This was followed by Papanasam Sivan's ‘Thathvamariyatharama' in Reethigowla and the rarely heard Bhagavatar's ‘Saranam Vijayasaraswathimaye' in the raga Vijayasaraswathi. ‘Saranam…' had a scholarly swaraprasthara.An alapana of Poorvikalyani, ‘Thillai Chidambaram,' was laced with brilliant manodharmaswara. Dikshithar's ‘Sreevenkatagireesamalokaye' breathed an air of bhakthi to the concert. A rendition of Tyagaraja's ‘Swararagasudharasa' had a well articulated niraval at ‘Mooladharaja…' This was followed by an impressive tani.
N.J. Nandini, a promising young artiste captivated the audience during her concert with her vocal range and aesthetic modulations that reminded the audience of her guru Bombay Jayasree. Thiruvizha Viju S. Anand (violin), A. Ganesan (mridangam) and Vivek (ghatam) accompanied Nandini.She started the concert with ‘Vanajakshi' in Kalyani. Dikshitar's ‘Sreemahaganapathiravathuma' in Gowla came next. Pattanam's ‘Mariveredikkevarayya' in Shanmukhapriya was ornamented with fast paced niraval amd swarprasthara at ‘Sannuthangasree.'A well-rendered ‘Sreerangappuravihara' and ‘Ninnujappakarana' were ensued by a neat portrayal of Kedaragowla. ‘Saragunapalimpa' was marked by clear sangathis. A complex ragam-tanam-pallavi in Bhairavi ‘Avan en sonthamadi, Govindanadi, Mukunthanadi' and a lively swarakalpana was followed by a superb tani.
Rajeswari Satish, a disciple of maestros M.A. Venugopal, C.S. Krishnayyar and P.S. Narayanaswami took the stage captivating connoisseurs with her pleasing stage presence and crystal-clear padanthara. Sampath (violin), Anilkumar (mridangam) and Dipu (ghatom) accompanied her. She began her concert with ‘Valachvachi' in Navaragamalikavarna that was sung in two speeds and followed by manodharmaswaras. Rajeswari dedicated the song ‘Tharumo nin karunakataksham' to Krishnayyar; a song that he himself composed in Saranga. A charming ‘Ninnenammithinayya' in Simhendramadhyamam was followed by the highlight of the evening, a sparkling Bhairavi. Dikshitar's ‘Balagopala' was ornamented with a niraval at ‘Neelaneeradasareera…' Cascading swarasanchara was followed by a brilliant tani.A performance by flautist K.S. Gopalakrishnan with T.H. Subrahmaniam (violin), Surendran (mridangam) and Guruprasanna (ganjira) was memorable. Gopalakrishnan began the concert with an Adi tala varnam in Darbar ‘Chalamela.' Dikshitar's ‘Mahaganapathim' in Natta had dazzling swaraprasthara. The violinist who was in tune with the flautist added allure to the concert. A crisp rendition of ‘Nadathanumanisam' in Chithranjani was followed by a leisurely alapana of Hindolam, ‘Govardhanagiresam.' It was laced with scintillating swara passages.The highlight of the concert was the luxurious treatment of Thodi. Short and crisp phrases and alternate playing between the flautist and violinist delighted the audience. A lively tani preceded a well-articulated niraval and swarasanchara. Gopalakrishnan wound up his concert with ‘Bhagyadalakshmi baramma' of Purantharadasa in Madhyamavathi.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Fine-blend-of-ragas/article16299075.ece

  | Photo Credit: N_SRIDHARAN Shantanu Bhattacharya's concert captured moments, where one could savour his guru. His performance included the repertoire of his first guru Prasun Bannerji, and had the makings of a scintillating session with Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty , in the great style of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Sahib. Shantanu performed with exuberance the challenging intricacies of the Patiala Gharana.The morning at the Little Play Coop began with the melodic strains of ‘Gunkali' in vilambit, madhya and dhrut laya, where the last piece , “Gao Gunkali Gunijan Mein Gao” showcased a wide variety in expression and technique.
Distinctive alaps
Miyan ki Todi was full of distinctive alaps, which spilled into three-four avartans in full meend and uchhals.He touched the higher notes, lacing them with bol-alaps and created a melody substantiating the raga in a great tradition. The taan patterns were varied and spectacular, restating and redefining the heights that an Ustad usually reaches. In short, Shantanu's performance was a picture-perfect recital reminiscent of his great musical lineage.The second half of the concert was an interactive session, during which Shantanu took ragas with similar swaras but with varying moods such as Jaunpuri and Darbari; Bihag and Maru Bihag; Multani and Miyan ki Todi and Bhopali and Deshkar. He spoke about the strong correlation between the time of the enunciation of the raga and its swaras- a correlation, he pointed out, that actually helped to unfurl a particular raga.For example in the raga Miyan ki Malhar, the combination of ‘ni dha ni sa' dramatises and denotes the coming of clouds. He also felt that Bahar cannot be sung, unless it is Spring and that Bhairav can never be performed in the evening. He also pointed out that occasionally, the composition hailed the ragas. Finally with the coming of Bhairavi, Shantanu demonstrated how all the thaats with their scales can be derived by shifting scales by one note.The two beautiful compositions from Bhairavi finally established that Shantanu had scaled great heights and finally would cement his place among India's top singers. On the tabla was Debashish, a prolific master of his genre and the two complimented each other perfectly.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Recital-upholds-musical-lineage/article16298787.ece

Umayalpuram Sivaraman mentioned that “Pramanam” meant taking an oath of allegiance and Vedavalli was an authority on many aspects of music. He also appreciated her boldness and was all praise for the way Vedavalli had prepared her disciples to make them render these kritis in its pristine form.Krishna wished that this disc had seen the light of the day some 30 years ago and cautioned against the loose manner in which the word Sampradaya was being used, in discussing issues. He called the album an authentic document, which should be listened to frequently to gain familiarity. He requested Vedavalli to continue to release such CDs for the benefit of both musicians and rasikas.In response, Vedavalli said that the CD was an attempt to preserve a 150-year old tradition and that she was not compelling anyone to follow the bhani.Mala Mohan of Swathy Soft Solutions and Sumathi Krishnan, a senior disciple of Vedavalli also narrated the pleasant learning experiences they underwent while getting this CD to its present form. Smt. Pankajavalli read out a “Vazhthuppaa” as a tribute to Vedavalli. The event was efficiently compered by Shivapriya, Vedavalli’s disciple.There was a soulful rendering of some of the kritis by Sumithra Vasudev, Malini and Sumathi Krishnan to the accompaniment of Ram on the mridangam, prior to the commencement of this function.

927,First lady of nagaswaram,V. BALASUBRAMANIAN,2010-05-06,17:51:15 IST,"Nagaswara vidwan Madurai Ponnuthai in Madurai. Photo: S. James
  | Photo Credit: S_James. It is the third day of the Chithirai Brahmotsavam (Chithirai Peruvizha) of the Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. The simmering heat not withstanding, the milling crowd heads towards the temple and the asthana nagaswara vidwans are getting ready for their concerts. After the darshan, we set out to meet the octogenarian nagaswaram vidushi Madurai M.S. Ponnuthayi, once a regular at the temple festivals.Today, living on a paltry pension of Rs.1,000 and supported by her only son, this first lady of nagaswaram, who was once a sought after musician within the State and without, has turned philosophical and accepts life as it comes.Though she belonged to a family of musicians well versed in the flute, the violin and the mridangam, her father decided to train her in nagaswaram. Shifting base from their native village Ayakkudi near the Palani Hills, to Madurai, Ponnuthayi came under the tutelage of Madurai Natesa Pillai. The veteran recalls, “Classes would begin in the morning and would go on for hours. In fact, my guru was criticised for teaching a tiny girl.” The instrument requires plenty of lung power and energy to produce sound in a sustained manner for several hours. Hence, the nagaswaram was dominated by male players.
Rigorous practice
After classes, practice at home went on for hours. “These hours and hours of practice helped me overcome the initial struggle of even producing a note. My arangetram was in the 1940s. A huge crowd had gathered curious to see who the nine-year old girl playing the nagaswaram was, which hitherto was considered a male bastion. Soon the word spread and I was called to play as a supporting artist for many leading vidwans. Concerts with T.N. Rajaratnam Pillai, Tiruvengattaar and Tiruveezhimizhalaiyar are still etched in memory. I was just in my teens then!” Ponnuthayi has even played in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.“I played for AIR Tiruchi first in 1946 and this went on till about 1989. This helped a lot in my name spreading faster. Offers to play at temple festivals and marriage functions started pouring in. Naturally, I formed my own group comprising support nagaswaram, thavil players and talam. It was support from temples that helped sustain us. Getting noticed at such festivals earned us opportunities to play in marriages. I was never bogged down by the taxing schedules of temple processions which went on for 12 hours at times! As if to prove a point against my detractors, I withstood this strenuous schedule, thanks to the Blessings of the Almighty,” Ponnuthayi remembers and shows us some old photographs of hers with child-like enthusiasm.“My popularity grew beyond Madurai and I started playing elsewhere in the State. Once during a performance in Kerala, I received a medal from the organisers after I was pitted to play against a local nagaswaram player. Mind you, it was an impromptu competition.” She has played continuously for three years in the late 40s in Sabarimalai, as a thanksgiving to Lord Ayyappan, the presiding deity of the temple, whom she believes, saved her life when she was seriously ill during a concert tour of Kerala. She considers her concert at the Second World Tamil Conference a prestigious one.Ponnuthayi has many titles to her credit, the first being ‘Nada Gana Arasi' awarded by the Madurai Tamil Sangam and the last being the Kalaimamani. She values the appreciation of the audience during and after a concert more than titles and awards. “It is those humble words of appreciation that pep up the proceedings for me,” she says.
The master of Thodi
Her favourite ragam and player? “Thodi and TNR,” pat comes the reply. She continues, “Yes there are other ragams that I like but with Thodi, we can go on exploring its depths for hours. Again, TNR was the master of it.”Incidentally, Microsoft has taken a recording of Ponnuthayi's Thodi to be played at its headquarters in the U.S. under the category of Indian Music. Apart from M.S. Subbulakshmi, Ponnuthayi was the only other woman musician from South India to have been featured in an exhibition in Japan several decades ago. “An American girl Karisha King who visited this exhibition came all the way to learn nagaswaram from me for about a year.”Happily married to Madurai Chidambara Mudaliar, she went on to scale greater heights as he encouraged her tremendously. He was a Legislative Council Member for about three years and was part of the Congress party. It was after his passing away in 1972 that her professional life took a downward slide; engagements for playing in weddings abruptly stopped because of the prevalent stigma of a widow playing the mangala vadyam.About music then and now, Ponnuthayi has this to say. “We had to really toil hard to learn a kriti or a ragam. It took several months before we could master them. Today it is vice versa. Everything is available in capsules and is just a click away. Kritis are grasped at a rapid pace and forgotten as quickly.” She demonstrates by singing the Hamsadhwani varnam which she learnt when she was nine. The sruti alignment at this ripe age is something unbelievable.Her grandson Vigneswaran, a mridangam vidwan, has started learning the basics of nagaswaram from her. He teaches music in a local school and heads a group called Madurai Ponnuthayi Isai Alayam that gives Carnatic performances in and around Madurai. Ponnuthayi also teaches music to the locals there. Vigneswaran is planning to start a music school in his grandmother's name to perpetuate both music and Ponnuthayi's name.As Ponnuthayi blows the seevali to pose for photographs, we request her to play. But she politely turns us down saying she is weak. As this writer takes leave of her, he remembers the days when his father would tune in to AIR Tiruchi with difficulty just to listen to late night concerts of Ponnuthayi and make everyone at home listen to her.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/First-lady-of-nagaswaram/article16298782.ece
928,‘An artist is responsible for enhancing music quality',LALITHAA KRISHNAN,2010-05-06,17:31:34 IST,"Letting his deft fingers do the talking as they work magic on the strings, vainika Bonala Sankara Prakash is the walking, strumming proof that hard work pays. His music mirrors a rare blend of technique and aesthetics, strength and tenderness, creativity and accountability within the framework of tradition. The artist shares his thoughts on the present and future of the veena in the cutcheri milieu and the discipline that goes into the making of an artist.

Initial Steps…
I began playing the veena at age of five and gave my first full length concert at 9. My mother Ramani and father Bonala Jagannathan are veena and vocal vidwans. My father, who is my guru, remains my greatest source of inspiration. He imparted the subtleties of sampradaya sangeetham with emphasis on the techniques of veena playing. He was a disciple and close associate of the late Vasa Krishnamurthi, a legendary veena vidwan of the Bobbili tradition, renowned for four centuries. My maternal grandfather, trained in classical music, was also a mridangam artist in the bhajana sampradaya. He ensured that I stayed constantly tuned to musical thought.
Fostering the listening habit…
My father often took me to vocal and instrumental concerts of stalwarts, particularly the annual series in Vishakapatnam. Immersed in music at that impressionable age, I experienced immense joy. Those unforgettable cutcheris have been an everlasting source of inspiration for the contemplation and analysis of the myriad intricacies of melody, rhythm and technique, then and now.
Reaping harvest through sadhana…
Following the example of my father and guru who put in at least 10 hours of practice daily, I followed this schedule diligently for 25 years. Today, this sadhana stands me in good stead. Initiated early into manodharma aspects in a natural and phased manner, I find that its boundless creative scope gives me the highest satisfaction as an artist. Technique is a means to an end. Once command over technique is achieved, the musician tends to devote more time to contemplation. This inner communion leads to manifestation of greater bhava.
Evolving a style…
An artist’s style evolves as the result of years of experience, assimilation and absorption. I work towards an ideal combination of heavy gamakas and ravai sangatis through coordination of right and left movements to realise the maximum potential of the veena as well as sahitya bhava sans unnecessary meetu. This approach has contributed to my handling of ragam, tanam, pallavi and niraval. Singing whatever I learnt before playing it has ensured that my instrumental expression closely shadows the vocal.
Responsibility as an artist…
The celestial timbre (naadam) of the veena strings has filled my waking hours and been my mainstay since childhood. The Saraswathi veena has been revered since ancient times and the vainika aims for closest possible adherence to vocal expression. Every artist carries the responsibility of enhancing the quality of music and the aural experience and garnering greater exposure for quality music. I believe in one putting one’s shoulder to the wheel to produce ennobling music. I leave no stone unturned in this endeavour.
The role of AIR…
As a staff artist, I have received great encouragement from AIR right from the beginning. The awards I won at AIR annual competitions spurred me on to translate my passion into my profession. My participation in South Zone concerts, National Programmes, RTP specials and award-winning musical features such as ‘Ekoham Bhavishyami’ on AIR as well as Doordarshan programmes were enriching experiences. The opportunity of listening up close to AIR concerts of great musicians has been a steady source of inspiration, ideas and insight.
The current scenario with regard to the veena…
Nowadays, few students opt for the veena due to the hard work, late rewards and difficulties involved in portability of the instrument. We need new entrants with the commitment to take it up as a full time profession. While it is heartening to note that some organisations have begun convening veena fests, it would be a fillip to see more vainikas featured in regular concert series. As an artist, I look forward to performing opportunities on a wider platform to create and sustain audience interest.
Performance chart…
In addition to solos, I also give jugalbandhis and have performed with Hindustani musicians such as Purbayan Chatterjee and Janardhan Mitta.
Awards and recognition…
I got the gold medal from the Vishaka Music Academy (1996) and Best Performance award for three consecutive years from Navya Nataka Samithi (1984-86). I have received Sankranthi Puraskar from the Pushpagiri Peetam and to have been honoured as Asthana Vidwan of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam (2008). In 2006, at the request of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams, I tuned devotional songs for the Bhajana Yagna project and conducted the music for 108 songs in an audio release.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/lsquoAn-artist-is-responsible-for-enhancing-music-quality/article16298776.ece
929,Ragas handled with profundity,PVK,2010-05-06,17:09:21 IST,"The composing of thillanas, since the earliest known composer of this musical form Melattur Veerabadriah, has undergone many changes and the last century has seen many vidwans who have made their contributions as composers of thillanas. It would be no exaggeration to state that the art of composing thillanas has reached its zenith with the creations of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Jayaraman's thillanas have gained immense popularity among music lovers, vocal and instrumental performers and have been acclaimed by the traditionalists as well.Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and his sister Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi have presented eight thillanas of their illustrious father in this audio compact disc brought out by Charsur Digital Work Station.The Desh raga thillana is the composer's one of the most popular compositions, probably next to the evergreen Mohanakalyani thillana. The siblings have chosen an appropriate kalapramanam for this opening number and is an apt curtain raiser for the fare which follows.
Clear lyrical content
Great care has been given to the bowing by the violinists while rendering the sahitya portions and the differentiation between the jati syllables and the sahitya are clearly distinguishable. The sahityas do not become an extension of the jatis. The lyrical contents are distinctly clear in the charanam sections.Karnaranjani raga, sporting a tricky Arohanam ‘SRGMGPDS' has a sampoorna Avarohanam ‘SNDPMGRS' (derivative of Kharaharapriya), has been handled with the genius of the composer in the thillana in this raga. It is very sensitively played and does not portray the raga as a mere scale. The melody comes out in full glory and is very engaging.The next number is the adi (tisra nadai) tala set Behag raga thillana which was frequently rendered by M.L. Vasanthakumari in her concerts.Following this are thillanas in Bageshri, Vasanti, Bimplas, Dwijavanti and Madhuvanti. These ragas are very well suited for compositions which serve as tukkadas in a concert. The Vasanti raga thillana is the lengthiest one in this disc and has an eerie opening which suits the melody and warrants a second listening.Perfection has been Lalgudi's hallmark and his offspring live up to this reputation in this disc.The percussionists J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and S. Karthick (ghatam) are seasoned artists and follow the compositions like a shadow. Their playing greatly enhances the listening pleasure.

930,Sketching ragas with ease,G. SWAMINATHAN,2010-05-06,16:48:03 IST,"SWEET VOICES: The Serugudi Sisters.
  The vocal concert of the Serugudi Sisters at Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam was creditable because they included some compositions which are not often heard on concert platforms. A Tamil varnam in Atana provided a zestful start to the proceedings. Tyagaraja's ‘Ninne Bhajana' in Nattai and ‘Graha Balamemi' in Revagupti were pointers to the siblings' interest in projecting the raga images with emphasis on specific sangatis. A few strands of tepid swaras were affixed to the Revagupti kriti.Rema ventured on the elaboration of Rishabhapriya with motifs strong enough to distinguish it from Charukesi. ‘Mahathmule Teliyaleruni' by Mysore Vasudevachar augured well with the dynamism of the kriti adding swara sallies on ‘Mahi Sudha', the anupallavi line. The niraval surfaced only in the Ritigowla kriti of Tyagaraja ‘Chera Ravathe', on ‘Talli Tandri Leni Bala Tana Nathu' with swaras; but here, notwithstanding a melodic raga like Ritigowla, the niraval fell short of emotional aspect.
Well-rehearsed
The core piece was Madhyamavati, which was taken up by Geetha as preface to the Tyagaraja composition ‘Venkatesa Ninnu'. Here the swaras were on the pallavi and moved to the extended kuraippu swara sorties with ‘sadhjam' as the landing note. All swara exchanges in this concert were concluded by both the sisters, with well rehearsed and impressive korvais. On the positive side, the sisters articulate well with full throated expressions. Rationally speaking, they recite well but the missing part is the internalisation of any raga or song which would add charm to the raga, kriti or swara. Well, spontaneity is different from a forced synthetic approach.The fast paced phrases in raga alapana and swara surges can temporarily impress the audience; but it is the evenness in the alapana and how the raga is spread out that will help the performers in the long run. Both Rishabapriya and Madhyamavati were good treatises but offered nothing special or specific to muse or ruminate over later either by the rasika or the singers. This statement holds good for the theoretically correct interpretations of songs sans soul too.With the voices almost identical, sweet and in their control, experience should impart the importance of searching for the spirit and sharing the same with the listener…this is musical wisdom. Hope Rema and Geetha learn this. A few more pleasing kritis were in their kitty; ‘Srihari Vallabhe' in Suddha Dhanyasi by Mysore Vasudevachar, ‘Ranganayakam' in Nayaki by Dikshitar, ‘Manavyala' in Nalinakanti by Tyagaraja and ‘Smarajanaka' in Behag by Swati Thirunal were worth recording.Kovai Chandran more or less presented the raga images in the same style as that of the sisters, offering sound without much soul. Kalakkad R. Srinivasan and Rajaraman on the mridangam and the ghatam provided able support and a tad aggressively framed ‘thani'.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Sketching-ragas-with-ease/article16298754.ece

  Carnatic vocalists Ranjani and Gayatri are among the top artistes on the Carnatic music scene today. As youth icons, they bolster one's confidence in the future of Carnatic music. It was fitting that Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Delhi, honoured them with the title of “Nada Bhushanum” during its annual Tyagaraja festival not long back.Gayatri said the award was a recognition of their hard work and dedicated it to their parents, rasikas and accompanying artistes.Ranjani and Gayatri are known for their melodious and vibrant voices, and their fertile imagination has won them rasikas from across the world.Ranjani takes the lead in sharing her views on the invaluable compositions of the musical Trinity — Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastri. She feels they seem fresh even years after they were composed. “When the audience listens to a kriti, it should make them to sit up and experience the wonder of the raga,” says Ranjani. “As performers we try to bring out the beauty and joy of the raga which is intangible. The listeners should be able relate their feelings with the raga.”Gayatri, bright-eyed, continues: “Without deviation from the traditional system we like to explore new ideas and be innovative in our approach.”Ranjani points out the debt of gratitude she and her sister owe to their parents for their interest in music and tirelessly taking them to concerts when they were young. “It laid a strong foundation. Music is a journey, and we both wish to travel as long as we can.” It was a journey that began with the violin. It was P.S. Narayanaswamy who recommended they give vocal performances, and thus began their metamorphosis from violinists to much sought after vocalists in the Carnatic music world. The duo's effortless singing, especially of vrittams, is a treat for listeners. Their diction and control over raga presentation in the fast tempo speak volumes for their hard work and dedication to maintaining quality. Calling their father a perfectionist, they say they owe their success to him.Gayatri adds, “We have come a long way in vocal performance. What our fingers used to speak, we are expressing vocally. Exposure to Hindustani music has helped us, but music is beyond boundaries. Listening to various forms of music helps a singer, since the good values of music get into your system unconsciously, effortlessly.”Ranjani recollects her teenage years as an accompanist to stalwarts like D.K. Pattamal. They remember her generosity in accepting the child artiste. “The humility and will to make the accompanying artiste comfortable in those days are values we wish to imbibe and cherish,” says Ranjani.Though popular performers, the sisters are cautious of excess. Ranjani says they space out their concert schedule to ensure the health of their vocal chords. “The numbers are not important. We wish to give memorable performances.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Two-to-crescendo/article16299942.ece
932,Tribute to Swati Tirunal,A. Sangameswaran,2010-05-06,16:26:22 IST,"Shreyas Narayanan
  A three-day festival of dance and music dedicated to Swati Tirunal was held at Sree Koodalmanickam temple in Irinjalakkuda.The concert on the first day was by Shreyas Narayanan. He was accompanied by Nellai Ravindran (violin), Melattur Balasubramanian (mridangam) and Thrikkakara Y.N. Santharam (ganjira).A disciple of P.S. Narayanaswamy, Shreyas maintained the purity and perfection of the tradition he belongs to and sang each kriti in a tempo that best suited the piece, thereby enhancing the beauty of the whole recital. The swara passages he sang for the opening piece ‘Devadevakalayamithe’ in Maayamaalavagowla were reminiscent of the Semmangudi bani. The grandeur of Atana was revealed in the kriti ‘Sree Kumara Nagaraalaye’, which was sung at a slow pace.
Fast paced renditions
In contrast came ‘Jaya Jaya Padmanabha’ in Sarasaangi, in Madhyamakaala tempo and the accompanying swara passages. Bhairavai was taken for alapana before the Navarathri kriti ‘Jananimaamava’ and was tagged with niraval and swara passages. A fast paced ‘Bhogeendra sayinam’ in Kunthalavarali set the stage for the main kriti of the evening ‘Raamaraama Guna seema’ in Simhendramadhyamam. Shreyas rendered an erudite alapana, his full throated voice effortlessly scaling through the three octaves.While traversing through the upper octaves, he made sruthibhedam resulting in the raga Bhauli, which was later reproduced by the violinist in his solo essay. The kriti was well rendered with niraval and scintillating manodharma swaras. Nellai Ravindran on the violin and the percussion accompanists contributed to the success of the concert.A sedate ‘Raamachandraprabho’ in Sindhubhairavi, a kriti by Vanamaamalai ‘Janaki Ramana’ in Kaappi and an Abhang ‘Theerthavittala’ in Aaahir bhaiarv constituted the final phase of the concert.On the second day Mathangy Sathyamoorthy accompanied by Vayala Rajendran (violin), B. Jayaram (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreekanth (ganjira) gave a memorable concert. The artiste chose a fine blend of popular and rare kritis so as to please the crowd.The ‘Sarasijanabha’ in Kambhoji was followed by ‘Pahi Sreepathe’ in Hamsadhwani for which she sang an array of swaras. Panthuvaraali was executed in detail and was followed by the kriti ‘Saarasaakshaparipalaya’.
Supple voice
This as well as ‘Kripayapaalaya’ in Charukesi and ‘Maamavasada’ in Kanada was well received by the audience. ‘Bhavaye Padmanabhayiha’, a rarely heard Madhyamaavathi kriti was rendered well. Lalyani was taken for a detailed alapana revealing all its glow and charm before the kriti ‘Paripahimaamayi’, which was the main item for the day. Her supple voice and amazing control over it gave an added colour to the whole concert. ‘Bhajabhajamaanasa’ in Sindhubhairavi and a thillana in Dhanasri concluded the concert.The third day had Moozhikulam Harikrishnan, an up-and-coming singer, rendering ‘Rama Rama pahi’ (Devagandhari), ‘Sree Parvathi’ (Bhauli) and ‘Kalayedevadevam’ (Ranjini) among other kritis. He showed promise during his Kalyani alapana followed by the kriti ‘Sundareeneedivyamu’. He was ably assisted by Aadarsh (violin), the grandson and disciple of Nedumangad Sivanandan and by Krishnachandran (mridangam).
Display of histrionic skills
A Bharathanatyam solo by another promising youngster Aiswarya Raj was the final event of the festival. The dancer displayed her histrionic skills during the Bhairavi pada varnam.‘Shankara Srigiri' in Hamsanandi brought out the skills as a dancer in her as she portrayed the pranks of little mischievous Krishna in ‘Vishamakara Kannan’ of Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer.She wound up the recital with a Kunthalavarali tillana. Arun Gopinath (vocal), R.L.V. Anand (nattuvangam), Raghunath (flute) and Venu Kurumassery (mridangam) were the accompanists. In addition to these there were concerts by devotees and disciples before the main concerts. The fete was organised by Sree Koodalmanickam temple.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Tribute-to-Swati-Tirunal/article16298748.ece
933,Captivating notes,Harish Bal,2010-05-06,16:16:32 IST,"Captivating notes: Amith Nadig
  A flawless gayaki (singing) style is what most flautists strive to achieve. Amith Nadig has accomplished this and much more.Training under veteran R.K. Srikantan, Amith is one of the few youngsters to be awarded an A grade from the All India Radio. The flautist captivated the audience with his mellifluous music in a concert at Kochi recently.He began the concert with a sprightly rendition of the Abhogi varnam ‘Evaribodha' in three speeds. Mysore Vasudevachar's Roopaka tala composition in raga Kamboji, ‘Lambodara' had a neat niraval. Edapally Ajith (violin) followed it up with excellent swara essays Unexpected scale shifts and the ease in playing high octave passages marked the flautist's swaraprasthara. Considering the difficulty in achieving clarity in fast phrases in high octaves, this was a good feat by the young flautist.
Erudite performance
Next came a brisk rendition of ‘Niravadhi sukhada' in raga Ravichandrika. The best alapana was of a subsidiary piece in Kalyani, in which the artiste adeptly caught the true fervour of the raga. The elaboration unravelled the artiste's wide manodharma and flexibility in merging quick, distant phrases together. The kriti chosen was Swati Tirunal's ‘Pankaja lochana' in Misra chappu tala.The korvai swaras came in all blends and delighted the audience. After a peak into Bilahari raga, Amith played ‘Smarasada manasa' in the same raga. A progressive approach to essay raga Keeravani saw the artiste follow the note-by-note approach. He covered all the essential nuances of the raga bringing out the quality of the raga. Tyagaraja's ‘Kalikiyunde gada' was rendered with a brief niraval on ‘Bhagavathagre sarulaku.'K.U. Jayachandra Rao on the mridangam left no loose ends, packing up the gaps fully. He was quick to grasp the rhythmic patterns of the swara phrases and caught up with the mukthaippus correctly. Amith seemed to muse at phrases as he went on improvising on single phrases in subtle myriad ways. The tani with just the mridangam was another flawless exercise.Amit retained the heaviness of the concert in the concluding pieces as well. ‘Govardhana giridhara' in Darbari Kanada and ‘Tamburi meetidava' in Sindhubhairavi. Thus in the few numbers that the flautist played, he could unfold the true Carnatic flavour and essence of the music. The programme was organised by Dharani society.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Captivating-notes/article16298744.ece

935,Second Thoughts: Come with old Khayyam ,NAVTEJ SARNA,2010-05-06,18:56:53 IST,"The other day, halfway through a virtual conversation, or chat, I found myself unable to recall a much loved rubai of Omar Khayyam. This lapse, unimaginable in one’s youth but part of the daily landscape now, soon had me searching the bookshelves. I was looking for my Omar Khayyam and unconsciously, I was looking for that coverless, disintegrating Jaico edition that I had bought in the mid-1970s for two or three rupees from the booksellers who used to shout “take a look, buy a book” in the corridors of Connaught Place. The book with the tempting sketches of the hedonist resting against a tree and drinking cups of heady wine from the hands of a sinuous saki under a full moon, sketches which, in a summer of artistic delusion, I copied on chart paper and hung all over my room. But that book was nowhere to be found; it has not survived the three dozen years and the dozen or so moves. Instead, I found three other Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, each an embodiment of pure physical beauty. The first, barely the size of a pocket dictionary, has a rich rust-brown cover depicting a medieval garden with intertwining branches, full-bodied roses, singing birds and fruits in the boughs. Each page featuring a single rubai, or quatrain in Persian, is framed like a carpet from the same land. The English version, with 102 rubais cramped into a few pages, is based on Edward Fitzgerald’s translation from the first of his five editions. This edition can be distinguished from the later ones by slight differences in some of the rubais. The most famous of these is: Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough,/A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou…….; in the third and later editions this becomes: A book of verses underneath the bough/A jug of wine, a loaf of bread – and thou…I found this little gem of a book in the bookshop in the gardens of Hafiz’s tomb in Shiraz, where newly-weds come to seek the blessings and a turbaned dervish with deep set eyes and a flowing beard walks around the chai-khanah. The second is a very slim 1955 production that I found tucked away in a second-hand bookstore bursting at the seams. The rubais, once again based on Fitzgerald’s first edition, are all inscribed on dull yellow pages and the remarkable accompanying miniature depictions of hedonistic abandon are in the same yellow and pastel pink. This edition satisfies itself with 75 quatrains and ends with the emblematic signature phrase Tamam Shud or “it is finished.” And the third has nothing miniature about it; it is a large, lush and generous coffee table book entitled The Wine of Nishapur harking to the capital of Khorasan, which once rivalled Cairo and Baghdad and where Khayyam was born in 1048, as well as buried in 1131. This book is based on the belief that in order to fully understand Khayyam, it is not enough to master the Persian language; one has to be Iranian and have “breathed the same air, felt the same spring breeze on his cheeks, enjoyed the same picnic in the meadow…”Using an all-Iranian team, it combines the English rendering of 72 rubais by Karim Emami and the skilful Persian calligraphy of Nasrollah Afje’i with the perceptive photography of the man who has put it all together - Shahrokh Golestan. The photographs are a non-literal, philosophical take on Khayyam- red sunshades of a side-walk café (each Nowruz hold tulip-fashion a bowl of wine), a long shadow of a passerby (whence is the entrance and whereto our exit?), the sun’s last rays on raindrops (the moon will wax and wane over and over again)… Incidentally, nobody quite knows how many rubais Khayyam actually wrote. In the oldest extant manuscript, copied 500 years ago in Shiraz and now held in the Bodleian Library, there are 158. In later versions, succeeding scribes added more until the total swelled to nearly 1200. Edward Fitzgerald culled out the essential ones and rendered them in a free English translation, or as he called it a “transmogrification,” in 1859. He did not pretend to be too faithful to the original, often combining more than one rubai to make a brilliant whole that reads as one poem and not as separate epigrammatic quatrains. Incidentally, there was an Indian connection: his colleague, Prof. Edward Cowell discovered a Persian manuscript of the rubaiyat in the Asiatic Society of Calcutta and sent it to him. The resulting book went almost unnoticed and was soon in the one-penny boxes on the streets until it found admirers in the poets Rosetti and Swinburne (followed by Hardy, Elliot and Conan-Doyle) and went on to become one of the most famous, essential and oft-quoted books for the next 100 years. In his lifetime, Omar Khayyam was known not as a poet but as a philosopher, mathematician and astronomer. It is difficult to believe that his most influential work was a treatise that demonstrated the problems of algebra in which he solved cubic equations through intersecting conic sections; if you don’t understand that, please join the club. He made far-reaching reforms to the Persian calendar, linking it to actual solar transit. He was in fact the precursor to non-Euclidian geometry and to a heliocentric view of the world. In addition, he wrote on mechanics, geography and jurisprudence.It is for this work that the man - who has hundreds of wine-houses named after him - is also commemorated in a lunar crater on the far side of the moon and in a minor planet - 3095 Omarkhayyam - discovered in 1980. One can only conclude that his scientific mind and philosophical bent questioned Divine providence and finding no answers to the perplexities that he encountered, he preferred to focus on the fleeting and sensual pleasures of the material world. Fitzgerald’s rendering of Khayyam’s rubaiyat has eclipsed the other achievements of this remarkable man, at least to the English speaking world, in a manner best expressed by Khayyam himself: 
Indeed the idols I have loved so long

Have done my credit in mens’ eye much wrong;

Have drowned my honour in a shallow cup

And sold my reputation for a song.

  Mathematics is his earning source, theatre his soul. Sitanath Lahkar, professor of mathematics at the prestigious Cotton College in Guwahati, has long been a student of theatre, an ardent advocate of the curative powers of arts, particularly theatre, in a society that is in constant flux. His group, Samahar Natya Goshti, which celebrated its silver jubilee last year, has a repertoire of about 50 plays, all scripted by Lahkar. “I act, direct and write plays. That way, I am a one-man theatre group,” he says in jest.In New Delhi on a private visit, Lahkar languidly reconstructs his initiation into theatre. “No one from my family did plays before me. In 1965, as a school student in Nalbari, I staged a one-act-play. It became a local sensation. I should say that was my starting point.” Having continued his interest in play-acting and play-writing for years, Lahkar came up with the idea of his own troupe in early 1984. “But it got its impetus after theatre activist Safdar Hashmi was killed in 1989. As a group that began with the slogan of theatre with a purpose, we took Safdar's murder as a serious blow to our goal,” he recollects. Soon after, Samahar started street theatre, not just in Guwahati but in remote villages across the North East. “Samahar has 19 street plays. We did about 350 shows then to tremendous response. We were the only group then to do street plays in the region,” he mentions.Lahkar brought his “Kahiyo Sandhi Das” to the 2003 edition of Bharat Rang Mahotsav in New Delhi. He says, “All our plays are about issues touching our society. This play is about surrendered terrorists, termed SULFA. In 1996, when many ULFA cadres surrendered to the Government, they became legalised terrorists. While they got all the Government privileges, they also continued with their armed extortions. It became a new problem in our society.”Among other interesting subjects his plays have dealt with are Assam's student agitation, the serial blasts in Assam, the State's notorious LoC financial scam, the Babri Masjid demolition, communalism, casteism and unemployment.Believes Lahkar, “That serious plays don't attract common people is an utter lie. I have done plays in the interiors, sometimes with just one tube light on, in both bitter cold and scorching summer. I have always got a full house.”In a village called Sokihali in Lower Assam some time ago, he says, “We staged a play in front of 9,000 people. The sound system didn't work for 45 minutes. People waited till it became all right. In yet another place near Nalbari, we performed the play ‘Matir Dheep' in front of 3,000 people with just Petromax lights.”To Lahkar also goes the credit of reviving the memory of Brajanath Sarma, considered the father of the popular mobile theatre in Assam. Sarma was also the first to introduce women actors to the stage. In his memory, every September since 2007, Samahar hosts the Brajanath Sarma Memorial Drama Festival, inviting theatre groups from across the North East and West Bengal. “We do it between September 12, his birth anniversary, and September 15, his death anniversary,” he adds.With a lot of interest, Lahkar informs us that Samahar now has a permanent address. “Finally, we have managed to have a concrete place for our rehearsals. We started off from a cowshed,” he says with a laugh. Paucity of actors, particularly due to lack of money in theatre, he adds, “is a serious problem.”“Most actors in my troupe work elsewhere to run their homes. Often they find it difficult to take out time for rehearsals. It has been a constant problem not just with my troupe but with most in the region. There is hardly any sponsor available. Rabindra Bhavan, the only big auditorium in Guwahati, charges Rs.10,000 for one shift, while we sell tickets to theatregoers for Rs.20 each. It is not easy for theatre groups to survive there,” he points out.Samahar's “Ma Nishada” found a place in the National School of Drama's Octave festival held in Goa last year but Lahkar sums up the conversation stating, “NSD should consider bringing out new plays of new groups from the region to a wider audience every year. But the same troupes keep getting invitations to Bharat Rang Mahotsav year after year.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Staging-a-change/article16298768.ece
939,In Ghalib's skin,DIWAN SINGH BAJELI,2010-05-06,16:49:22 IST,"“In recent years, we have seen several plays and a few serials on Mirza Ghalib. They have caricaturised a great poet by focusing on his relationship with courtesans and their coquetry, Ghalib's drinking and gambling habits interspersed with his popular ghazals. I was pained to see them and decided to project the real personality of the great poet in the context of his troubled personal life and the history and culture of his times. For five years, I studied works by Indian as well as foreign scholars on Ghalib and finally completed the project,” says Charan Das Sindhu, author of 36 plays. “Ghalib-e-Azam,” his latest offering, was premiered at Shri Ram Centre recently under the direction of Ravi Taneja, his son-in-law.
Creative vision
Endowed with a unique creative vision, he writes in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi with equal felicity. His Ghalib is a great poet and a great man who suffered one heartbreak after another and was betrayed by his close relatives. “The death of one child is too much of a shock that breaks one's heart. Ghalib lost seven children when they were in their infancy but he endured all this displaying great fortitude, sharing these deeply tragic moments with his dear wife Umaro Jaan,” says the playwright. “To add to his woes, he had to look after his mentally ill brother — who is said to have been killed by a British soldier during the 1857 revolt.”In “Ghalib-e-Azam,” Sidhu has dramatised three significant events in Ghalib's life — his struggle to get a family pension from his estate Loharu (Rajasthan), his pain at the untimely death of his children and the deep bond with his wife who silently suffered the loss, and his journey to Calcutta and stay in Banaras. Sidhu says he has incorporated into the thematic structure Ghalib's compassion and faith in man despite betrayals, his profound humanism and his contribution to India's tradition of composite culture.To convey the universal relevance of Ghalib's poetry and life, the playwright has devised a chorus which includes references from Charvak philosophy from the Rig Veda, lyrics from Bulle Shah, Kabir, Nanak, Amir Khusrau, Ravi Das and Tulsi Das. The chorus is aimed at reinforcing the humanistic philosophy of the poet. “I believe in Shajjad Zahir's assessment of Ghalib. He said that Ghalib was much, much ahead of his times and was a visionary and a genius to visualise the dawn of a new era which would ensure man freedom and the light of scientific knowledge. I have tried to dramatise all these aspects in a play that runs to two hours and 40 minutes.”A former professor of English at Hansraj College, Sidhu did his MA and Ph.D. from Madison, Wisconsin, in the U.S. and is passionately devoted to theatre. His 33 published plays in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi have been staged and some translated into EnglishA prolific writer, he was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2003 for his play “Bhagat Singh Shaheed: A Trilogy.” His plays could broadly be placed in three categories — plays of social protest, those that critique the educational system and those based on history.Sidhu never uses literary language in his plays. He comments, “I belong to the tradition of Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Munshi Prem Chand. I use the language spoken by the common man and try to capture its vigorous, vivid and effective expression.”What prompted Sidhu to write one play after another for nearly three decades is the encouragement and collaboration of his family. His wife Gyan Kaur played lead roles in most of his plays, his daughters acted too, and now his son-in-law directs and acts in them. In a way, his entire family is his repertory company.Sindhu's plays have evoked keen interest in the academic field. So far, 15 scholars in Punjabi have obtained their Ph. D. degrees on various aspects of Sidhu's works.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/In-Ghalibs-skin/article16298755.ece
940,‘Theatre is my life’,NEEHAR MISHRA,2010-05-06,16:45:21 IST,"Actor Anjan Srivastava. Photo: Mohammed Yousuf
  | Photo Credit: Mohammed_Yousuf He made his mark in theatre and on television when he successfully essayed the role of a typical common man in “Wagle ki Duniya”. With successful tele-serials and films in his kitty, veteran actor Anjan Srivastav is now all set to appear in a cameo in the SAB TV show “Maniben.com”. Here, he talks to us about his long acting career and his future projects.
Could you tell us something about your the character that you are playing on the show?
I play a retired colonel, who is fond of collecting antiques. He is a man of old values and a high temper. He has collected a scooter which belongs to Maniben. The episodes deal with how she tries to get the scooter back from Colonel.I think Smriti is a great actress, one of the best on television. I worked with her previously in “Viruddh”. I have worked before with Contiloe Productions in a few episodes of “Krishna Arjun” and with SAB in “Sahib Biwi Ke Ghulam”. So all three are well connected with me.
For a large part of your acting career, you kept your bank job. How did you manage?
I feel you should just go on doing work. I pursued my acting career and at the same time I did my bank work on the telephone. Fortunately, my chairman gave me all the necessary facilities. I also managed getting good publicity for the bank with my association with actors. I feel I am just doing what's written. And if you wish, you can manage anything.
You are soon to begin shooting for “Detective Wagle”, a sequel to your famous show ‘Wagle ki Duniya'. How is Wagle from “Wagle ki Duniya” different from Wagle in ‘Detective Wagle'?
Wagle is now retired and he wants to do something after that. His wife is still employed and is frustrated with his attitude. He wants to become a detective now and keeps reading detective books. One day he sees an advertisement in the paper about an actress' ring having been stolen. He goes to the police and offers to help find the ring. The police, of course, do not take him seriously because they don't think a retired clerk can be of much help. The show is about how Wagle becomes a detective and tries to solve the case.
Theatre, television, cinema films…Which is your favourite actor's medium?For me, it's theatre, because it has no technical bar. Every performance, every show in theatre has something new, because unlike film or television, it does not capture you in film. I feel that an actor's job is to create, understand and live a character, which is only truly possible in theatre. Theatre is my life. If it dies, so will I.
What are your future plans?I will soon start shooting for “Detective Wagle” and I also have Farah Khan's film “Tees Maar Khan”. I cannot do just any show. For me, the offer has to be up to the mark. Even when it comes to cinema, I like to do only quality films. I am always ready for Raj Kumar Santoshi and Kundan Shah. They are the ones who discovered me and made me what I am. So for them, I am always there. Other than that, I want to see my children well settled in their career.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/lsquoTheatre-is-my-lifersquo/article16298753.ece
941,Of the star-struck,P. ANIMA,2010-05-06,16:42:00 IST,"A scene from the play.
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr taramandal2 “Taramandal” leaves behind a clutch of endearing, enduring images. Amputated ambitions waft through the play, yet keep the mood light. Probably, that's the strength of “Taramandal”. Written and directed by Neel Chaudhuri, the play presented by Tadpole Repertory, recently took home The Hindu MetroPlus Playwright Award. Performed at Akshara Theatre this past week, “Taramandal” boasts some skilful performances, but its bane is its length.Taking off from Satyajit Ray's short story “Patol Babu, Filmstar,” “Taramandal” burgeons into many tales akin to Patol's fate. If Patol's persistent fascination for acting is smothered by a mere exclamation in a movie, he has many comrades in “Taramandal” — a production predominantly in English with a smattering of Bengali and Hindi. Patol's story runs as the linking thread, as many similar tales of ambition, creativity, heartbreak and disappointment unravel along the way. None of them bog you down by the weight of loss — the lines keep laughter close at hand.The play opens with Patol's dream turning into a nightmare — an actor/king robbed of his crown. The sentiment is of an aspirant reaching out to his/her aspiration, yet never finding it within grasp.
Creative disenchantment
“Taramandal” arrests creative disenchantment at different levels. For young Madhav it is not being part of the Beatles musical in school. Reba and Sanjeev thrive in picking up instances from life and enacting them. They merge the idea of the real and the imagined. Acting takes them to realms within themselves, hitherto unknown. So when Sanjeev leaves for Mumbai to dabble in acting, it is his creative chemistry with Reba that dies prematurely.Dushyant tells a familiar tale — of a theatre actor at heart steered to medicine to keep alive family tradition. “There was a genuine effort to convince me that we were the most advanced stage of the species. ‘Doctor man',” he announces to squeals of laughter.Lavanya, a wannabe actress, and Vicky the agent, give a convincing story of many aspiring actors in filmdom. Devika, the Omniphone model, never rises beyond the only contract she has.Amongst this profusion of stories, Patol lingers. He is sketched immaculately, but it is Andrew Hoffland who breathes life into him. He is superbly believable as someone who would listen to Mozart in the dark to fit into the character given to him. His starry gaze and his quiet equanimity even when he knows all he has to say is “Oh!” — all delicately bares Patol.The sets of a few portable boxes and planks work well in “Taramandal.” It evokes a quaint sense of the space, which anyway shifts rapidly. Actors work with military precision after each scene getting in the sets. At times residues and sets from the past scene lingers on giving a sense of the whole. The lights don't play truant either.But “Taramandal,” at close to two hours, suffers, as those part of it loved it too much to trim it. Silence is a potent weapon in a play; it does have a power that words often don't. But in “Taramandal”, silences have been pampered and stretched. Since all sub stories have a similar fate, editing out one, or pruning the tales wouldn't have tampered with the soul. In the crucial scene, where Patol gives the shot of his lifetime, director Aruna Malik sits with her back to the audience. So when she says, “Clap when we're ready, and please don't say “Action” this time,” the exasperation on her face is left to us to imagine.Despite the flaws, “Taramandal” succeeds in delving into nooks of an actor rarely seen.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Of-the-star-struck/article16298756.ece
942,Return of 'Raktharakshas',Sangeeta,2010-05-06,16:17:41 IST,"A scene from the drama 'Raktarakshas'
  | Photo Credit: S.MAHINSHA Nothing seems to move the Malayali like nostalgia does. Song remixes and film remakes have had their due, and now its time for theatre re-runs.Pegging on the memories and emotions of a bygone era, Kalanilayam Drama Vision has re-opened its flagship production, ‘Raktharakshas.' The 30-year old play, directed by Kalanilayam's founder Krishnan Nair and written by Jagathy N. K. Achary, is currently running to full houses in Thiruvananthapuram.
Rooted storyline
The technical finesse and the rooted storyline plus the horror genre can be quoted as obvious reasons for the play's success. Besides there is its landmark invocatory song, ‘Salkaladevi than…,' which has attained a rather anthem-like status.The newer version of the play, which was re-designed to suit the ‘modern taste,' has been cut down to two hours and 40 minutes from the original four-hour duration. The soundtrack was reworked with advanced electronic systems and the scenes re-structured to incorporate dynamic visual effects.“I was aware that the nostalgia factor and the goodwill of the banner will bring in crowds. But Jagathy Sreekumar and I wanted to elevate the play into the contemporary cultural space; hence the efforts to makes changes in the aesthetics. We thus kept the basic storyline intact and re-worked on the external factors. And while incorporating the new additions, we saw to it that we did not go out of form,” says Anantha Padmanabhan, son of Kalanilayam Krishnan Nair.The drama company is currently managed jointly by Jagathy Sreekumar (son of Jagathy N. K. Achary) and Anantha Padmanabhan. The duo decided to revitalise the company in 2003. The original troupe was disbanded after the demise of Krishnan Nair.“We decided to go for a second run as we believed in theatre and its relevance in society. And the movement for us was not a tedious job, but a way of life,” asserts Ananthapadmanabhan, whose mother happens to be one of the oldest actors of Malayalam theatre.“My mother, Kodungallur Amminiyamma, had a close association with Kalanilayam, both as an actor and as the founder's support system. She had immense passion for acting. I remember her telling me about the physical strain she had while performing the play ‘Malabar Lahala.' She was nine months pregnant then. I have been fed and brought up on drama. The same goes for Sreekumar, I believe,” adds Anantha Padmanabhan, who is all set to helm the renaissance of Kalanilayam Drama Vision.The group, which has more than a hundred staff including actors, technicians and ground staff, swears by its manpower.“A play like ‘Raktharakshas' demands concentration, timing and consistency. The effects you see on stage are not computer generated. They are actually physically done by backstage hands. Without such talent and commitment, it wouldn't be possible for us to run the show,” he says.The cast of the ‘Raktharakshas' includes Kavitha in the lead, with Santosh, Sasi, Sukumaran, Thankachan and Sathyan in the supporting roles. The vibrant stage setting has been done by Jagannathan, a long term associate of Kalanilayam. The sound effects are by Jijo and the lighting by Ramchandran and Shijo.“Kalanilayam was once a wonderful treasure house of actors. Veterans such as Aravindaksha Menon were active members of the troupe. Their plays such as ‘Raktharakshas,' ‘Kayamkulam Kochunni,' ‘Elayidathu Rani,' ‘Taj Mahal' and so on banked heavily on actors. It would be great if this new troupe can groom and mould a new set of actors,” hopes R. S. Madhu, a theatre practitioner and a retired school headmaster.
Theatre in the mainstream
Kalanilayam's efforts in pushing theatre back into mainstream comes at the right juncture as the Malayali cultural space is more or less void with cinema entering a crisis and television nearing monotony. And theatre being the most vital form of self-expression, will find its way through in any cultural context.And the evidence? ‘Raktharakshas'; the play with its 30-year-old text and a very conventional stage form, has made it into the minds of the masses minds indicating the changing tastes and sensibilities. Also evident is the Malayali's open mindedness and receptivity towards any work of art done with seriousness and commitment.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/Return-of-Raktharakshas/article16298745.ece
943,Endpaper: Tryst with the masters,PRADEEP SEBASTIAN,2010-05-06,19:09:34 IST,"Like everyone in the room I lusted after these books, but was too shy to caress or even touch them. They were beautiful, rare, uncommon. And very expensive. $500 for a book was cheap here. The average price of most of the books I was looking at was $15,000. Several were half a million. Like the fourth Shakespeare folio that beckoned from the window at the Peter Harrington booth. In the next booth was the other legendary antiquarian book seller from London, Bernard Quaritch. They were all here, 200 rare book dealers I had only heard or read about, from London, Paris, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Milan, New York, and San Francisco. They had brought with them the brightest copies of some of the rarest books in the world to show and sell at the 50th New York Antiquarian Book Fair.The fair, sponsored by the ABAA (Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America) is perhaps the most important rare book fair in the world. It takes place every year in April for four days at the Park Avenue Armory, a cavernous stone structure in the heart of Manhattan. For several years now the fair has been organised by Sanford L. Smith and Associates, ‘the foremost arts and antiques show management company'. I might have spent the rest of the fair just gawking at these books without touching them if it wasn't for Angel, a witty, erudite, vivacious young woman at the Bauman's Rare Books booth who simply threw open the closed glass shelves, encouraging me to handle them. She knew the provenance and bibliographical points of these editions intimately. She took out from the shelf a signed and inscribed copy of The Fountainhead, and handed it to me, noting that Ayn Rand had inscribed it to the architect who had helped her research the book. Price: $56,000.
Old friends
Soon, I was handling copies of first printings of books that I had once known only in text book form. In my hand, for instance, was a first edition, first issue of Keats' Endymion, 1818, Octavo, uncut, top edge gilt. A copy that possibly the poet himself may have once touched. A few minutes later, I was holding a signed, inscribed first edition of Forster's A Passage to India, Edward Arnold, 1924, Octavo, original half brown cloth, gray paper spine label. Oscar Wilde's Poems, 1892, signed. (Signed!). I put it back and picked up a copy of A Room of One's Own, Hogarth Press, 1929, limited issue. One of 492 copies signed by Virginia Woolf in her characteristic purple ink. Original cinnamon cloth. I exchanged that for a copy of The Wasteland, signed by Eliot.And just a little later, the book in my hand was the true first edition of Alice in Wonderland, the earliest known edition, preceding the first published London edition, 1866, beautifully rebound with 42 illustrations by John Tenniel. I realised, with a shiver, that I had just touched the very same copies that these authors had held in their hands. I stopped by at Imperial Fine Books to say hello to Bibi Mohammed, special for being one of the few South Asians in the antiquarian world and one of very few bookwomen in the trade. It was a particular treat to meet in person Allen and Patricia Ahearn of Quill and Brush, who put out the definitive book on modern collecting prices, and that renowned contemporary bookwoman, Priscilla Juvelis, specialising in Artists books.I was interested in modern first editions but there were so many dealers with so many bright copies of the high points of modern firsts, that they nearly became commonplace! Only at the New York fair! And most of the copies here were not only in mint condition, they were also signed. First printings of The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, The Hobbit, a whole run of Ian Fleming, Philip K. Dick, Pynchon, Wodehouse, all signed. Bright first issues of The Dharma Bums, Naked Lunch, Moby Dick, Dracula. Advance reading copies of the first Harry Potter book. Anywhere else, these copies would be considered hard to find, but here it was raining high points. At Biblioctopus you could browse through a complete set of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan, dust jackets intact and signed!I went looking for that holy grail of modern first editions: the true first edition of The Great Gatsby, in that scarcest of dust jackets. And found it, naturally, at Between the Covers Rare Books. It was nice to finally meet the folks at BTC, Tom Congalton and Dan Gregory, who put the book in my hands, and explained how this copy had all the points to make it the true first edition. The price? $175, 000. BTC also possessed one of the highlights of the fair: an inscribed first issue of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises in that very, very scarce dustjacket. I was also in search of my own personal holy grail among modern firsts: a signed first edition of The Catcher in the Rye, but no one seemed to possess the grail.However, Ken Lopez Bookseller, another legendary book dealer in modern firsts, sharing the booth with BTC, had, what was at least for me, the next best thing: the first state printing of Salinger's Raise High The Roofbeam Carpenters in the hard to find edition lacking the dedication page. Only 20 or so copies of this state are known to exist in the market. I opened it, saw it lacked the dedication myself, and handed it back, feeling very privileged. In fact, every moment at the fair was a privilege; a bibliographical shock. Peter Harrington had a Shakespeare folio, something I had only seen pictured in catalogues before. And no one seemed to mind when I cautiously took it out of the glass bookcase and carefully, very carefully, turned the pages.
Aesthetic surfeit
By the time I had done just one round of the booths, I had handled books that few people ever see, much less touch: a copy of Origin of Species that Darwin had held, a copy of the New Testament that Martin Luther had used, an illuminated Book of Hours from 1455, incunabula (early printed books before movable type), antique maps, a complete set of Winnie the Pooh, signed by A.A. Milne, original Pooh drawings of E.H. Shephard, the very scare privately printed copy of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit (80, 000 pounds), the very scarce first printing of Don Quixote, the Olympia editions of Lolita, first editions of Kierkegaard's Either/Or and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, signed sets of Kipling, Jane Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Flaubert, Sylvia Plath, and issues of the Strandmagazine in which the Sherlock Holmes stories had first appeared.It was enough to make any bibliophile swoon. I decided to leave before I actually fainted from so much aesthetic shock and ecstatic bookishness. But I was going to return of course, with two more days of the fair, I couldn't resist. As I walked out, I looked at what I had bought: several lavish and beautifully illustrated book catalogues. It was all I could afford at the New York Antiquarian Book Fair.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/pradeep_sebastian/Endpaper-Tryst-with-the-masters/article16123614.ece

946,People welcome verdict with firecrackers,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,23:29:37 IST,"Mumbai citizens burst firecrackers, distributed sweets and relived memories of the November 26, 2008 massacre as soon as they heard the order on Thursday of the Special Sessions Court sentencing Kasab to death by hanging. Crackers went off in South Mumbai in the predominantly Muslim areas of the city, and people carried placards welcoming the verdict. Various groups came out on the street with banners and posters, passing sweets around.At Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), where Kasab and Abu Ismail wreaked havoc, crackers were burst to welcome the verdict. People queued up to pay homage at the memorial to victims. Right from 10-year-old Devika Rotawan, who was a witness, to Kavita Karkare, wife of the killed police officer Hemant Karkare, families of victims and survivors have been demanding death for Kasab for that night of horror which claimed 166 lives.For Assistant Police Inspector Hemant Bowdhankar, this was the day he was waiting for ever since he helped in the capture of Kasab. Mr. Bowdhankar was part of the police team from D B Marg police station which stopped Kasab and Abu Ismail at Chowpatty as they drove up in a stolen silver Skoda on the night of November 26, and engaged them in a short gun battle.The Mumbai police will always remember the sacrifice of policeman Tukaram Ombale who fell to Kasab's bullets that night. The death sentence has vindicated somewhat his sacrifice, feel the policemen. Mr. Bowdhankar told TheHindu: “I was expecting the maximum punishment for Kasab. Everyone did a good job of giving evidence and the truth was what made the difference. We all welcome this judgment.”Another policeman, who was part of this team and who does not wish to be named, says that this is a judgment that should make all Indians proud. It was the result of teamwork of the Mumbai police, and the Indian judiciary showed the world how it could conduct a fair trial. This is a moment to feel proud of our judiciary as well, he said.However, Ms. Karkare, while welcoming the death sentence, was disappointed that two persons were acquitted in this case. Kasab should not be given an opportunity to go to the Supreme Court and his sentence should be executed immediately, she added.Vaishali Ombale, daughter of Tukaram Ombale, expressed fears that the punishment would be delayed. She, like many other families of victims, called for a speedy end to the whole thing.
“Fit punishment”
Vishnu Zende, the announcer at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) who repeatedly made announcements asking people to clear the station that night, was happy. “I saw what Kasab did that day at CST and this is a fit punishment. Nothing less would have done. We are all very happy to hear this verdict,” he said.The government too welcomed the death sentence for Kasab. Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal and State Home Minister R.R. Patil praised the judiciary and Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, and said there must be no delay in executing Kasab's death sentence.Mr. Chavan said the verdict reflected the public sentiment. The trial was fair and democratic and ended within a year. He complimented judge M.L. Tahaliyani and also senior police officials, Rakesh Maria, Deven Bharati and the Mumbai police for the way in which they handled this case.Mr. Patil said India was a soft target for terrorists and this judgment should send a strong signal to the world that terrorism would not be tolerated. Considering the gravity of charges against Kasab, that of waging war against India and murder, it could be nothing less than the death sentence. Given the brutality of the attack, the punishment seemed less, he said.Mr. Patil once again said that all those convicted who were in Pakistan must be brought to India and the world community must bring pressure on Pakistan to do so. Responding to newspaper reports that the State had no hangman, Mr. Patil said the government would find one.He said the government would appeal to the Centre to fast track the legal procedure so that there was no delay in executing the sentence. In regard to the acquittal of the two Indians in the case, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, Mr. Patil said the government would file an appeal against it in the High Court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/People-welcome-verdict-with-firecrackers/article13637475.ece

949,India among the worst 10 climate polluters: study,IANS,2010-05-06,10:39:52 IST,"A man rows his makeshift raft in the polluted Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad. File photo: AP.
  India figures among the world’s worst 10 countries causing environmental damage, according to a new study which lists Brazil as the most polluting country.The research led by professor Corey Bradshaw, of the University of Adelaide’s environment institute, has placed India at seventh position while ranking the US and China as the largest carbon producers after Brazil.The 10 countries with the worst global footprint were Brazil, the US, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru, it said.Countries were measured on a range of indicators, including fertiliser use, natural forest loss, habitat conservation, fisheries and other marine captures, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat.The study, published in the science journal PLoS ONE on Wednesday, found Australia’s carbon emissions, rate of species threat and natural forest loss were the greatest contributors to its ninth—place ranking, according to The Age.“If you’re clearing a lot of forests, you tend to also to overharvest in the ocean and use a lot of fertilizers,” Prof. Bradshaw said explaining the link between development and environmental damage.He said finding the US and China in the top 10 were not surprising, though he was surprised that a relatively poor country such as Brazil took out the top spot.“The wealthier you are, the more damage you do, on average,” he said. “It’s just a function of human nature. Growth is the be—all and end—all for all economies around the world, and if you’re not growing economically, you’re stagnant, and therefore that’s a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that’s unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Prof. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Prof. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Prf. Bradshaw said the better—ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven’t wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we’d consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/India-among-the-worst-10-climate-polluters-study/article16298674.ece
950,U.S. tightens no-fly rule after Shahzad’s near escape,PTI,2010-05-06,10:38:36 IST,"After Times Square bombing plot suspect Faisal Shahzad managed to pass through several layers of security at the New York airport to board a Dubai-bound flight, only to be stopped minutes before take off, the U.S. has tightened its no-fly rules for airlines.The new rules, enforced yesterday by the Transportation and Security Administration, came within two days of Shahzad’s fleeing attempt.The Pakistan-born U.S. national boarded a Emirates flight, even though his name was added to the no-fly list of the United States on Monday.Under the new regulation, airlines now have to check the government’s no-fly list within two hours, which was earlier 24 hours, after they are notified that a name has been added.“It’s being done because a review of the situation finds that an airline is required every 24 hours to check the no-fly list. The suspect’s name was entered a little after noon, I believe, on Monday, therefore, though on the no-fly list, the airline didn’t have to check necessarily at that point,” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said at his daily news briefing.“The new rules require that to happen at a two-hour interval if airlines are notified that somebody’s been added as a risk to the no-fly list,” he said, adding the reason there were redundancies in the system to ensure that there are many mechanisms that would allow one to prevent somebody from flying, which is what happened in this case.“The CBP (Custom and Border Patrol) takes a locked manifest, that’s required to be filed 30 minutes before a flight, with people that are on the plane. That was checked against that list and the individual was removed from the plane,” Gibbs said.Shahzad nearly escaped arrest with only around 20 minutes left for take-off and planes gates closed but the tide turned later - the gates were reopened and he was arrested.The Pakistani-American was placed on the expedited no-fly list Monday at 12:30 afternoon.Seven hours later at about 7:30 pm, he was able to purchase a one-way ticket to Pakistan all by cash. The flight was scheduled to leave at 11:45 pm.“In his case, the airline seemingly didn’t check the name, and the suspect was allowed to purchase a ticket and obtain a boarding pass,” a senior administration official told The Washington Post.“Under the new measure, the airline would be required to re-check the list within two hours of being notified of a special circumstance expedited no-fly name,” the official was said as quoting by the daily.However, Emirates Airlines in a statement said it “fully cooperated with and responded immediately to all local and federal authorities on all matters” related to the flight in question.The airlines also said it is fully compliant with all US passenger check-in procedures and works closely with the US government “to update security watch lists on a regular and timely basis.”Meanwhile, a group of Democratic Senators urged the US President Barack Obama to issue an executive order that all airlines would automatically have to alert the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) if a passenger seeks to buy an airline ticket with cash.Senators Benjamin L Cardin, Charles E Schumer and Mark Udall said the new policy would bolster airline security until the end of the year, when airlines’ responsibility for checking passenger manifests against the no-fly list is scheduled to shift entirely to the TSA.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/U.S.-tightens-no-fly-rule-after-Shahzadrsquos-near-escape/article16298678.ece

Do it in a phased manner. To say we don't have funds and we can't do it is not the answer. What could be a greater need than protecting human lives? You need Government of India funds and till then you can't set up shelters? How can the Chief Secretary say like this in an affidavit?

The entire country is on one side and you are on the other.

  | Photo Credit: Damian Dovarganes Google Monday snapped up a top Canadian startup which pioneered a 3D interface technology for Mac and Windows PCs.Called Canada's hottest software startup, Toronto-based BumpTop has been acquired by the search engine for reportedly between $30 and $45 million, according to reports. However, there were no details of the deal by the two sides.Set up just three years ago, BumpTop has pioneered touch-screen software that allows use of multiple fingers at a time on a multiple touch screen.Called ‘desktop workspace,’ the software allows users to organise pictures, documents and videos much more intuitively. Users can perform many functions with their fingers, including dragging of items into docks, and playing around with photos on desktop.Though Google has not specified how its will use this pioneering technology, it is certain that it will use touch-screen software in its smart phones based on its Android operating system.Since its Android operating system is basically geared for touch-screen technology, rather than keyboard technology, Google's mobile market strategy is aimed at taking on Apple's iPhone and iPad that use touch screen technology.The acquired Toronto company will no longer sell its software independently after May 7.In a statement on its website Monday, it said, “Today, we have a big announcement to make: we're excited to announce that we’ve been acquired by Google! This means that BumpTop (for both Windows and Mac) will no longer be available for sale. Additionally, no updates to the products are planned.”The acquisition of BumpTop is the fifth such deal by the Mountain View-based Google within a month as part of its strategy to take on Apple.Just last week, it had acquired Labpixies that develops social games for mobile services and Facebook. Agnilux, Plink, and Episodic are the other three acquisitions made by Google within a month.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/Google-acquires-3D-software-pioneer-to-take-on-Apple/article16298798.ece

Ahead of Apple's iPad coming on the block analysts predicted pain for Amazon.“We're quite comfortable having a diverse range of physical retailers, whereas most of the other players would like to have a less competitive space, because they'd like to dominate,'' said a Google official.Google confirmed to the BBC that Google Editions would not be affected by the firm's present legal troubles over trying to digitise millions of out-of-print books.“Plans for Google Editions will happen independent of whatever the settlement agreement is,'' said a Google's official.The search giant's efforts to create the world's biggest digital library have been mired in legal action for the last couple of years.Critics have long claimed Google's deal with U.S. publishers and authors would give them a monopoly over online book sales.Google said it would make “millions of books searchable via the web''A ruling on the issue is due soon. — © BBC News/Distributed by the New York Times Syndicate",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Google-enters-digital-book-war/article16298858.ece

This can be easily crossed especially in case the Kurdish parties, strong in northern Iraq, support the merger.Analysts say consolidation of these factions is a victory for Iran which is highly influential among the Shia formations in Iraq.The Iraqi National Movement or Iraqiyah, headed by former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, slammed the formation of the new Shia coalition as a move to isolate his party. The Iraqiyah party had won 91 seats, the highest among any single formation which contested the March 7 elections.Apart from achieving a simple majority, the Shia bloc has to cross two remaining hurdles. First, it has to agree on its choice of a new Prime Minister. Observers say that the chances of Mr. Maliki getting a second term are slim because of the stiff opposition to his name by the 40-seats strong group led by Shia cleric Moqtada Al Sadr. The former Prime Minister, Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, Adil Abdul Mahdi, currently Vice-President, and Baqir Jabr are the other heavyweight contenders for the post.Second, the Shia parties are debating the incorporation of the Iraqiyah formation, which has wide support among the large Sunni minority, in a new national unity government. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, headed by Ammar al-Hakim, which is part of the new Shia super-coalition, has been insisting on the inclusion of “other national forces” in the new government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Iraqs-major-Shia-blocs-to-merge/article16298855.ece

  Millions of undecided voters held the fate of Britain's political leaders on Thursday as polling was held for the most closely-contested general election in a generation with opinion polls pointing to a hung Parliament while giving the Tories sufficient edge to be able to form a minority government.Tory chief David Cameron, accompanied by his heavily-pregnant wife Samantha, was the first of the three main party leaders to vote and the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg the last. His wife, Miriam, accompanied him to the polling station but was not able to vote because she is a Spanish national.On what could be his last day as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown looked remarkably cheerful as he briskly walked into the polling booth with his wife Sarah and warmly greeted journalists and party supporters gathered outside. After a gruelling campaign, all three leaders travelled to their constituencies to cast their votes.Mr. Brown ended his campaign with an emotional appeal to disenchanted Labour voters to “come home'', while his two rivals called for “change'' after 13 years of Labour rule with Mr. Cameron urging voters not to let “fear triumph over hope'' and Mr. Clegg saying people had an opportunity to ‘change Britain forever''.With as many as 40 per cent of voters said to be undecided all parties were able to claim that there was still everything to play for. The tension was, especially, palpable in the 100-odd key marginal seats where a swing of a few hundred votes could make the difference.Tories, in particular, invested heavily in Labour marginals, some held by leading Labour figures, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Ed Balls, Schools Secretary and one of Mr. Brown's close confidants.
Late surge
Labour claimed a late surge of support among women voters in marginal constituencies saying the election would be decided “around kitchen tables and in living rooms''. Lib Dems' hopes of snatching a number of marginal Labour and Tory seats appeared to fade after failing to sustain the momentum they had gained on the back of Mr. Clegg's barnstorming performance during the leaders' television debates.Polling would close at 10 p.m. (local time) and first results are expected around midnight though a clear picture is not likely to emerge until late Friday morning.No official figures for voter turnout were available at the time of going to the press.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/U.K.-elections-on-a-knife-edge/article16298851.ece

  India on Thursday said the arrest of Pakistan-origin national in the failed terror attack in New York vindicated its oft repeated stand that Pakistan is the epicentre of terror activities.“The development in relation to New York’s Times Square bombing attempt is the vindication of India’s oft repeated stand that Pakistan has been the epicentre of terror activities,” External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna said in the Rajya Sabha.Mr. Krishna said this while replying to supplementaries during Question Hour when a BJP member asked him whether the government would bring to the attention of the U.S. the concerns in India about terrorism emanating from Pakistan in the wake of Times Square incident.Pakistan-origin Faisal Shahzad, earlier this week, had parked an explosive-laden vehicle at Times Square but it was detected before it could go off.Answering questions on government’s stand vis-a-vis U.S.’ plan to supply drone aircrafts to Pakistan, Mr. Krishna said constant vigil needs to be undertaken on the neighbouring country’s usage of arms.“During all our high level deliberations with the U.S., whether it is at PM’s level, my level or the foreign secretary level, we tell them about the relentless threat we face from Pakistan whenever it receives such assistance. We have consistently shared our concerns with the US on supply of military equipments to Pakistan by it.“We have always drawn the U.S.’ attention and cautioned it about our past experience which shows that it has always been used against us. However, the U.S. administration has assured us that regular monitoring is done by it on the usage of military equipment by Pakistan. We are also monitoring it,” he said.Mr. Krishna said the government always sees to it that the U.S. is kept informed about its concerns over such transactions “and how there is always a lurking danger hanging on our head“.He said, “The U.S. government has assured us that our concerns would be kept in mind while giving such assistance and that the use of such assistance would be monitored.”At the same time, he said, “India has not opposed assistance being provided to Pakistan to help it combat terrorism. In regard to supply of drones to Pakistan, Indian government has commented that the U.S. government was free to supply military hardware to Pakistan as long as it was not directed against us”.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Shahzadrsquos-arrest-vindicates-Indiarsquos-stand-Krishna/article16298684.ece

Photo: AP.
  Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a tough test on Sunday, when almost a quarter of Germans go to the polls after this week’s decision to bail Greece out with billions of euros of government—backed loans.On May 9, voters in North Rhine—Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, will be asking how to fill the gaping holes in city budgets as they elect a new regional parliament — while Greece stands to benefit from Germany’s perceived generosity.The majority of Germans oppose the Greek bailout, of which Merkel has pledged the lion’s share, fuelled by a media campaign portraying Greeks as corrupt, lazy and undeserving of German aid.Eight months into Ms. Merkel’s second term, the vote is also a key hurdle for the coalition between her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP), whose popularity has plummeted during their time in office.North Rhine—Westphalia’s 13.5 million voters have frequently set the future course for German federal politics.If the state’s current CDU—FDP government is ousted on Sunday, it would cost Ms. Merkel her slender coalition majority in the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house of parliament representing the federal states, making it tougher to push through promised economic liberalization.Opinion polls show no clear favourites in North Rhine—Westphalia, traditionally a Social Democrat (SPD) stronghold, after an election campaign dominated by such issues as school reform and financial shortages.The reputation of state premier Juergen Ruettgers, of Ms. Merkel’s CDU, was tarnished by a funding scandal when it emerged earlier this year that a party official was offering private meetings with him in return for cash.His main challenger, the SPD’s Hannelore Kraft, is little—known beyond North Rhine—Westphalia, where the 48—year—old hopes to become the state’s first female premier after a rapid rise within her party.Greece’s request last month for a eurozone and International Monetary Fund bailout could not have come at a worse time for Ms. Merkel, who has been widely accused of trying to put off the unpopular decision until after the North Rhine—Westphalia election.The chancellor has since been at pains to convince voters that a Greek bailout was the best move for Germany. After cabinet gave the go—ahead on Monday, Ms. Merkel hurriedly convened a press conference and gave a series of television interviews.“A stable European currency has an incredibly high value,”the chancellor said, justifying the rescue package with the “emergency situation“that Greece found itself in.Asked on television whether she feared a voter backlash at the weekend, Ms. Merkel insisted the real question was whether the government had done everything to save the stability of the euro and protect German interests.“I think this question can be answered with a clear ‘yes’ — and I think the people know that,”the chancellor added.If Ms. Merkel does not receive the hoped—for backing at the polls, this could set a worrying signal, in a state seen as a bell—weather for German federal politics.In 2005, Ruettgers led the CDU back to power for the first time there in 39 years, forming a coalition with the FDP which was a forerunner of the coalition at federal level last year.According to opinion polls, the governing coalition is neck—and— neck with the alternative pairing of Social Democrats and Greens, who governed North Rhine—Westphalia until their national government fell out of favour with voters.However, neither the CDU—FDP nor SPD—Greens looks likely to win the necessary majority to govern. One alternative could be a CDU coalition with the Greens, testing the waters for a possible replication at federal level.Alternatively, the SPD and Greens could bring the radical Left Party into the fold — a move seen by many as a political taboo, due to the Left’s roots in the former East German communist state party.The SPD’s Kraft has repeatedly insisted that the Left Party is “neither able to form a coalition, nor to govern” — although they consistently poll above the five—per—cent hurdle required for parliamentary representation.Sunday will also be a vote of confidence for Ms. Merkel’s coalition partner, FDP leader Guido Westerwelle. His popularity has plummeted since he came into power, and the tax cuts at the core of the party’s manifesto are threatened by financial shortfalls.The state premier, Ruettgers, was the first prominent member of the government coalition to suggest that the Greek bailout could have =an additional knock—on effect on proposed tax cuts in Germany.On Thursday, the government publishes its detailed estimate of tax income, giving a clear picture of the country’s financial health.In North Rhine—Westphalia, where councils are struggling with huge debts, this is likely to fuel further questions ahead of Sunday’s election about the billions flowing to Greece.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lsquoGreece-bailout-casts-shadow-over-key-German-electionrsquo/article16298671.ece
968,Nigerian President Yar’Adua passes away after long illness,DPA,2010-05-06,08:25:08 IST,"Nigerian President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, has died after a long illness, according to his office in Abuja. Segun Adeniyi, chief press secretary to Yar’Adua, confirmed that the President died about 9 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Wednesday in Abuja.Mr. Yar’Adua, 58, had been suffering from a heart ailment since November, which necessitated his seeking treatment in Saudi Arabia and Vice President Goodluck Jonathan assuming office as acting president.A former governor of the northern state of Katsina, Mr. Yar’Adua was elected president in 2007 following controversial general elections.His term was dominated by speculations over his health, as he has suffered a chronic kidney condition for at least 10 years.In the last three years, Mr. Yar’Adua has twice been flown to Germany for emergency treatment and visited hospitals in Saudi Arabia.In February, Mr. Jonathan became acting president following Mr. Yar’Adua’s three-month absence as a result of pericarditis, an inflammation of the lining of the heart.Mr. Jonathan, 52, was elevated from vice-president on February 9 by the Nigerian National Assembly in Yar’Adua’s absence.Yar’Adua, 58, had not been seen in public since November, when he went to a Saudi hospital for treatment of the heart. He departed without invoking constitutional measures to temporarily hand over power, leaving Nigeria with a political and legal vacuum.After both chambers of the legislature voted to install Mr. Jonathan as acting president, Mr. Yar’Adua returned to Nigeria and reoccupied the presidential palace but remained out of sight.Mr. Yar’Adua was a Muslim from northern Nigeria, while Mr. Jonathan is a Christian from southern Nigeria.In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences for the death of Mr. Yar’Adua, in a White House statement.“We remember and honour President Yar’Adua’s profound personal decency and integrity, his deep commitment to public service, and his passionate belief in the vast potential and bright future of Nigeria’s 150 million people,” Mr. Obama said.He praised Mr. Yar’Adua’s work “to promote peace and stability in Africa through his support of Nigerian peacekeeping efforts as well as his strong criticism of undemocratic actions in the region. He was committed to creating lasting peace and prosperity within Nigeria’s own borders, and continuing that work will be an important part of honouring his legacy.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Nigerian-President-YarrsquoAdua-passes-away-after-long-illness/article16298747.ece

Tilted ‘PostOfficeIndia,' the DoP's page already has around 200 followers, from both India and abroad, in less than two months of its operations.As part of its new business strategy, the DoP wants to leverage this unique medium to promote its business, as is being done by leading food chains and other firms in the U.S. and Europe. Though some senior DoP officials are currently managing the web page, soon it plans to have a dedicated team of people to answer queries of followers and paste latest promotions and programmes of the department. It also plans to have sub-categories for various users such as business users, foreigners and have posts State and region-wise.It all began with the DoP posting information about new schemes for users. It posted links to its website telling users how they could calculate postage tariffs or know pin codes of their respective areas. Then recently, the DoP launched SMS tracking facility for Speed Post shipments and told people how they could make use of it.Similarly, through Twitter, the DoP has already started an awareness campaign for India's biggest-ever stamp show that will be held in Delhi next February. It has also been sending messages to people who want to partner DoP in various projects or apply for some tender. Followers have also been making complaints and giving feedback about how to improve the functioning of the department.DoP's Twitter page is also proving to be a boon for those who pursue philately as a hobby, as it has been informing people about limited edition stamps that India Post issues from time to time. “Welcome to the amazing world of the great magician P.C. Sorcar” read a ‘tweet', asking people to get India Post's commemorative postage on the magician. Through another message – India Post greets you on Earth Day! Let's spare a thought for the future of the planet. Let's all join to put together sustainable lifestyles — it is trying to send social messages and connect with those on Twitter.Senior DoP officials are excited by the initial response from its followers. “Wow, Indian Post is on twitter...that's great to hear” wrote one Indian follower, while a few foreign nationals have also shown interest in India Post's Twitter postings. The DoP has been taking special initiatives for foreigners. For instance, during the recent Pushkar festival in Rajasthan, which is very popular among foreigners, it informed tourists about the post office near the fair where special arrangements were made for sending mails and parcels, which received good response.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/India-Post-is-on-Twitter/article16298859.ece

  | Photo Credit: Pat Wellenbach It may look like a piece of gel but it’s a new nano-based telecom technology “enabler” that can make computers and the internet hundreds of times faster.The technology, that may be in use only five or 10 years in the future, is being designed by Koby Scheuer of Tel Aviv University's (TAU) School of Electrical Engineering.Mr. Scheuer has developed a new plastic-based technology for the nano-photonics market, which manufactures optical devices and components. His plastic-based “filter” is made from nanometre (a billionth of a metre) sized grooves embedded into the plastic.When used in fibre optics cable switches, this new device will make our communication devices smaller, more flexible and more powerful, he says.“Once Americans have a fibre optics cable coming into every home, all communication will go through it - telephone, cable TV, the Internet,” adds Mr. Scheuer.“But to avoid bottlenecks of information, we need to separate the information coming through into different channels. Our polymeric devices can do that in the optical domain - at a speed, quality and cost that the semi-conductor industry can't even imagine,” Mr. Scheuer says.In the next decade, fibre optic cables that now run from city to city will feed directly into every individual home. When that technology comes to light, the new plastic-based switches could revolutionise the way we communicate.“Right now, we could transmit all of the written text of the world though a single fibre in a fibre optics cable in just a few seconds,” says Mr. Scheuer.“But in order to handle these massive amounts of communication data, we need filters to make sense of the incoming information. Ours uses a plastic-based switch, replacing hard-to-fabricate and expensive semi-conductors.”Semi-conductors, grown on crystals in sterile labs and processed in special ovens, take days and sometimes months to manufacture. They are delicate and inflexible as well, Mr. Scheuer explains.“Our plastic polymer switches come in an easy-to-work-with liquid solution. Using a method called ‘tamping,’ almost any lab can make optical devices out of the silicon rubber mould we've developed.”His biggest hurdle, says Mr. Scheuer, is in convincing the communications industry that polymers are stable materials.“There is a lot of prejudice in this industry against plastics. But this approach could take us to a new level of communication,” the researcher says, according to a TAU release.He also notes that the process is not much different from the way that mass numbers of DVDs are produced in a factory - except Mr. Scheuer works on a nano, not a “giant” micro, scale.His device can also be used in the gyros of planes, ships and rockets; inserted into cell phones; and made a part of flexible virtual reality gloves so doctors could “operate” on computer networks over large distances.These findings were published in Optics Express.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/New-fibre-optics-technology-to-speed-up-internet/article16298792.ece

973,Nagin (1954),Vijay Lokapally,2010-05-06,17:05:26 IST,"It used to be one of the favourite pastimes of the summer vacations. The kids would wait for the snake charmer to arrive and play his mesmerising flute, gradually lifting the cover of his basket to unveil a lethal reptile, its hood greeting the motley gathering to a session of music and dance.As the flute's captivating notes came wafting through, the children would gather under the tree, the girls instantly transformed into intrepid ballerinas, the snake happily forgotten…The kids, swaying to the flute, held centre stage, and only when the reptile hissed angrily would the snake charmer dismiss the enthusiastic young group. The music, and not the snake, remained etched in memory.
Charming tune
It was only many summers later that one learnt the tune was not his original work. It came from a movie called “Nagin.” The tune, created by Hemant Kumar, became the theme for all snake charmers. The man playing the charming been (flute) in Hemant Da's orchestra was Kalyanji, who later joined hands with Anandji to form a highly successful team of composers. You could hear this immortal composition across the country.It is said that when “Nagin” was released, snake charmers entertained the crowd outside the cinema halls during the intermission. It is also said that some theatre owners would engage these snake charmers to keep an eye just in case the tune from inside the hall ‘attracted' a reptile in the neighbourhood.One had heard of a movie hall in Hyderabad being host to an unwelcome ‘guest' during the screening of “Nagin.”
Strength of music
Coming to the storyline, there is nothing exceptional about “Nagin”. Mala (Vyjayanthimala) and Sanatan (Pradeep Kumar) belong to warring tribes and fall in love when she is entranced by his been. The movie progresses on the strength of its music as the two lovers, confronting opposition in various forms, are separated before uniting in a climax that includes five songs in a row.The closing segment of the movie is shot in colour, but it is the black-and-white portion that stands out for Hemant Da's music and Vyjayanthimala's performance.The ethereal Vyjayanthimala, barely 18, illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty, moving around daintily from one song to the other; from the bewitching “Man Dole Mera Tan Dole” to the poignant “Mera Dil Ye Pukare Aaja…” Of course, the soul of the movie remains Lata Mangeshkar's voice and Hemant Da's unforgettable composition to some impeccable lyrics by Rajinder Krishan. Simply unmatched…There are only a few movies that can be counted for their musical score, and “Nagin” remains one of them. When Lata sings “Jadugar Sainyya Chhodo Mori Bainyya” and Vyjayanthimala responds with her dancing skills, the result is sheer magic on the screen. The close-up shots of Vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effort.“Nagin” was a precursor to her rise in Hindi cinema as an iconic actor, who combined her talents, performing and dancing, to rule the screen on her terms.There are a couple of nondescript numbers too, ironically sung by Lata, but tolerable compared to some mediocre stuff that symbolises music today.Hemant Da's contribution to the movie is monumental. He gets the best out of Lata and then lends his voice to an unforgettable duet “Arre Chhod De Sajaniya Chhod De Patang Meri Chhod De”, apart from the solos that have stood the test of time: “Tere Dwaar Khada Ek Jogi”; “Yaad Rakhna Pyaar Ki Nishani Gori Yaad Rakhna” and “Zindagi Ke Dene Wale Zindagi Ke Lene Wale…”The two biggest recall values of “Nagin” are Vyjayanthimala and Hemant Da. The director is Nandlal Jashwantlal; there is a cameo by I.S. Johar; the villain is Jeevan and the hero is Pradeep Kumar; it was a huge hit and fittingly fetched Hemant Da the Filmfare Award. In small towns, it was common to see a man guarding snake baskets outside the theatre screening “Nagin”, for the charmers would all be inside. A pity the snake charmer has vanished in these times, but the charm of “Nagin” has only grown….",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Nagin-1954/article16298764.ece
974,Obsession with marriage,ANUJ KUMAR,2010-05-06,16:58:35 IST,"Director Gurinder Chadha
  | Photo Credit: 07dfr gurinder new Most of the times we find Hindi film heroines are presented as the epitome of beauty. Gurinder Chadha tinkers with this deep-rooted stereotype, which has social ramifications, in “It's A Wonderful Afterlife”, a Chadha comedy releasing this Friday. If the title gives a backhand compliment to Frank Capra's classic, Chadha says the form flirts with the Ealing comedies, the lightly satirical films which depicted British society in the post World War II period. “I have also put an element of ghost. Horror-comedies are common in Britain, but Indian audience have not experienced the genre. Also, in British films we hardly find British Indian characters. I felt the need for both, and we have a ‘masala' film, which has comedy, ghosts, tragedy and reincarnation with a social comment underneath,” says Chadha, who established herself as the voice of the Diaspora with films like “Bhaji On The Beach” and “Bend It Like Beckham”.
Indian obsession
At the heart of the story is the Indian obsession with marriage dealt with in a light-hearted fashion. “Mrs. Sethi is a typical Punjabi woman that we see on the road but hardly ever try to delve into the story of such fat dames. She has a well-rounded daughter, who is not beautiful in the traditional sense. Frustrated after her repeated attempts to get her married, Sethi kills the people who refused her. Interestingly, the ghosts of four such people help her out in finding a groom for her daughter in return for reincarnation.” She says the thought of reincarnation by doing a good deed lends a moral fibre to the film and therein lies the link with Capra's “It's A Beautiful Life”.Chadha assures us she hasn't fallen for the typical solutions that the girl loses weight in the second half and turns into a swan. “Here the character Roopi is ultimately accepted as she is…only her dress sense changes a bit. The filmmakers need to understand that we have a lot of well-rounded women around and they make perfect brides and mothers. In India you will find such ladies in almost every household. The filmy representation is responsible for creating unnecessary pressure on girls to be skinny leading to an unhealthy lifestyle.”Shabana Azmi plays Mrs. Sethi and Chadha says the actress didn't read the script before accepting the offer. “Like many, I also had a serious image of her in my mind but when I met her with Javed Akhtar during the shooting of ‘Bride and Prejudice', I saw the lighter side of her. There I made up my mind to offer her a central role in one of my films. Mrs. Sethi is a complex character. It is not one of those roles where she had to look inside. On one hand it is over the top, as she is interacting with ghosts, which only she could see, all the time, and on the other, there is a tragic underpinning to her character. Only she could have made it look authentic. Those who have seen the film in Britain have called it an Indian Bridget Jones.”Chadha says this time it was different for Shabana, known for her intense preparation for a role. “She didn't know my kind of humour. It was only when she landed in London that she got an idea. I made her watch some Ealing comedies and then she got the hang of things. She observed the gait, walk and accent of Punjabi women in South Hall and incorporated it so well into the character that when curious people trooped in on the sets looking for Shabanaji, they were unable to identify her.”The film also marks Chadha's association with an Indian production house, Studio 18. There is a growing acceptance for her kind of cinema where culture is used as a tool to transcend boundaries. “Coming from a mixed parentage, growing up in London and married to a Japanese American, I understand the problems of the Diaspora better than many others. British people might not identify with the Indian obsession with marriage, but Italians, South Africans and Chinese would. This has happened with most of my films. People have been able to identify with the characters despite cultural barriers on the surface.” Chadha says during her growing up years she missed Asian characters on television and films. “So when I got an opportunity, I attempted to make them mainstream.” Now when she has succeeded, she wants to have fun with it.
Hindi version
The Hindi version of the film is called “Hai Marjawaan”, but if the past is a parameter, the chances don't look too bright as the dubbed version of “Bride And Prejudice” didn't find many takers. “‘Bride And Prejudice' was not essentially made for a Hindi film audience. It was a way to introduce American audiences to Bollywood song and dance and it achieved that goal. I have seen young American girls still dancing to songs of the film in Bollywood night parties. “Hai Marjawaan” is very much my film. It has much more to appeal to the Indian audience, as apart from the theme the comic lines and gags have an Indian touch.”Chadha is now working on a children's film set in Kerala with lots of elephants around. “I believe kids' films have lost their innocence. These days I find them a lot more knowing. Perhaps producers want to reach out to the entire family. The kids of today are much more exposed to the media and perhaps they get the inherent meaning, but do they need to? I want to make it just for kids. Then there is a film on the Indian Freedom Movement from a British Indian perspective.” Is she ready to rub some Indians the wrong way? “Well, every good film does that. Otherwise filmmaking will become a very bland process. It is still early days, but the film in a way represents my life.

  | Photo Credit: 07dfr antaheen The unsung hill State of Nagaland with its recently concluded Indian Panorama Film Festival is all set to become the precursor of things to come. Emboldened with the success of the first ever film festival in Nagaland, the Directorate of Film Festivals is ready to take the concept to other remote States, including those not traditionally known for either their film industry or hosting such fetes. States like Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, not quite known for their cinema, are likely to host similar events later this year.Speaking to The Hindu at the conclusion of the Nagaland fest, S.M. Khan, director, DFF, said, “We want to take the Indian Panorama Film Festival and also National Award-winning films to all parts of the country. We want people who do not have access to quality cinema to have a firsthand experience of acclaimed films in different Indian languages. For the first time we are also going to screen National Award-winning films in various State capitals. Earlier such films could be seen only in Delhi.”
Local content
After Kohima, the next festival is coming up in Shimla from May 28. Like the North East venture, it too shall have around 15 offerings with a mix of feature and non-features films. “In Shimla, we also plan to screen a Punjabi film, if possible. In fact, wherever we host the festival, we will make sure that local sentiment is respected and at least some of the films are in either the local language or they have content that local people can identify with,” Khan said.Unlike Kohima where stars were conspicuous by their absence, Shimla will keep its date with them during the three-day fest. Rahul Bose, Divya Dutta, Abhishek Pathak and Sivan are likely to attend. Among the films to be screened are “Haat: The Weekly Bazaar”, “Harishchandrachi Factory”, “Boond”, “Keshu” and “Antaheen” — the last one having already been shown in Kohima.After Shimla, the film caravan shall roll into Bhopal in July this year. Meanwhile, plans are afoot to take the festival down South, beginning with a three-day venture in Kerala's capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The summer of many challenges and cine feast continues with another possible edition in either Hyderabad or Chennai.“This is probably for the first time in its history that DFF is hosting film festivals across the country. We don't want that the cinema viewing experience should be available to only a handful in metropolises. We want to make it a universal phenomenon. That is why even beyond the Panorama festivals, we are all geared up to have retrospectives of Kamal Haasan and Ang Lee in July this year.” Incidentally, Kamal Haasan was scheduled to have a retrospective in Goa last year. It could not be held during IFFI as it was felt he deserved more than concurrent shows with other luminaries.All the Panorama festivals will conclude well before the International Film Festival of India kisses the coastal State of Goa in November this year.The show goes on.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/The-show-moves-on%E2%80%A6/article16298761.ece
976,Hero of the common man,Saraswathy Nagarajan,2010-05-06,16:30:17 IST,"Film Director Sathyan Anthikkad. Photo: C. Ratheesh Kumar
  | Photo Credit: C.RATHEESH KUMAR Sathyan Anthikkad continues the saga of the common man with his film ‘Katha Thudarunu,' which reaches theatres today. Scripted and directed by Sathyan, the film narrates the story of a single mother (Vidyalakshmi) who refuses to let circumstances crush her spirit or her sense of adventure. Common sense and sense of humour – the hallmark of every Sathyan film – is evident in this film as well. For the veteran director believes that if one is endowed with the two, one cannot be down in the dumps for too long. And who should know the secret of success better than this director who is celebrating his golden jubilee as a filmmaker with his ‘Katha Thudarunnu.'
Gift for comedy
Right from his first directorial venture, ‘Kurukkante Kalyanam,' Sathyan's heroes and heroines are people next door. Unerringly, he tapped the gift for comedy in actors such as Sukumaran, Nedumudi Venu, Mammotty and Mohanlal to eulogise the common man and his world of joys and sorrows. Over the years, he has gifted viewers with some of the most memorable heroes and heroines in Malayalam cinema.“All of them are my favourites,” says Sathyan with a smile. “But,” he adds, “among them it is undoubtedly Balagopalan of ‘T. P. Balagopalan MA' and Kochu Tressia of ‘Manasinakkare.' Balagopalan is very dear to me. All my other characters, I feel, are his cousins and friends. Preman (played by Jayaram), my hero in ‘Katha Thudurunnu,' could be his younger brother,” says Sathyan.Looking back at his eventful filmography, Sathyan says what he treasures during his stint in Mollywood are certain priceless moments that came his way on account of his work in cinema. “I cherish the fact that I was able to work with such a fine actor as Mohanlal. There were moments during the filming when he blurred the line between reel and real life. One moment, he could be laughing and joking but the moment he stands before the camera, within seconds, he becomes the character,” says Sathyan.A trifle sentimentally, he says he treasures the fact that he could hear, work and see playback singer K.J. Yesudas sing. “That is not something filmmakers of tomorrow would be able to say,” says Sathyan, also an evocative lyricist whose songs have been sung by Yesudas.Another golden moment he holds close to his heart happened while they were recording the songs of ‘Rasanthantram.' “Much before I entered tinsel town, Ilayaraja was someone I idolised a great deal. The fact that I am able to work with him is something precious to me. While the recording for ‘Rasathantram' was going on, Kamal Hassan's ‘Vettaiyadu Vilayadu' was being shot in the vicinity. During a break in the shoot Kamal would join Ilayaraja in the room that he used for composing. I told Kamal that my heroine's name was Kanmani in the film as I was inspired by his song ‘Kanmani Anbodu Kadhalan' in ‘Guna.' Immediately, Kamal hummed the lines of the Ilayaraja song sung by Kamal himself in the film. Ilayaraja played it on the harmonium and Kamal sang along. I value such moments more than awards and hits,” says Sathyan.Not that he is a stranger to hits and awards. Many of his films (especially the ones written by Sreenivasan and Lohitadas) have become classics in Malayalam cinema, while the much quoted dialogues have become film lore and a part of the vocabulary of Malayalis. He remembers with a smile how during the discussions for ‘Sandesham,' Sreenivasan had assured him: ‘I don't know if the film will be a hit or not. But it will certainly have the best of dialogues.'“Kerala was going through a period of political vacuum and that is when we began discussions on the film. Both Sreenivasan and I knew we had a good subject but we were unsure how it would work out on the screen. Finally it was Lohitadas who gave us the confidence to go ahead.” But when both Lohitadas and Sreenivasan became engrossed in their own works, Sathyan began writing his own scripts. “Fortunately, writing has never been a new domain for me. But I still discuss my scripts with Sreenivasan and other friends. For instance, in ‘Katha….' there is a twist to the story that was advised by Sreenivasan. Similarly, it was Lohitadas who advised me to make Narain's character a bank manager in ‘Bhagyadevta,'” says Sathyan.However, he avers that it is essential for a filmmaker to have his ear to the ground to catch the rumblings of change that shapes a society in transition. The veteran feels that many of today's films seem to have lost that lifeline to reality, which is one of the most important reasons for the problems plaguing Malayalam cinema. “I make one film and watch films for the rest of the year to understand what is happening around us. I must be one of the few people who must have watched the most number of Malayalam films that were released last year,” says Sathyan, who continues to live in the village (Anthikkad) that he has put on the map of cinema.Perhaps that is how Sathyan gives us those perfect snapshots of life in the suburbs, complete with three-dimensional characters who live their roles on the screen. “I am one of them,” says Sathyan. “I make a film when I have something to say.”With ‘Katha Thudarunnu' the raconteur unveils another facet of life in Kerala.

  | Photo Credit: special arrangement A modest but elegant house near Muttom in Thodupuzha, with waterfront views and greenery all around, makes for a rich frame for director Shaji Aziz's ‘Oridathoru Postman.' The film stars Kunchacko Boban, Innocent, Sarath Kumar, Kalabhavan Mani and Meera Nandan in the lead roles.“It's a serious A genuine story filled with humour, romance and sentiments,” says Shaji Aziz, who has earlier directed ‘Shakespeare MA (Malayalam)' with Shyju Anthikkad.“The story centres around the escapades of a father and son who live in this house. The father, Gangadharan (Innocent), is a postman in the village but not a very punctual one at that. He often fails to deliver letters and money orders on time and that is a cause of concern for all.“His long-suffering son, Reghunandanan (Kunchacko Boban), on the other hand, is a hardworking youth who teaches at a Public Service Commission examination coaching centre. He hopes to make it big but most of the money he earns from his salary, real estate and other businesses is barely enough to settle his father's bungles,” says the director.
Twist to the tale
“Reghunandanan often helps his father to deliver letters and comes across some letters that were left behind. He finds that the letters were addressed to one Yasin Mubarak and he decides to find him. The story takes a different turn once Raghunandanan sets off to find the addressee,” adds K. Gireesh Kumar, who has written the screenplay and dialogues of the film.Tamil actor Sarath Kumar, who has found great acceptance in Malayalam after his fine portrayal of Edachena Kunkan in the epic ‘Pazhassi Raja,' plays Yasin, a wildlife photographer. “Yasin is also an environmentalist. In fact, the sequences, which were shot earlier, had him requesting the villagers to keep their surroundings free from plastic waste, tobacco and so on. Presently we are shooting the scene where Yasin comes to meet Gangadharan,” says Sarath Kumar, while getting ready to face the camera.Meera Nandan plays Usha, a student at the coaching centre, who is in love with Reghunandanan, while Suraj Venjarammood, Salim Kumar and Jaffer Idukki, play “characters we would hope to come across in our villages” according to Gireesh Kumar.
Playing a cop
Kalabhavan Mani plays a cop, who despite talking and behaving in a comic way, is brilliant at his job and has a great track record.“The character is quite interesting and he presents himself initially in a comical way. I have really missed doing comedy for I love such roles. These days, though, I haven't had much opportunity to do such roles,” says Kalabhavan Mani.‘Oridathoru Postman' is being produced under the banner of Nila Creations. The cinematographer is Anand Balakrishnan. Lyrics by Kaithapram and Anil Panachooran have been composed by Mohan Sithara. The still photographer is Sinat Savier.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Addressing-love/article16298742.ece
978,My first break: Pyarelal,Rana Siddiqui Zaman,2010-05-06,15:58:10 IST,"Music Director Pyarelal
  
How it happened
Being from a musically driven family, I started arranging music at the age of 16. By 17, I became a composer. My father Pandit Ram Prasad Sharma, a trumpeter, taught me music and made me learn violin at the age of 12 from a Goan violinist. A famous director those days, who also gave a break to Kalyanji-Anandji was known to us. Once, I hesitatingly said to him, “You gave a chance to Kalyanji, give me one too.”He smiled and the next thing I knew was that I was to play the violin in the famous film “Haqeeqat” for which Madan Mohan composed music.The song was “Mein Ye Soch Uske Ghar Se Utha Tha.” He was so pleased with my performance that he came running and hugged me after the recording.
How it felt
At 17, it was thrilling and served as a great morale booster. In no time, he offered me “Parasmani”. That was in 1963. I couldn't believe my luck. Babubhai Mistry was a name to reckon with. No one would question his integrity. I and Laxmikant started working on the film. The film didn't do well but the music was a hit. It brought us close to known music directors like Naushad and Ravi and film producers like Tarachand Barjatya.
How life changed
The music of “Parasmani”, especially the song “Roshan Tumhi Se Duniya”, paved the way for us. The very next year director Satyen Bose gave us “Dosti”. It was Tarachandji's Rajshri Productions film. The film had new and young actors but its music was super hit. It got us our first FIlmfare Award in 1964. The most thrilling experience was that with “Dosti”, films like “Sangam” (music by Shankar-Jaikishan) and “Woh Kaun Thi” (Madan Mohan) were also nominated for the Filmfare Award.The award may have brought us fame, but unfortunately, it also created jealousy among our peers. Some of them canvassed against us and we stopped getting films. But we still got films from those who believed in us. Again from 1977 to 1980, we got the Filmfare Award consecutively for four years for “Amar Akbar Anthony” (1977), “Satyam Shivam Sundaram” (1978), “Sargam” (1979) and “Karz” (1980). In Ameen Sayani's “Binaca Geet Mala” our songs were regularly played among the top hits. Lata Mangeshkar made a great contribution to our success. She used to record 10 songs a month for other music directors, but for us she even sang 16 songs a month. Till date, I go to seek her advice in any music-related matter.Today, I miss Laxmikant, (he passed away in 1988) but I didn't stop making music. I have won friends like Jitendra, Dharmendra , Shashi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan in the film industry. Though I feel music has become quite technology-driven today, I always tell my students never to stop the use of acoustic instruments like flute, violin and sitar, for they are the basic ones. Today, there is even less poetry in songs. Dard-e-dil has become dard-e-disco. I and Laxmi did one good thing: We didn't take all films that came our way. We picked and chose even at the cost of sitting at home, unlike Shankar-Jaikishan. I still have lots of symphonies for kids that I wrote long ago, apart from western symphonies. I have few films today but I am happy that I haven't compromised with my kind of music.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/My-first-break-Pyarelal/article16298771.ece
979,Trying out a new turf,MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:25:34 IST,"A PRUDENT MAKE-OVER: Vikranth
  Whether Vikranth wishes it or not comparisons with his famous cousin have been inevitable. “It isn’t fair. Vijay Anna is innumerable notches higher. I’m just a beginner,” says Vikranth. Four films in four years and a solo hero in three of them, yet Vikranth has decided to toe the anti line in ‘Goripalayam,’ releasing today.“I’ve realized that to make up leeway I’ve got to be part of winning projects. And doing a negative role is a sure way of avoiding comparisons with my brother, because he’s never played villain,” he smiles.The young man has no problem admitting that he approached director Rasu Madhuravan for a chance to work with him. “I liked his ‘Maayaandi Kudumbathaar’ and called him up for an appointment. ‘I’ll get in touch with you myself,’ he said, and I thought it was another of those usual responses directors come up with.”But true to his word, Madhuravan contacted Vikranth and gave him ‘Goripalayam.’ “‘The film has 15 important characters and though yours has a negative slant, the scope it offers will be worthwhile,’ he told me. I make a late entry in the film but my character will make an impact,” he states with confidence. Those who have watched the film already have told him, “For the first time you don’t remind us of Vijay.” And wife Manasa who has been pulling his leg about his earlier roles, said, “You look nice in ‘Goripalayam.’” Vikranth and Manasa have known each other for long, and got married quite recently.Madhuravan has been so impressed with Vikranth’s show in ‘Goripalayam’ that he has booked him for his first production, ‘Vavvaal,’ to be directed by Bharatiraaja’s associate, So.Arulraj. Vikranth will also be working in Madhuravan’s next directorial venture.Criticisms about his earlier performances have singed the young actor. “I’ve been pained by comments,” he says. A debut film could make or irrevocably mar a hero’s career. ‘Karka Kasadara,’ his maiden attempt with Lakshmi Rai, wasn’t quite a judicious choice. “When I watched myself on screen I knew I had to start from scratch,” he concedes.Then came ‘Ninaithu Ninaithu Parthaen,’ again a non-starter. “But it had talented names Manikandan, Madhu Ambat, Joshua Sridhar …” defends Vikranth. Neither did ‘Nenjathai Killadhae’ in which he had ‘Ammuvaagiya Naan’ Bharathi as his pair work. “Directed by Agathiyan of ‘Kaadhal Kottai’ it is a film which I had pinned my hopes on,” he says.What did brother Vijay have to say about his performances? “He watched ‘Karka Kasadara’ and complimented me for my dances and stunts. ‘Work hard, talk little, turn a deaf ear to sycophancy and you’ll secure a safe niche in five years time,’ he advised. We meet often and discuss a lot of subjects but somehow, films haven’t been one of them.”Making it as a cricketer was Vikranth’s aim when in school and college. “In school Dinesh Karthik was my classmate and Badani my senior. Cricket, not acting, was the reigning passion then,” he says. Even today actors Arya, Jeeva, Ramesh, Ramana and Vikranth play regularly and participate in tournaments. The college team didn’t welcome the aspiring cricketer with open arms. Put off by the treatment meted out to him Vikranth gave up the game and began to concentrate on cinema.Like Vijay, Vikranth too began as a child actor. And again like Vijay who initially did ‘Senthoorapaandi’ with Vijayakanth to bolster up his career, Vikranth worked with the captain (Vijayakanth) in ‘Engal Aasan.’Getting back to ‘Goripalayam’ Vikranth says, Michael Rayappan, who is producing the film after the successful ‘Nadodigal,’ is immensely happy with the output. “He told Madhuravan, ‘You’ve done your job well. So my responsibility of taking it to the audience becomes greater now.’ For his part, Vikranth is keeping his fingers crossed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Trying-out-a-new-turf/article16298713.ece
980,Messiah off the mark,MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:23:14 IST,"ON USUAL LINES: Sura
  Adamantly adhering to the formula of a do-gooder’s one-man expedition against corruption, Vijay shows that he doesn’t intend to swerve even slightly from the path which he has trod on, in film after film. With ‘Sura’ (U) the capable crowd-puller follows the commercial pattern for the nth time in his career.Sura (Vijay) is the uncrowned prince of the fishermen’s colony, Yaazh Nagar. He offers succour to the people in his area and is looked upon as their saviour. Life goes on smoothly, till, of course, a Minister (Dev Gill) becomes too avaricious and all of a sudden wants to acquire the land on which the fishermen live.Vijay looks smarter than he did in his other recent films, his charming smile is intact, his poker-faced comedy has you in splits most of the time and his danger-courting stunts highlight his agility. Only when he overdoes things a little (like in the scene in court) does his performance lose appeal. So, if despite Vijay ‘Sura’ fails to sustain your interest it is the predictable story and the sagging screenplay that are to be blamed.Writer-director S.P. Raajakumar scores with his witty dialogue, though the fishermen’s gibberish about the greatness of the hero makes you want to scream. With MGR’s ‘Padagotti’ as the base Raajakumar has tried weaving a ‘modern’ yarn in a fishing settlement.A wealthy heroine falling for a poor fisherman is so outdated a premise that you don’t even find it funny anymore. The incongruity in the love affair between Sura (Vijay) and Purnima (Tamannaah) irritates.Vadivelu’s role of Umbrella is enjoyable whenever it melds with the main narration. Otherwise the track is just a time-wasting exercise.And what a let-down Tamannaah is, especially after her appealing chirpiness and pleasing screen presence in ‘Kandaen Kaadhalai’ and ‘Paiyya!’Ekambaram, the ace cameraman, who exquisitely captured the high seas that formed the backdrop of the story of ‘Iyarkkai,’ is in his elements once again in ‘Sura.’Zest marks Mani Sharma’s peppy numbers, and the pallavi of the opening song, ‘Vetri Kodi’ that portrays Vijay as a Messiah, is striking.A patient viewer can put up with a second love song, even when it hampers the flow of events. But by the time the lovers take off on their third duet he is down and out!Shooting an action sequence in the midst of a fleet of cars is fine, but why were two earth movers going this way and that like dinosaurs, in the background? Only the art director can explain the purpose!That it is his 50th film hasn’t come in his way of opting for the beaten track – so what if it is the half century mark and a milestone for an achiever, Vijay seems to ask.Predictable lines may have worked for one or two yesteryear heroes till the very end, but with changing tastes it is time Vijay begins to chalk out a different course. It isn’t dearth of talent, only an erroneous choice of roles. Come on Vijay, you can do it!",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Messiah-off-the-mark/article16298847.ece
981,"‘Raavanan’, a re-incarnation",MALATHI RANGARAJAN,2010-05-06,15:18:08 IST,"""In Hindi my presence has been kept under wraps as of now. I'm the proverbial dark horse, "" says Vikram about his role in the film 'Raavan'.
  | Photo Credit: g mail R
aavanan is almost ready and for Vikram it's another dream come true. “You know, I used to think one film each with Mani Ratnam and Shankar and I wouldn't mind retiring in that blaze of glory,” smiles Vikram. Always a picture of effervescence, mention Ratnam and his Raavanan (
Raavan in Hindi), and Vikram's energy level revs up further! He plays solid roles in both the Hindi and Tamil versions of the film — Raavanan is being dubbed in Telugu too. “Audiences in Andhra are bound to be floored by the subject,” Vikram's words ooze confidence.Interestingly, he isn't replicating the Tamil role in Hindi. “Here I'm Veera and in Hindi, Dev,” he smiles and on a serious note adds, “I hear that it's the first time in the world that an actor simultaneously plays two diametrically different roles in two languages of the same film.”
First straight Hindi film

Raavan isn't just Vikram's first project with Ratnam. It is also his first straight Hindi film. That he is being launched by the same reputed maker whom he yearned to work with sometime ago is a bonus! “You said it. Though Aparajith (
Anniyan dubbed in Hindi) didn't do too well, it's been telecast over 17 times so far. Yet Raavan is my first Hindi film,” he explains.Ratnam popped the question to Vikram just when they were about to begin shooting for Raavanan. “I think you can pull it off. Why not give it a shot?” he suggested. “Are you sure,” was Vikram's pithy response. Being in the habit of working on his physique and make-up to suit every part he portrays Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously. But locations were very remote and sets may not last for more than a month, he was told.So what did he do? “I've played little tricks with my body language and expressions and they should work,” he smiles cryptically. “I'm like a bull in one version — tough, rugged and a man who lives for the moment. In the other, my character is poetic, philosophical, fun loving… just about everything.”After the Hindi audio launch in Mumbai, the attention he got from the girls in particular was surprising. “I mean, after all these years…” he laughs gaily.Has he tried out a new look for Hindi? “Surely not the clean shaven look. I don't intend to look like other heroes. I've plumped for a close hair-cut and moustache. In Hindi my presence has been kept under wraps as of now. I'm the proverbial dark horse,” he chortles.Not many know that Vikram had earlier screen-tested for Mani Ratnam's Bombay. “But the wait has been worth it. Over the years, I've evolved as an actor. I feel in Raavan Mani has transcended his earlier achievements. The films should hit the bull's eye.”Working with Ratnam has been an engaging experience for Vikram. “He's open to your inputs. Raavanan And his energy is unbelievable. After a day's work, we would rehearse the scenes to be shot the next morning, costumes et al, before we dispersed. He would mull over them all night and be ready with the changes he wants.” ”Vikram can't stop talking about the films' locations. “We've shot entirely in India and you can't but say ‘Wow! We didn't know such beautiful places exist here.' We've gone to the unexplored plateaus of the Malshej Ghats, beyond Pune, and to the mist-covered Orccha near Jhansi where we saw clouds just sitting down on the roads through which we walked. Sameer Chanda's sets have blended so well with the milieu that you can't differentiate between the natural landscapes and those created.”They've also shot in the remote areas of Kolkata and the rarely-visited terrains on the other side of Chalakudi. “Manikandan and Santhosh Sivan have captured them so beautifully on camera,” comments Vikram.
Big ride to scenic spots
The unit was put up in an ashram of sorts on the hills, from where everyday they travelled for about an hour by car, then geared up for a 30-minute jeep ride after which they trekked another 15 minutes to reach the scenic spots!“AB (Abhishek Bachchan) and I have given our interpretations of the roles. But Raavan is more an AB film,” says Vikram. And about working with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, he simply says, “It was nice.”Now that his aspirations have been realised, what more could he want? “I've recorded a song for G.V. Prakash for Madrasapattinam along with MSV. And I'm waiting for a chance to sing for A.R. Rahman. I love his Raavanan compositions, especially ‘Veera' and ‘Usirae Pogudhae.' Also I want to turn director one day… so there's a lot more left to be done,” he guffaws.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/lsquoRaavananrsquo-a-re-incarnation/article16299040.ece
982,This joke's on you,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:57:33 IST,"The Sajids (producer Nadiadwala and director Khan) virtually declared war on film critics by setting a historic precedent. They not just refused to have a press screening for reviewers but also went on record giving reasons for their decision — nature of the film's genre, effect of premature criticism on its business, advent of Twitter fuelling word-of-mouth bad reviews, etc.Once you watch Housefull, you realise that's what any smart filmmaker would do. No sarcasm there. Seriously, Housefull is an inspired escapist, borderline plagiarised, no-holds-barred, silly slapstick comedy that does not even pretend to have a plot, let alone logic or plausibility.Many of the jokes are forced in, the filmmaker trying to milk the ridiculousness of situational comedy for as many laughs as possible per minute even if it means letting characters slap each other for no reason at all.While critics revel in taking on films like these and more so, given the public display of arrogance, reviewers seem to have ridiculed the film for all the wrong reasons. Housefull has got plenty of flak for being a crude, sexist, offensive comedy. Like that's a bad thing.Though comedies such as American Pie, Dumb and Dumber, Road Trip and The Hangover have been celebrated as cult classics, the genre still remains in the domain of low-brow entertainment and filmmakers attempting it here are the favourite whipping boys of critics. Most of it has to do with plagiarised plots, situations and even lines, though the makers in some cases have gone ahead and acquired the rights to remake the film (while continuing to take credit for Story, Screenplay and Dialogues).
Housefull is a classic case study of factors plaguing comedy in India, despite the emergence of Judd Apatow's unapologetically offensive films as a legitimate sub-genre.So if these overtly sexist films are accepted and embraced by men and even women of late at an International level, why can't we laugh when Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh decide to do a Ben Stiller gag?Here's why. Originality factors apart, these adaptations are just not funny enough. While Housefull provides a considerable number of laughs in the second half, there are also a considerable number of jokes that fall flat all through the film.Within the film's first few minutes, we learn that Akshay Kumar plays a loser who brings bad luck to all around him and hence, is employed by a Casino that wants to make sure all their clients lose their money. If you are wondering how the Casino remains unaffected by his bad luck, you ought to get out of that movie hall when you still can. This is not your kind of film.The loser then decides to stay at his best buddy's place in London only to get married to the wrong girl (who does a Heartbreak Kid on him during their honeymoon in Italy) and falls in love with another girl (while Forgetting his Sarah Marshall) and in the second half of the film, needs to Meet The Parents… Or the Brother in this case, who is the same suspicious brother borrowed from Right Bed, Wrong Husband (last adapted in Ajay Devgn's All The Best). The makers also find time to recycle gay jokes from Kal Ho Na Ho and Dostana.Yes, the guys are cool and the women are totally hot when they are prancing around in bikinis. But with barely an original bone in its skeletal story outline, Housefull at best works in bits and starts as a series of inspired gags — many forced and a few spontaneous. Hate it as much as you want but you will find it impossible to stifle a laugh.Watch it only if you are forgiving and don't mind junk food for the thoughtless.

983,Reason to cheer,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:55:43 IST,"Trust good old Clint Eastwood to craft a film that transcends the spirit of sport with its political layering without compromising on the integrity of a riveting sports film or the reputation of a celebrated leader of a nation while focussing on one of the lesser-known aspects of his personality.Mandela's interest in the game was not just a political move but a “human calculation,” as the newly elected President (Morgan Freeman lends a lot of grace and dignity to Mandela) insists, quite early on.The docudrama begins with Mandela's first day on the job as the new President. “He can win an election but can he run a country,” asks the front page of a daily as he goes for his early morning walk, with just two security guards for company.Eastwood loses no time at all to introduce us to the security risks, and the sub-plot with his security aides keeps the drama alive (the moment with the plane over the stadium is a heart-stopper) when the sport portions of the film are yet to take off.Though based on the book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation, the filmmaker takes some cinematic licence to replace Mandela's source of inspiration. Apparently, Mandela in reality had given the rugby captain Pienaar an extract from Theodore Roosevelt's speech that inspired him and not the poem Invictus written by William Ernest Henley.
Invictus is the story of a President who decides to channel the country's passion for sport as a unifying force to blur racial differences by deciding to back the dominantly white Springboks team when the rest of the Sports Ministry is baying for the blood of the players and stepping up the pressure to change the name of the team.But it's also the story of the other leader, the rugby captain Pienaar (Matt Damon's on a roll — The Green Zone and now, Invictus) who has to motivate the team and back the lone-black player in the team and see the team through its rough patch and strive for the kind of glory they hadn't even imagined.Eastwood's genius lies in making us see how the challenges both these leaders face were not too different and the solutions weren't too different either.Between Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, the actors have oodles of charisma to charm the audience and they turn in a sincere, natural portrayal, backed with some crisp writing (Anthony Peckham).It helps that Eastwood resists the urge to hero-worship the President and treats him like an ordinary dutiful old man, who despite his superhuman faith in humanity, is a vulnerable workaholic with a miserable domestic life.This sort of sensitivity and balance is what makes Eastwood the master filmmaker that he is and that's exactly what makes Invictus transcend the sport film genre and keeps us hooked till the very end despite the predictability of the format.A truly inspiring and uplifting sports film guaranteed to make you feel good.
Genre: Drama
Director: Clint Eastwood
Cast: Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, Tony Kgoroge
Storyline: Two leaders, Nelson Mandela and Pienaar, the captain of his rugby team, need to inspire a country and the team by setting an example and leading from the front.

Kutti Pisasu' starts off with ‘Amman' specialist Ramya Krishnan reprising the role of yet another village protector, this time as Kenathadi Kali. Once her prowess is established through two sequences, including one where screen scorcher Nasser is reduced to a pale shadow of himself, it's time to move on to 200 years later.Priya (Keethika), a precocious child, the daughter of Ramjhi and Sangeetha, gyrates to adult steps and draws like a dream, coming up with a visual of an ancient yellow car. Soon, she is possessed by the spirit of a girl called Savithri (a terribly out-of-sorts-and-shape Kaveri — whatever happened to the cute actor?).Cut to flashback mode, and the stories of Savithri, her brother, Karuppu (Ganja Karuppu) and their adored yellow car (washed only with warm water, mind you!). Savithri is cheated by her fiancé Nanjappan (Riyaz Khan), and given as sacrifice by his sorcerer friend Mandiramoorthy. Her brother also dies in the process of saving her. His spirit is locked in the yellow car, till Kenathadi Kali frees him to avenge his sister's death. Two of Nanjappan's friends are killed by the possessed child — one in the harbour and another in the circus ring — and, he's next in line. Enter a miniature villian (Mandiramoorthy's guru) mouthing “Jakkamma” ever so often, and the stage is set for a lopsided fight, not-so special effects and all.Finally, evil is vanquished, but not before you are forced to sit through some more songs where your heart bleeds for the child artiste, who seems to have little else to do other than look startled, angry and roll her eyes, all this in the midst of bad lip-sync.Ramjhi and Sangeetha have little to do except perform pujas, make thayir saadham, and cry about their daughter's fate. And, Delhi Ganesh plays the grandfather who loves ftv. Ouch!There's little to say in terms of story or production value. Strange, considering director Rama. Narayanan is a veteran in children's and godly movies, even if they are terribly over-the-top! As for the music, Deva's brief seems to have been to come up with such high-decibel dabbankuthu that even the Transformers-look-alike dances. He succeeds.Now, the only question is how this can be called a fun film for the kids to go to this summer! There's gore, the sacrifice scene leaves you retching and the dialogues are written with least sensitivity.

The big move
Director Vijaya Varman's Biriyani, an emotional drama of the plight of a young domestic help, has won teenage actor Poo Myli, the ‘Best Actress' award at the Short Film Festival of Los Angeles. The film, based on Subhalakshmi Narayanan's short story, and with music by Mohan Narayanan, has been Varman's stepping stone into films. He now directs a full-length Tamil film, Ninaivodu Vilayadu, starring Master Mahendran and Nandana. The music is by Swar Mogi, while Varman has written the story, screenplay and dialogues.”
Recreating a hit
Twenty-seven years ago, Thyagarajan acted with Sarita, Silk Smita and Jayamalini in the huge hit Malayoor Mambattiyan, which was remade in Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Now, he has cast his son Prashanth in the new version of the film, titled Mambattiyan, with Meera Jasmine and Mumaith Khan for company.Will the new film re-create the magic of the original? With Prakash Raj and Vadivelu in key roles, the theme should work with present-day audiences, we think.
Getting real
Tiruvannamalai's 10-day Brahmotsavam, where more than 15 lakh devotees throng the town, forms a major part of the A.G. Raja-produced , Ivar. Directed by N. Priyan, the film was initially meant to be Raja's directorial venture. “Since I was introducing four new actors as the main leads, I felt that someone as talented as Priyan should also be given a chance to prove his talent. And, he has done a wonderful job,” says Raja.The film revolves around four youngsters who are interested only in the present. Since the film focusses on the men, the songs feature male voices too. Also, there are no choreographed dances or ‘contrived' fight sequences, says the producer. “There's a dance, but an impromptu one that happens in a TASMAC bar,” he adds.
Novel attempt
Director Keera's Pacchai Engira Kaathu is the story of 27-year-old Pacchai Ramkumar, narrated from the point of view of seven individuals. Based on a real-life incident, Keera's movie is about the life of youth who blindly support politicians and parties. Newcomer Vasagar plays the hero, while another new face Devathai plays his love interest. Says Keera: “The story is narrated in flashback mode by four persons at the time of the hero's unlikely death. As the film progresses, two more persons join the narration, including the heroine's sister. Finally, I, the director, complete the story.”

ellai Pattinam is about the clash of ideals between a rich girl and a middle-class girl to win the heart of an underprivileged boy in college.

he svelte Shilpa Shetty judged the first season of ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa', the second season of ‘Bigg Boss' on Colors and will now be judging the second season of the war-of-the-genders dance competition, ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' on Star Plus. The actor on judging celebrities and why television works for her.
You have only two films — “The Man” and “Desire” lined up. Are you gradually bidding goodbye to films?
Sunny Deol's “The Man” has been stalled. I shot for “Desire” six months ago, but there is still some work left. I really wanted to take a break… I have been working continuously for the last 18 years. I have so much happening that I just do not have the time.
Meanwhile, it seems you have taken a liking to television — after ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa' and ‘Bigg Boss', it is ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha now.
Television works well for me because it does not take too much of my time, the audience sees me and I enjoy the chance to say my bit in front of people. So I always try to do something different on TV every year. ‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance show and is obviously different from ‘Bigg Boss' in which I was a host. And though I have been a judge before, this is a new format.
But there doesn't seem to be any significant difference in the show's format — it will be the same girls versus boys competition.
The difference would be us — the new set of judges. The show is being aired on Star Plus and so more money has been spent on the production, packaging, costumes this time around.
Being a dancer yourself, do you get impatient or irritated when untrained celebrities perform badly on a platform such as likethis?
‘Zara Nach Ke Dikha' is a dance-oriented show and I know a bit of dance, so my job is a little easy. All the participating celebrities are good dancers — we have sifted out the bad ones.
Does the at fact that you will be judging ‘TV celebrities' make it difficult for you to criticise them?
All the participants know that they will be judged; and that we are here to judge them. We are not here to pinpoint who is a bad dancer and who is better. We are here to see who performs better on a particular day.
Will the jury be biased towards the girls because it consists of two women — Vaibhavi Merchant and you — while Arshad Warsi is the only mansole male?
As judges, we have to forget the gender we belong to and have an unbiased opinion. I will try my best to do that.
Is there any particular dance form which you are still not confident about?
I'm not very good with locking and popping. I'm so glad it has come in recently; and not in my time (
laughs). I don't think my body is meant for that kind of dance form; my arms are very long. I just love the way these new kids do this dance. I'm amazed by the talent we have in our country. I'm a Bharatnatyam dancer but for “Desire” I had to learn Odissi and it was difficult, inspite of being a dancer.
Who are your favourite dancers from the industry?
I think Rishi Kapoor was a phenomenal dancer. He never missed a single beat. See his songs. I'm sure the choreographer never ever told him to do the step a particular way. He was superb … what synchronisation!
We saw husband Raj Kundra by your side throughout the IPL. Any chances of him making an appearance on this show?
Star Plus cannot afford him. They still do not have that kind of money.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Reality-bytes/article16298702.ece

  The master story teller is back to making a socio-romantic musical entertainer after a gap of five years. Veteran filmmaker K. Raghavendra Rao is making his 105th celluloid statement, Jhummandhinaadham with a theme that largely harps on our rich traditional music and heritage, according to producer Lakshmi Prasanna. Starring her brother Manoj Kumar Manchu and debutante Tapsi in the lead with her father Mohan Babu playing a pivotal character.At the Ramoji Film City, the atmosphere is one of celebration. A celebration showcasing unity and patriotism, capsuled into a song written by Chandra Bose and composed by Maragatha Mani Keeravani. Raghavendra Rao usually does the preliminary designing of the song sequence, making the job of the choreographer easy.Choreographer Suchitra Chandra Bose in consultation with the master craftsman is guiding the actors to perform that includes apart from the lead pair and Mohan Babu, Suman, Brahmanandam, M.S. Narayana, Pragathi, Aishwarya and others.
Desamante Matham kadhu… the song is played on the nagara and lensman S. Gopala Reddy captures the emotions of the actors. Desamante Manushuloy the song continues as the next block is taken for filming. It reminds you of the song, Punyabhoomi Naa Desam Namo Namaami from Major Chandrakanth in which the legendary N.T. Rama Rao played the title role. Keeravani is at his best one more time, you agree as you listen to the song.“It is a musical story with nine songs,” informs Lakshmi Prasanna. “A lot of research has gone into the making of these songs and the story. We are forgetting our traditional songs. How many of us know today that once during marriage ceremonies, songs recalling the family tree and roots of the bride/bridegroom are sung as the marriage parties reach each other's house. It is like nostalgia to the older generation and introduction of our rich traditional heritage to the young audience.”A wide variety of musical bonanza- from folk, lullaby, devotional, patriotic to fusion music awaits the discerning cine goers. “There is a competition song filmed on dad (Mohan Babu) and Manoj on the lines of the one that was shot on Nagesh and dad in Allari Mogudu,” says Lakshmi Prasanna.The camera now focuses on Manoj and Mohan Babu as they place their steps to Keeravani's tune. “This is the first time dad is playing a full length role in a Manoj film,” says the happy producer. “This movie presents Manoj in a different light, as a soft looking guy. In looks and acting it is a complete makeover from his earlier movies,” says the proud sister. Manoj has that certain ease in his acting be it in action, comedy or emoting.The conversation shifts to Tapsi, the newcomer to Telugu cinema. “ She plays a girl from the U.S. who is on a research work on Telugu traditions, music and culture. Manoj acts as her guide and the journey begins,” she smiles. The journey takes the audience on a roller coaster ride of entertainment laced with a gamut of emotions, wit, humour and a medley of music as the title indicates.“After this song, we have a four day talkie part to finish before flying to South Korea to film the remaining song on the lead pair,” signs off Lakshmi.

988,Bale Piaa!,SUDHISH KAMATH,2010-05-06,14:30:05 IST,"Very few actors here come without strings attached. Especially, the watchful eye of mom or dad on the sets. Piaa Bajpai of Goa fame is one of those rare actors who does it all by herself.As her film Bale Pandiya, directed by Siddharth Chandrashekar, readies for release (the audio launch happened recently), Piaa talks about her journey that began here with the Khosla Ka Ghosla remake, Poi Solla Porom, and continues with the K.V. Anand film Ko, to be out in August.
How it started
But, her journey to showbiz started five years ago when the girl from Uttar Pradesh left home for Delhi after doing a diploma in computer science.“I wanted to prove to my parents that I could live by myself. Giving tuitions was good business in Delhi back then. You could make up to Rs. 1,500 a kid. So if you took tuition for seven to eight kids, you could make good money. I also worked as a receptionist.“After a year, I got tired of going to office, coming back and doing nothing else. For a year, I had not taken money from my parents. Then, they grew confident about me, and I shifted to Mumbai,” she recalls.
Dubbing for serials
Piaa started dubbing for TV serials. “Since I was from U.P., my Hindi was good. I could make Rs. 250 - Rs. 300 doing just one session. Then, I started getting offers only for dubbing. When you want to see yourself on screen, but are dubbing instead for someone else, it's very depressing. So, I decided to stop dubbing, and started doing print ads, then commercials and music videos.”The auditions led to a commercial directed by Priyadarshan. “I was very apprehensive about working in the South because I didn't know anyone here. But, when Priyadarshan Sir asks you if you want to audition for a Tamil film, how can you not do it? I lied to him that Tamil wouldn't be a problem,” she laughs.“They auditioned me in English and Hindi and the Tamil audition came much later.”Now that she has shot for a few Tamil films (
Poi Solla Porom, Aegan, Goa, Bale Pandiya and Ko), Piaa understands the language better. “I write my lines in English-Hindi and memorise them, and the director tells me how to emote.”“In Bale Pandiya, I play a happy girl living with her grandfather. She falls in love with a boy who thinks he's a loser. We shot for three to four months. It's a good role,” she says, narrating an anecdote about how she fought sea-sickness with cans of tamarind. “We were shooting on a yacht, and I wasn't used to the sea.”Shooting by the beaches and partying in Goa for Venkat Prabhu's Goa, and now sailing. What a difficult life for an actor!“It's not like that. You have to shoot when you are not well. Sometimes, in the hot sun… you have to sing, dance, smile, not be tense, or look tired. No matter what's going on in your mind, it should not show on your face. It gets tough for me sometimes, because, when I am upset, it shows on my face.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Bale-Piaa/article11639885.ece

When I finished my masters in Bio-technology, I got a chance to act in a film by popular director Logidas. Unfortunately, it did not materialise. So when Meera Kathiravan, his associate, asked me to act in his film, I didn't evince much interest. Moreover, it was not the role of the heroine. But the director succeeded in convincing me and the film was Aval Peyar Thamizharasi.It was exciting to see myself on the screen. I watched the film in a theatre in Tenkasi where I had been on a holiday. To my surprise, people recognised me and some even came forward to talk to me. They wished that I should appear on screen more often.After my debut, people recognise me wherever I go. Except that nothing much has changed. Acting is a passion for me. I would like to do more powerful roles and make a mark in the industry. I did not do any other film for nearly a year as I was waiting for a good break.

Akshay plays monkey!
With hi-definition technology being the order of the day, Housefull producer Nadiadwala Grandson has tied up with Hungama Digital Media and launched a digital promotion campaign for the multi-starrer. An online game application has been devised on the Akshay-monkey slapping episode from the film. The player can choose to be either the ape or Akshay and the objective of the game is to slap the other person harder.When we asked Akshay to make a choice, he jested, “I'd rather be a monkey as his reflexes are stronger.” When it was Deepika's turn to answer, she spontaneously replied, “I'd always be Akshay because I could never hit him.”
No Ranbir for now
There has been much talk in tinseltown about Ranbir-Deepika's on-off relationship, not just onscreen but off screen as well. Last seen together in Bachna Ae Haseeno, there was a buzz about Deepika signing her next film opposite the young Kapoor.When queried about it at an event, she curtly said, “When I sign, I'll let you know.”
Humour to the rescue
Sajid Khan, director of Housefull, is making a tall claim. He brags that Akshay's comic timing in his film will remind the audience of the peerless comedy king, Kishore Kumar, especially in his scenes with Riteish.The proof of the pudding lies in the eating. And Akshay amply provided the proof when he bailed Sajid out. Some time back, Manoj Kumar was miffed with Sajid and had said that flinging mud at others only makes the person who is flinging the mud, dirty. At the Housefull event, a contrived Sajid responded to Manoj's comment with, “Manoj Kumar is a veteran and I will never make fun of him. If he thinks I am mud, then so be it.”Akshay instantly quipped, “After all, a lotus can grow only in mud,” and made an otherwise sheepish Sajid grin from ear to ear.
Archana's role
Ask Badmaash Company director what his wife Archana Puran Singh's contribution to his film was and the hunky Punjabi actor-turned-director says: “When I took a break for this film, she became the husband as well as the wife. She took care of the finances which took most of the burden off my head. Finances are something that can kill a man; and this was why I couldn't become a director earlier. I was trying to fulfil my duties as breadwinner, husband and father. Finally, when I decided I needed to do something for myself and live my dream for once, she said ‘Go fulfil your dream'.

K.L.V. Vasantha, T.K. Shanmugham, T.R. Mahalingam, T.S. Balaiah, N.S. Krishnan, T.A. Mathuram and Kumari Rukmini
K.L.V. Vasantha was one of the popular heroines of early Tamil cinema. Slim and attractive, she could also sing well. She made her debut in Sri Kanda Leela (1938), a Premier Cinetone, Coimbatore production, directed by noted filmmaker H.S. Mehta, and written by well-known writer L. Nanjappa Chettiar, one of the directors of the production company and studio.Vasantha hit big time in 1939 when she played the title role in Rambayin Kaathal, directed by noted filmmaker B.N. Rao. Critics remarked that the celestial beauty of Lord Indra's court, Rambha, would have looked like Vasantha!Following the success of Rambayin Kaathal, Vasantha was cast in Bhooloka Rambai. A folktale with many twists and turns, it's about a prince (Shanmugham) falling in love with Bhooloka Rambha (Vasantha), their secret marriage, getting a child to be sacrificed, and later saved by Divine Grace… His friend (Mahalingam) travels with him; they meet birds that talk and predict their future. Again directed by Rao, the film was produced by M. Somasundaram (Jupiter Somu) and M.D. Viswanathan under the banner of Salem Shanmugha Films and Vijaya Maruthi Pictures at Central Studios, Coimbatore. During the making of the film, the producers ran into financial problems and work halted for sometime. Around this time, the later day Indian movie mogul S.S. Vasan had just entered as a distributor with his Gemini Pictures Circuit (GPC) and was looking for movies for distribution. He called on Rao at Coimbatore and asked him whether he could complete the film in time for Deepavali if he funded the project. He also told him he was in the process of acquiring a studio in Madras, and promised Rao that he would be the director of his first production. Vasan who never went back on his word engaged Rao for the first Gemini Studios production Madanakamarajan (1941) which somewhat interestingly had much common ground in Bhooloka Rambai (both were written by well-known writer and playwright B.S. Ramaiah.)
Bhooloka Rambai proved a success and Vasantha's popularity grew by a few more notches. Besides being cast as the heroine in Madanakamarajan, Vasan cast her as ‘Chandralekha' in his mammoth movie. However, for many reasons, Vasantha opted out, and T. R. Rajakumari came on board to create movie history.In those days, Tamil films were screened all over South India without any dubbing or subtitles, and people watched them with interest. To give them an indication of the storyline, producers invariably had an English title for each of the Tamil film. For example, Gumasthavin Penn had the title, Clerk's Daughter!For the same reason, the name of this film in English was given in posters as Bhooloka Rambha and not ‘Rambai' as in Tamil. B.N. Rao told this writer years later that the name of the celestial dancer was Rambha and not Rambai!As usual, the N. S. Krishnan-T.A. Mathuram pair took care of the comedy and sang a couple of duets in their own inimitable style.
Remembered for: the interesting storyline, gripping on-screen narration, the impressive presence and performance of Vasantha, and the comedy of Krishnan-Mathuram.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Blast-from-the-past-Bhooloka-Rambai-1940/article16298691.ece

Suriya has got a makeover and would sport a new look as a police officer, with a stylish moustache. “His film Kaakha Kaakha is still quite popular with Tamil audience. It was tricky for me to pull out Suriya off that image. I created this character as a personality that is a contrast to the role of ‘Anbuchelvan',” he told The Hindu recently.The film will have a lot of action sequences and a good amount of hilarity, with Vivek handling the comedy track. Hari promises that the movie will have logical sequences and everyday issues are narrated in cinematic language. The director does not brook comparisons with filmmakers scripting off-beat movies. “They are doing an excellent job and taking Tamil cinema to the next step. But the industry also needs some dose of commercial element. I have no intentions to attempt such different storylines. Commercial movies are my forte.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Hari-hopeful-of-Singams-roaring-success/article16303871.ece

Bhattacharyya told reporters here on the sidelines of a conference on “Challenges in Coal Sector,” organised by Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE).“Due diligence is being done on five proposals from three global companies for partnerships in Australia, Indonesia and the U.S.,” Mr. Bhattacharyya said.The company has already appointed three consultants — DSP Merrill Lynch, Royal Bank of Canada and Royal Bank of Scotland — for fast-tracking the proposed ventures. The world’s largest coal producer, which meets nearly 82 per cent of the country’s requirement of the dry fuel, has already named U.S.—based Peabody as a possible ally for such ventures.At present, the company is looking to forge equity and joint venture agreements with the concerned companies, but it may consider entering into off-take pacts later.In the current fiscal, CIL has earmarked 60 per cent out of its total capital outlay of about Rs. 10,000 crore for such global deals.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/CIL-may-seal-Rs.-7700-cr-in-overseas-deals-this-month/article16299592.ece
996,Food inflation softens,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,13:05:45 IST,"The arrival of rabi (winter) crops has helped reduce prices of essential items as food inflation further eased.
  With prices of essential commodities cooling a tad on arrival of rabi crops, food inflation softened further to 16.04 per cent for the week ended April 24 from 16.61 per cent in the previous week.Even as the general expectation is that a normal monsoon, if as projected by the India Meteorological Department comes true, would help in easing food prices further, fuel inflation held steady at 12.69 per cent owing to higher prices following the hike in duties on petrol and diesel.Significantly, despite persistent demands by the Opposition earlier this week for rolling back the hike in fuel prices, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee held firm and expressed his inability to do so owing to the fragile fiscal situation.The gradual decline in food inflation for the second week in a row has raised hopes of some moderation in the overall inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for April from the March level of 9.9 per cent. The headline WPI inflation data for April is expected to be released next week.According to Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu, the headline inflation is likely to soften to 6-7 per cent in the coming months. “I expect the overall WPI to come down to 6-7 per cent in the next three months,” he said.However, despite the declining trend in recent weeks, food inflation has remained above 15 per cent since November last year. Keeping this mind, the United Nations' organisation ESCAP has expressed concern over the food price spiral even as it projected a cool-down during the year.During the week, inflation eased on account of lower prices of fish, wheat, fruits and vegetables which declined by one per cent each. However, the prices of tea went up by 13 per cent while gram, maize and eggs were also dearer by one per cent each.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Food-inflation-softens/article16298862.ece

  As board examinations slowly fade into memory and students prepare for their results, the season of obtaining application forms for various courses has begun.Most government and self-financing institutions have started issuing application forms for admission into professional as well as arts and science courses. But, with intense competition pushing students to have multiple backup options, application fee collected along with the forms seems to have become a revenue-generating option for colleges, say parents and students.G. Abdul Haseeb, a parent, says “Some professional colleges give 15-page application forms with pictures of the college library and canteen printed on glossy paper. As a result, they charge exorbitant amount as application fee.”He says that it especially affects students in the 60-to-75 percentile category who might want to keep options open and end up applying to many colleges. “Some kind of regulation is needed and a uniform application fee regime must be brought in.”K.Ramnath, awaiting his class XII results, says “My parents wanted me to apply to many courses. I have already spent more than Rs.2,000 on application forms. I will also be applying for law and a couple of bachelors programmes.”Students also say that if one applies for two or more courses in some colleges, a separate fee has to be paid each time. The application cost of popular courses such as B.Sc Visual Communication is twice that of a B.Com course in the same college.S.Narasimhan, principal, DG Vaishnav College, which is an aided institution, says that irrespective of the number of courses in a college, there must be only one application form. “Students can give their course preference in a single form. Government guidelines also clearly state that colleges must give out applications only after the Class XII results are announced. Students have to be given the chance to make an informed choice.” Higher Education Secretary, K. Ganesan, said that there was no reason for one college to have multiple forms. “Instructions will be issued to all colleges in this regard immediately.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/lsquoApplication-form-season-on/article16298633.ece
1000,No words to explain the exceptional depravity: Judge,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,23:58:57 IST,"The “brutality” of offences committed by Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab, the “depravity” of his mind and his “voluntary” act of becoming a terrorist as per the prosecution's case formed the basis for awarding the death sentence to the lone surviving attacker of 26/11.The special sessions court in its reasoning for the sentence stated: “There is no evidence of mental or emotional disturbance. On the contrary, he [Kasab] appeared to be mentally prepared. The court has taken note that this man [Kasab] voluntarily went to the office of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. No leader took him there. He along with his friend Muzaffar went from place to place without being accompanied by anybody [from Lashkar]. He [Kasab] offered to become a mujahid. He was prepared to face all kinds of training. He refused the option of returning to his relatives' place and preferred to [remain at the training camp]. There is no chance of reformation or rehabilitation of such a person. The way he has committed the offence gives the court no scope for considering his reformation or rehabilitation.”The court rejected the defence argument of moral justification for Kasab's crimes as it found it to be “frivolous.” It also rejected defence lawyer K.P. Pawar's contention that his client was acting under duress and domination of the Lashkar bosses.“Where is the duress,” the court asked. “He and Muzaffar knocked on the door of the Lashkar office. He has shown no duress or domination. Instead, the delay in the attack [upset] him. He was anxious to attack India. He asked the wanted accused [of Lashkar] why there was a delay.”The criterion of young age was rejected by the court in the light of “the aggravating factors as argued by Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam on behalf of the State.”“The murders were committed after previous planning. Not only was there previous planning, but meticulous and systematic planning with all the modern equipment available. All possible precautions were taken to see to it that the attack was a success. The court has accepted Mr. Nikam's argument,” judge M.L. Tahaliyani said.In agreement with the prosecution's argument of unimaginable brutality, the court noted, “[The memory of] brutality was writ large on the faces of the witnesses. When you read the evidence of witnesses at CST [Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus], see the photographs of [photographer] Sebastian D'Souza, I don't think any words are required to describe the brutality. Some witnesses were not even ready to be police witnesses although having seen the incident, and some were not ready to come to court although their statement had been recorded by the police.”Commenting on the incident, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “There are no words to explain the exceptional depravity seen in the initial stages of commission of offence. When he fired indiscriminately, it was without any regard; children and women were killed.”The court also took into consideration that police officers and public servants were “assaulted, injured and killed” by Kasab and his associates.Having listed the observations, Mr. Tahaliyani said, “It is difficult for me to prepare a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The balance is totally in favour of the prosecution.”The court took into account the observations made by the Supreme Court in Bacchan Singh vs. State of Punjab, 1980. However, it noted that the nature of crimes committed by Kasab and the other attackers were not in the sight of the apex court. “The facts of this case are very different. The circumstances are so aggravating that it is impossible to mitigate any of the circumstances.”The judge also drew upon the principles of jurisprudence by jurist Salmond: “To enjoy an effective system of law we have to impose a penalty which [befits] the crime committed by the accused.” Referring to the case of Ankush Maruti vs. State of Maharashtra, he said, “Undue sympathy to give less penalty will do more harm to the justice system.” With reference to the case of Dhananjay Chatterjee alias Dhana vs. State of West Bengal, the court observed the rights of people at large need also to be considered along with the rights of the convict.Mr. Nikam expressed his happiness for the verdict before the media. “Today we have been successful in giving justice to the victims of 26/11 and the departed souls. I also feel relieved on being discharged from Arthur Road jail. We did not fall for the foul games Kasab was trying to play. I think the Crime Branch officers, they deserve all the praise.”Kasab's lawyer on the other hand said he was satisfied with the work he had done. “It was very difficult for me to defend; the evidence was voluminous. I did my job successfully and the court appreciated my efforts. The way I placed my case was the most important thing for me. I could find many good points. It's the court's jurisdiction whether to accept or reject the arguments. I am satisfied with my endeavours,” he said.The court sentenced Kasab to life imprisonment for offences committed under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 307 (attempt to murder), 307 read with 109 (abetment) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 364 (kidnapping or abducting), 121 A (conspiracy to wage war), 122 (collecting arms with the intention of waging war), and Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/No-words-to-explain-the-exceptional-depravity-Judge/article16298877.ece

1002,Kasab sentenced to death,Rahi Gaikwad,2010-05-06,23:08:13 IST,"Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab “shall be hanged by neck till he is dead.”Pronouncing these words, the Special Sessions Court here on Thursday sentenced to death the lone surviving gunman of the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.Kasab was given the death penalty on five counts: murder, abetment to murder, waging war, criminal conspiracy and committing terrorist acts.He was also awarded life imprisonment on five counts: attempt to murder in furtherance of a common intention, kidnapping and abducting in order to murder, conspiracy to wage war, collecting arms with the intention of waging war and causing explosion thus endangering life and property.‘
Aapko char offences ke liye sazaye maut di jaati hai. [You have been sentenced to death for four offences],' Judge M.L. Tahaliyani told Kasab after he read out the order.“You have been given the death penalty for murdering Indian citizens, police officers, conspiring with Lashkar leaders and committing terrorist acts. The court has said while giving the judgment that you shall be hanged unto death,” Mr. Tahaliyani told Kasab. While the sentence was being read out, Kasab sat still, his face sunk deep in the cup of his palm. He listlessly waved when asked by the court to give an opinion on his sentencing. Anxiety drew him to ask for water and he had to be taken out of court. “
Shukriya saab [Thank you, sir],” was all the 26/11 convict could say on his way out of the courtroom.The court wholly accepted the prosecution's arguments for awarding the death sentence, noting that the “aggravating circumstances” fully outweighed the “mitigating circumstances.” It found that the defence could not make out a case for the lesser punishment of life.“In my opinion, the circumstances demand that death penalty be imposed in this case. The court has no option but to impose death sentence. This man has lost the right of getting humanitarian treatment,” the court observed.The court also referred to the Kandahar hijack incident triggered by the presence of the accused in the custody of the Government of India. Mr. Tahaliyani noted, “By keeping such a person alive there would always be a danger hanging over the government. He is a constant danger. He is a menace to society. He has no right to live.”The Indian Penal Code Sections under which Kasab has been given death penalty are: 302 (murder), 302 read with 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war), 302 read with 34 (common intention) and 302 read with 109 (abetment) read with 120 B.In addition, he has been given death for the offence punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. For the other offences, he was awarded rigorous imprisonment, simple imprisonment and imposed with fines.Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told reporters that a confirmation of the death penalty from the Bombay High Court was awaited. Kasab would continue to be housed at the high security Arthur Road jail till further orders by the government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Kasab-sentenced-to-death/article13797884.ece

Krishna, with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi during SAARC summit in Thimpu. Krishna told the Rajya Sabha that he will call up Qureshi on Friday to discuss bilateral ties.
  Setting the ball rolling for the resumption of dialogue with Islamabad, Minister for External Affairs S.M. Krishna on Thursday announced that he would speak to his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi soon after the end of the Parliament session on Friday.Mr. Krishna is expected to discuss the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Qureshi as well as between the two Foreign Secretaries. These interactions were agreed upon by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani in Thimphu last week to address the trust deficit between the two countries. Subsequently the two Foreign Ministers agreed to get in touch after the end of the ongoing Parliament session.Replying to clarifications in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Mr. Krishna was positive about the prospects of the two countries normalising their relations in the light of free and frank discussions between the two Prime Ministers.“An ideal situation has come about in transforming our relations. The mood, ambience, tone and tenor of the Pakistan Prime Minister were indeed encouraging and the Indian Prime Minister put across our core concern about terrorism.“I am sure in the light of these discussions by the Prime Minsters we are in the right direction in trying to create trust and harmony. I am sure that ultimately the whole region will stand to benefit from the thaw with Pakistan,'' he said.The Foreign Minister said the first steps towards reducing the distrust quotient by holding talks between the principals of the Foreign Ministries were being taken following Pakistan's assurance of “adequately'' meeting Indian concerns on terrorism.A meeting between the Foreign Secretaries in February this year was intended to send the message to the people of Pakistan that India believes in “open door, open communication policy.''Terming the beheading of a Sikh in Pakistan as “heinous and inhuman,'' the Minister pointed to the unequivocal condemnation by its President Asif Ali Zardari and his assurance of providing adequate security in keeping with his declaration of Pakistan being a pluralistic nation.Mr. Krishna said India was involved in reconstruction work in Afghanistan at the request of its government. “It behoves India that whenever such an invitation comes we should go there and do our humble bit…India is not militarily involved and our volunteers have gone there to help Afghanistan to be self-reliant and self-confident. No doubt there are elements not disposed to be happy with cordial India-Afghan relations. We have lost valiant men but let me assure you that our involvement is going to continue and not going to be deterred by such attacks,'' he declared.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Krishna-sets-ball-rolling-on-dialogue/article16298954.ece

Anyone who volunteers for the job can do it. Even if there is no hangman to be found, any police officer from the rank of a constable can also do it if he volunteers,” a Tihar Jail official said.Legally, the government can appoint a hangman either for short-term or as a permanent appointee.“If there is such a problem, it is only temporary. The government can either appoint someone on a short-term basis or permanently. Moreover, any jail official can also do the job if he wishes,” G. Venkatesh Rao, senior Supreme Court lawyer, who was also involved in the Indira Gandhi Assassination case said.It was in 1989 that Satwant and Kehar Singh, convicted in Indira Gandhi Assassination case, were hanged to death.The latest case of execution was of Dhananjay Chatterjee who got the death penalty for murder.Chatterjee was kept at the Alipore Jail for 14 years before his mercy plea was rejected by former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and he was hanged to death on August 14, 2004.He was executed by the 87-year-old hangman Nata Mullick in West Bengal. Mullick, whose father Shibal Mullick was a hangman in the British colonial days, died in December 2009.Major jails across India face an acute shortage of trained hangmen.Only men are employed for this job and the candidate has to be above 5 feet 4 inches tall.Other than the morbid nature of the job, the meagre salary also acts as a deterrent.

  Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday said conviction of Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab proved that the present laws were adequate to deal with the menace of terror. However, the government was open to “revisit” the laws if necessary.Replying to a debate in the Rajya Sabha on the functioning of his Ministry, Mr. Chidambaram said Kasab's conviction was not on the basis of his confession but evidence.The amended Unlawful Activities (Preventions) Act (UAPA) proved adequate for the prosecution and there was no need for separate provisions, as suggested by the BJP. “For the present, laws are adequate.

  On May 9, when people across the country will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, Kolkata-based St. Xavier's School and College will join in the celebrations for its former student, whose association with the institution, though brief, was close to the poet's heart.Though the Nobel laureate strongly disliked the system of institutionalised education — resulting in his being home-tutored for most of his academic years — he studied at the school for almost two years; perhaps his longest stint as a student in any school during his lifetime, and penned down his memories of the period on several occasions.Organised by the Alumnorum Societas and the St. Xavier's College (Cal) Alumni Association, the celebrations will be marked by a recitation of Tagore's ‘Sesher Kobita' (Last Poem) by actor Soumitra Chatterjee and Dhritiman Chatterji in the presence of several noteworthy alumni of the institution.The programme will also coincide with the school's celebration of its 150th year of existence.Tagore was admitted to the fifth standard in 1875, at the age of 14, along with his elder brother Somendranath Tagore and nephew Satyaprasad Gangopadhyay. The St. Xavier's was the fourth and last school he attended before his father decided to home-tutor him.In one of his accounts, Tagore wrote about his disinterest in school education. “I could understand that my value in the civilised society is going down. But I can never connect myself with a school that shuts out life and natural beauty and conjures up frightening images of a prison or hospital,” he had said.His experience at the St. Xavier's School, according to him, was relatively happier. Though most teachers appeared to him as “mere teaching machines,” he was fond of a Jesuit priest, named Father Alphonsus De Peneranda, who had come from Spain and was appointed a part-time teacher.Tagore reminisced in one of his accounts that while most students in Father Peneranda's class were inattentive due to his lack of fluency in English, the poet felt a deep sense of empathy and respect for his teacher.Historians researching Tagore have found out from school records and accounts of his classmates that the school's annual calendar misspelt the poet's name twice as ‘Nobindronath Tagore,' that he failed in the fifth standard, that his roll number was 36, and that he came to school in a horse-drawn carriage.While Tagore left the school in 1877, he came back to his alma mater in 1931 to preside over a function organised by the teachers and students to collect funds for people affected by the devastating floods in Bengal that year.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Tagores-school-to-celebrate-his-150th-birth-anniversary/article16299038.ece

1017,SC upholds Constitutional validity of MPLAD scheme,PTI,2010-05-06,11:07:25 IST,"The Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional validity of the MPLAD scheme under which members of Parliament are allocated Rs two crore annually for development of their constituencies.“We hold that the MPLAD scheme is valid,” a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said in a unanimous verdict.“There is no reason for us to interfere in the scheme,” the bench also comprising Justices R.V. Raveendran, D.K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and J.M. Panchal said.The bench, however, said improvements can be made in the working of the scheme.The bench said the mere allegations that the funds are prone to be misused cannot be a ground for scrapping the scheme.It said that both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have standing committees to monitor the scheme and there are various levels of accountability for its implementation.The apex court said that the scheme has benefited the local area development by way of providing water, electricity, infrastructure, library and sports facilities.It rejected the contention of the opponents of the scheme that it gives an unfair advantage to the sitting MPs against their political rivals.The bench said there is no reason to believe that the MPLADS cannot be implemented and monitored by the district authorities. The scheme is for the public interest and public purpose.The court said it was satisfied that under the scheme, there is no violation of separation of power.Interpreting Articles 282 of the Constitution, the bench said that Parliament validly holds power to disburse funds for the scheme.The scheme had come under judicial scrutiny after a sting operation in 2005 showed some MPs allegedly demanding money from contractors to award work for projects under MPLAD scheme. The expose had led to the expulsion of members from both Houses of Parliament.The MPLAD scheme had been in the news in 2006 due to allegations that trusts run by the then Election Commissioner Navin Chawla’s family got funds from the scheme.A three—judge bench on July 12, 2006 had referred the matter to a five—judge Constitution Bench observing that important questions of law needed to be settled.The scheme was first challenged in 1999 by Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party Chief Bhim Singh and an NGO, Common Cause, alleging that in the absence of any guidelines, the funds allocated under the scheme were misused by MPs.Later, petitions were also filed in various high courts and on the Centre’s intervention all the petitions were transferred to the apex court.Attorney General G E Vahanvati, who was then Solicitor General, had submitted that MPLAD Scheme is also a welfare measure implemented with the assistance of the local authorities like other schemes Jawahar Rozgar Yojna, Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme and Integrated Child Development Scheme.The funds under the MPLAD (Member of Parliament Local Area Development) Scheme were directly released by the Centre to the district authorities and it did not go directly in the hands of the MP, he had submitted.The Centre had defended the scheme, saying that it had the authority of law to release money under it as funds were withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India by passing the Appropriation Bill.The opponents of the scheme had alleged it was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution (Right to Equality) as it gave arbitrary powers to an MP without there being proper checks and balances, monitoring and accountability regarding the money being spent under it.NGO Lok Sevak Sangh had contended that the scheme gives an unfair advantage to serving MPs over their rival candidates in elections.The NGO had said the powers exercised or enjoyed by the MPs by virtue of MPLAD scheme results in discrimination between various sections of society in allocation of work.It was argued that though there is a provision in the guidelines that an MP who does not want to use his funds may withdraw from the scheme, it has not been done by any of them.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/SC-upholds-Constitutional-validity-of-MPLAD-scheme/article16298679.ece

  The New York Police Department (NYPD), learning lessons from the 26/11 Mumbai attack, has taken necessary steps to prevent any such type of terror attempt, a top US cop said today.“As part of our comprehensive response to what happened in Mumbai, we’ve held tactical drills and tabletop exercises with officers from our Special Operations Division based on that scenario,” New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in his testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.Mr. Kelly had testified before the same committee last year about the NYPD’s response to Mumbai—like terror assault in 2008, which claimed 183 lives.“As you may recall, that attack was carried out by small teams of operatives using AK—56 assault rifles. By sustaining the operation for hours, they maximised the casualties,” he said.NYPD has trained “more than 250 additional officers” in the use of heavy weapons to “supplement” the work of emergency service officers in a crisis.“We’ve also decided to use the instructors in our Firearms and Tactics Unit as another reserve force,” he said, adding that all of its police recruits would now receive basic instruction in three types of heavy weapons.“We’ve taken these and other measures because we believe an attack involving active shooters is always a possibility.Likewise, we must also guard against terrorists armed with homemade bombs, whether a car bomb like the one we saw in Times Square or stashed inside backpacks for a suicide mission like the one planned for last September in New York subways,” Mr. Kelly said.The officer noted that the department’s subway bag search programme is designed to counter terror threats like the 2005 London bombings.Mr. Kelly rued that their undercover operations showed the “ease” with which terrorists can purchase explosive ingredients such as chlorine and ammonium nitrate in the US.“These efforts are part of a robust counter—terrorism programme we built from the ground up in 2002, when we realised that in addition to our focus on crime fighting, the police department needed to build the intelligence collection analysis and infrastructure protection capabilities to defend New York City from another terrorist attack,” Mr. Kelly said.The NYPD had also established the nation’s first municipal counter—terrorism bureau and structured a intelligence division.“We recruited the best that the federal government had to offer to head those two operations,” he said.Similarly, the department had created a new civilian intelligence programme to support field commanders, who have tapped the “incredible” logistic diversity of the police department, with timely information and analysis.“We assigned native speakers of languages such as Urdu, Arabic and Pashtu to counter—terrorism duties. We strengthened our patrol of key infrastructure in the city, including bridges, tunnels and a host of landmarks and other sensitive locations,” Mr. Kelly said while listing out the measures taken after the Mumbai terrorist attack.A team of officials were sent to Mumbai to have first hand information of the terrorist operations there in November—December 2008.“We forged collaborative relationships with the private sector with law enforcement organisations up and down the East Coast and with federal agencies, especially the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security,” Mr. Kelly added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rsquo2611-Mumbai-attacks-help-New-York-police-to-be-better-preparedrsquo/article16298672.ece

The functioning of the Medical Council of India has come to a virtual standstill following the arrest of its president, Ketan Desai, on corruption charges.These amendments are expected to incorporate major changes suggested by the Ministry in the amendment Bill, tabled in 2005, which were turned down by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health.Sources in the Ministry told The Hindu it was keen that the government be able to intervene in the MCI in the “larger public interest” as did the Human Resource Development Ministry in the case of the All-India Council for Technical Education and the University Grants Commission under Section 20 (1) of the AICTE and the UGC Acts though these were nominated bodies. The MCI is an elected body with no such provision for intervention by the Centre. A provision for intervention was turned down by the Standing Committee on the ground that it would seriously jeopardise the independent working of the MCI and decision making of its president and vice-president.

The proposed amendments to the MCI Act — if and as approved by Parliament — will continue until the government takes a final decision on whether medical education should come under the purview of the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) under the HRD Ministry or the National Council for Human Resource in Health being pushed by the Health Ministry.Meanwhile, the NCHER has invited a Health Ministry representative for its final meeting later this week.

From there, he is set to embark on a journey to his birthplace, where prohibitory orders have been issued and security heightened to avoid tribal unrest.Mr. Muivah reached Viswema village, near the Nagaland-Manipur border, on his way home to the Somdal village in Ukhrul district.Escorted by members of the Naga civil society, Mr. Muivah left the NSCN-IM headquarters, Camp Hebron, near Dimapur at noon after a brief prayer and arrived here to a warm welcome at the check gate on the National Highway 39. He was then escorted to the Viswema village, 25 km south of this town.Mr. Muivah was to stay overnight at Viswema, from where he had planned to go to Somdal on Thursday, said the Naga Hoho leaders, who are coordinating Mr. Muivah's entourage.The Nagaland police have provided Mr. Muivah with a bullet-proof vehicle, while security forces have been deployed on the national highway, a senior police officer said.At least 50 vehicles, mostly occupied by members of Naga non-governmental organisations, including women, escorted Mr. Muivah to Viswema.In a hurriedly convened press briefing at the NSCN-IM headquarters on Tuesday night, Mr. Muivah said he would go ahead with his planned visit to his village, which he said was agreed upon by the Centre.“I must go there and no force can stop me. My parents died waiting to meet their son.”He said he failed to understand why Manipur was objecting to his visit, adding: “The opposition to my visit came as a surprise...the visit is for peace, to meet family and friends and not to disturb anyone...We will not claim anything which belongs to the Meiteis [an ethnic group of Manipur], let them have theirs, we will only have what is rightfully ours.”The Manipur government has stepped up security and clamped prohibitory orders on the other side of the Mao inter-State gate to thwart the entry of the Naga leader.The NSCN-IM, one of the oldest and powerful rebel groups in the northeast, has been demanding a ‘greater Nagaland,' which it proposed be formed by merging the Naga-populated areas of adjoining States.

For, this place has been believed to be the birth place of Lord Ram by millions of Hindus for several centuries, senior counsel Ravi Shankar Prasad argued in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court.A Full Bench comprising Justices S.U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D.V. Sharma is hearing final arguments in the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. In the suits pending since 1989 Muslims sought a declaration that the area in dispute be declared a Babri mosque.After the completion of arguments on behalf of the plaintiffs in March, senior Supreme Court lawyer Prasad, representing the interest of Hindu worshippers, who claim as of right worship of the deity of Ram Lalla at Ram Janmasthan at Ayodhya, commenced his arguments on May 3.Mr. Prasad argued that in Hindu ethos and Hindu customary law, duly sanctified for the last thousands of years, “the concept of deity is a very distinguishing feature unlike in other religions. This deity is the manifestation of the Supreme Being which is eternal, permanent and omnipresent. The temple is the home of the god and the idol is a manifestation of the Supreme Being.”Quoting scriptures, he said: “The Hindus' concept of deity can also be shapeless and formless as they worship both Vayu and Agni. Even a log of wood or a piece of stone or the Sangam at Prayag, where — it has been believed by people for generations — a dip in the trinity of three rivers washes one of all sins, has also been exalted to the status of a deity. The Hindu concept is that a deity does not die nor is it subject to decay, and if an idol is stolen or is damaged or is defiled, a new idol installed [at the same place] acquires the antiquity of the old.”Counsel said: “The Ram Janmasthan fully answers the description of a deity held in reverence by the Hindus for the last thousands of years.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lsquoRecognise-right-to-worship-Ram-Lalla/article16298620.ece

Whichever party might conspire with and support the CPI(M), it is useless since the latter has lost all power…these agents of the CPI(M) will eventually realise that the real power rests with the people's grand alliance as those who flee from a battlefield are never respected,” Ms. Banerjee said.The Trinamool chief was speaking at a press conference where Mr. Mukherjee formally announced his decision to quit the Congress and join the Trinamool.Pointing out that her party is a “part and parcel” of the coalition government at the Centre and is committed to the alliance, she claimed that it had always tried to maintain the alliance and had worked hard accordingly.Exuding confidence about her party's prospects in the upcoming civic polls, Ms. Banerjee asserted that Mr. Mukherjee's decision to rejoin the Trinamool was “necessary for history, for change, for the State and its people” and appointed him the party's senior vice-president.Echoing Ms. Banerjee's words, Mr. Mukherjee said he had of late started doubting the Congress' intention of maintaining the alliance and felt “useless” in the party. “The truth is that it was a deliberate attempt to break the alliance. The CPI(M) has a major role behind it ,” he added.After functioning as Mayor of Kolkata under the Trinamool banner, Mr. Mukherjee had left the party and joined the Congress five years ago following differences of opinion with Ms. Banerjee.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Trinamool-committed-to-alliance-Mamata/article16298660.ece

1024,Criminals may benefit but citizens' rights should be protected: Court,J. Venkatesan,2010-05-06,00:08:26 IST,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would be failing in its duty if it permitted any citizen to be forcibly subjected to narco-analysis, brain mapping and polygraph tests in violation of his privacy. Notwithstanding the fact that its judgment would benefit hardened criminals who had no regard for societal values, the court had a constitutional right to protect the rights of citizens.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said: “One of the main functions of constitutionally prescribed rights is to safeguard the interests of citizens in their interactions with the government. As guardians of these rights, we will be failing in our duty if we permit any citizen to be forcibly subjected to these tests.”
Unjustified intrusion
Irrespective of the need to expedite investigations in sensitive cases, no person, who was a victim of an offence, could be compelled to undergo any of these tests. Such forcible administration would be an unjustified intrusion into mental privacy and could lead to further stigma for the victim.“It must be borne in mind that in constitutional adjudication our concerns are not confined to the facts at hand but extend to the implications of our decision for the whole population as well as future generations.”The Bench said: “Forcing an individual to undergo any of these techniques violates the standard of ‘substantive due process' which is required for restraining personal liberty. Such a violation will occur irrespective of whether these techniques are forcibly administered during the course of an investigation or for any other purpose since the test results could also expose a person to adverse consequences of a non-penal nature.”
Inhuman treatment
On the contention that these techniques could be read into the statute within the ambit of ‘medical examination' in the Criminal Procedure Code, the Bench said such an expansive interpretation was not feasible. “It would also amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with regard to the language of evolving international human rights norms. Furthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered from these techniques comes into conflict with the right to a fair trial. Invocations of a compelling public interest cannot justify the dilution of constitutional rights such as the right against self-incrimination.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that a person could make an incriminating statement on being threatened with the prospective administration of any of these techniques. Conversely, a person who has been forcibly subjected to these techniques could be confronted with the results in a subsequent interrogation, thereby eliciting incriminating statements. While the scheme of criminal procedure as well as evidence law mandates interference with physical privacy through statutory provisions that enable arrest, detention, search and seizure, among others, the same cannot be the basis for compelling a person ‘to impart personal knowledge about a relevant fact'.”The Bench said: “It is also quite conceivable that an individual may give his/her consent to undergo the said tests on account of threats, false promises or deception by the investigators. For example, a person may be convinced to give his/her consent after being promised that this would lead to early release from custody or dropping of charges. However, after the administration of the tests the investigators may renege on such promises. In such a case, the relevant inquiry is not confined to the apparent voluntariness of the act of undergoing the tests, but also includes an examination of the totality of circumstances. The questionable scientific reliability of these techniques comes into conflict with the standard of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt' which is an essential feature of criminal law.”
“Only an aid”
The former CBI Director, R.K. Raghavan, welcoming the judgment, said: “These tests are a dubious tool in the hands of the investigator. It [test] has been more romanticised than the real benefit in the investigation. Within my knowledge, it has not served any useful purpose in any major investigation. It is only an aid.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Criminals-may-benefit-but-citizens-rights-should-be-protected-Court/article16298615.ece
1025,All radioactive sources of varsity irradiator accounted for: AERB,R. Ramachandran,2010-05-06,00:04:22 IST,"The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) has identified and accounted for all the cobalt-60 radioactive sources originally present in the gamma cell irradiator of the Chemistry Department of Delhi University.Stating this in a pres release here on Wednesday, the AERB said that the sources would continue to remain in the safe custody of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).It would be recalled that the irradiator, supplied by the Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) in 1968, had been in disuse since 1985 and was auctioned away to scrap dealers on February 26. This had found its way to the metal scrap market of Mayapuri in West Delhi. Without realising that there was a radioactive source in the scrap, two Mayapuri shops where the scrap had finally landed dismantled the equipment and cut open the irradiator into several pieces. This resulted in the people directly involved in the operation and handling the pieces to high doses of radiation. This caused severe radiation poisoning of seven people engaged in the scrap metal business one of whom has since died. The other six continue to battle for life – one at Apollo Hospitals and the rest at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.Following a complete survey of the market, officials of the AERB and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) stated that they located 11 radioactive sources in all — eight from one shop, two from another and one from an individual who was in its possession. Given the badly mangled state of the irradiator and its pieces, it was not clear then whether the 11 sources were all separate sources or were pieces of a single source. These radioactive materials were moved from Mayapuri in mid-April to the Narora Atomic Power Station (NAPS) in U. P.Detailed inspections of the materials recovered were carried out by the AERB officials at NAPS on May 3 and 4 following which the statement was issued. The statement clarifies that all the pieces originated from this single Delhi University gamma irradiator's Co-60 source. This also makes it clear that reports appearing in the media about ‘missing radioactive pencils' and the ‘source trail leading to Rewari (in Haryana)' were incorrect.According to S. K. Malhotra of the DAE, the reconstruction was made possible by the details of the original device that was supplied to the university in 1968, which the AERB managed to obtain from the AECL. Apparently the AECL responded to the query with great efficiency and supplied the details of the sale 42 years ago within a couple of hours. Mr. Malhotra also confirmed the initial activity of the source was over 3,000 curies (Ci). After 42 years, or 8 half-life periods of Co-60, the activity would have dropped by a factor of 2 to the power of 8, or 256, only. (One curie stands for 37 billion radioactive decays/sec.)According to the details provided by the AECL, the source chamber had provision for 54 pencils of Co-60 of which only 16 were occupied at the time of supply based on the requirements specified by the user. Each cylindrical pencil is made of 7 ‘slugs' or pieces of Co-60, each measuring about 2.5 cm x 0.6 cm stacked together and all the pencils constitute a unit that can be placed around any material to be irradiated with gamma rays. The AERB claimed that they were able to account for all the 112 slugs of the 16-pencil Co-60 source unit.In a related development, the Delhi University teachers' Association (DUTA) has demanded an impartial enquiry by the President of India, who is the Visitor of the university, into the callous disposal of the Co-60 source to scrap dealers. In particular, the DUTA has called for a enquiry into the constitution by the vice-chancellor of the committee that authorised its disposal and into the inexplicable silence on the part of the university authorities for as long as 20 days when the Delhi police and the AERB were groping in darkness to hunt down the origin of the radioactive material. “In this context, the speedy work by the Delhi Police in tracking down the origin to the Chemistry Department of Delhi University needs to be commended, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/All-radioactive-sources-of-varsity-irradiator-accounted-for-AERB/article16298577.ece

Doctors who attended on her said measles was the immediate cause for her death. She was admitted to the hospital on Monday. The doctors said Bency had the HIV encephalitis syndrome.The funeral rites will be held at a date to be declared later since the arrival of her maternal uncle is awaited. Together with her HIV-infected brother Benson (13), she was under the care of their blind grandmother at Kaithakuzhy near here. The funeral will be held under the supervision of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society.The body was brought to Kollam later in the eveningto be placed at the mortuary. A spokesman for the AIDS Control Society said a decision on how to handle the dead body before the funeral would be taken by the Society on Thursday. There is no harm in conducting the funeral as per Christian rites, the spokesman has said.Bency and Benson are children of AIDS-infected parents. Their father C.K. Chandy died in 1997 and their mother, Princy, in 2000. At the time Bency was 5 years old and Benson, 3. They then came under the care of their maternal grandparents. Their grandfather Geevarghese passed away in 2006.The siblings were one of the best publicised cases of HIV-positive children being denied access to school. The issue had attracted the attention of even the international media. Attempts by the grandparents to get them admitted in several schools were denied mainly because parents of other students threatened to withdraw their children from the schools if the siblings were allowed to study there.This compelled Geevarghese to undertake a fast in Thiruvananthapuram in 2003, which in turn resulted in the then Chief Minister A.K. Antony, calling a high-level meeting to solve the issue. Initially, a private tutor was appointed at their home and exams were also written separately.Later, as the constant campaign on AIDS awareness began producing results, the siblings were given admission to one of the schools that earlier denied them admission. Bency and Benson were presently studying at the Adichanalur Panchayat High School with other children. Bency was in Class 9 and had been promoted to Class 10.In September 2003, during an interaction with the siblings in Thiruvananthapuram, the then Union Minster for Health and Family Welfare, Sushma Swaraj, hugged them in public in an attempt to dispel myths and the stigma attached to the condition. On that occasion, Ms. Swaraj announced the public-sector Hindustan Latex would meet the educational expenses of the siblings for five years.

1032,Muthalamada ‘mango city' goes hi-tech,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,19:51:55 IST,"Muthalamada in Chittur taluk, known as the ‘Mango city' of the State for its early mango harvest and large-scale export, is going hi-tech in sorting, grading, ripening, packing and export of mangoes.The first modern facility for mango processing and export in the State — Chittur Agro Park — began functioning in Muthalamada last week with technical support from the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bangalore.The Horticulture Mission Kerala has recognised it as a model unit for process and export of mangoes. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has provided financial assistance to set up the Rs. 50-lakh Agro Park. Mango growers can bring their product here and get them sorted, graded, ripened and packed for export or to send it to cities like Mumbai and Delhi for a good price.The Agro Park employs ethylene-based ripening , which is recognised internationally as a safe method for ripening fruits. The Park has ripening and pre-cooling chambers. This mangoes can be kept for three weeks without damage, said Becker Palliparambil, exporter of mangoes to the Gulf countries and the persons behind the new Agro Park.He said four tonnes of mangoes can be ripened at a time. The park will function round the clock during the season to benefit the farmers of Muthalamada and other places.Mango growers here had been using a lot of chemical pesticides to kill fruit flies, which rupture the outer skin of the fruit to lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the pulp of the ripe fruit. Deputy Director of Agriculture Department (Horticulture Mission) Jose Varghese says these insects can be effectively controlled by the new methods used in the Agro Park.At present, calcium carbide is widely used for ripening mango. In this case, the acetylene gas liberated is highly carcinogenic. This has to be strictly avoided. To get more orders and good prices in national and international markets, mango should be organically cultivated and ripened, he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Muthalamada-lsquomango-city-goes-hi-tech/article16298828.ece

1034,100 injured in Kinaloor violence,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,19:48:20 IST,"About 100 people including policemen were injured in a pitched battle between the police and local people at Kinaloor, 24 km from here, on Thursday after several hundred protestors prevented a team of revenue officials from conducting a feasibility survey for a proposed four-lane road to the KSIDC industrial park located on the Kinaloor industrial park.The protestors had blocked the load leading to the estate with large boulders and timber logs in the morning when the officials, led by Revenue Divisional Officer K.P. Remadevi, arrived for the survey. Soon a pitched battle broke out between the protestors and the police and women constables were seen dragging women and children from the frontline of the blockade.The police resorted to a lathicharge to cow down the protestors and they responded by hurling stones at the police. Several protestors including women and at least one child were injured in the lathicharge. Several policemen sustained injuries in stone-throwing. The police used a grenade and teargas to disperse the crowd. They chased the protestors into nearby houses.The residents in the area have been questioning the rationale of laying a four-lane road to the park ever since a Malaysian government agency that had proposed a satellite city at Kinaloor withdrew from the project in September 2008. Also, there are rumours of a ‘land mafia' having purchased large swathes of land at Kinaloor in view of the Malaysian project.The police allegedly damaged a car and a motorbike owned by a persons after he refused to cooperate with policemen searching for fleeing protestors. His daughter told presspersons that the policemen used expletives and behaved in a menacing manner.Thamarassery Deputy Superintendent of Police Kuberan Namboodiri was among those who suffered major injuries. Among the 55 persons who came to the Community Health Centre at Balussery for treatment, 44 were police personnel.A protestor who sustained injuries on his back and left leg said several persons injured in the lathicharge did not seek treatment in hospital for fear of police persecution.The survey resumed after the police managed to disperse the protestors.Meanwhile, a tense situation gripped the area outside the estate when Communist Party of India (Marxist) activists and the protestors regrouped there. This time, the police preferred to watch the situation from a safe distance.The CPI(M) workers alleged that the protest and violence were orchestrated by outside elements. They said the policemen were provoked into lathicharging after the protestors sprayed a solution of cow dung on them.The protestors said they had only convened a Jana Jagrata Samiti on the occasion. “We blocked the team that came for the survey three times earlier. There were policemen then too, but no violence happened. This time, policemen were sent with orders to use force against us,” alleged a protestor.District leaders of the Congress, Indian Union Muslim League, Bharatiya Janata Party and the Solidarity Youth Movement soon arrived at the scene. The situation eased following Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan's orders to stop the survey. The Chief Minister directed the District Collector to submit a report on the incident.

  | Photo Credit: S_K_MOHAN The ongoing agitation by the local residents against a toddy shop at South Bazar here and the counter-protests by toddy tappers reached a flashpoint on Thursday. Irate toddy tappers, led by their union leaders, stormed into the venue of the agitation, destroyed the thatched structure erected by the agitators and opened the toddy shop that had remained closed for over 40 days.The toddy tappers reached the venue in a procession around 11.15 a.m. demanding that the shop, employing 30 toddy tappers, be allowed to function. Police personnel, outnumbered by the toddy tappers, were pushed aside and they remained mute witnesses to what followed.As the toddy tappers gave vent to their wrath, local residents at the venue ran to the safety of a nearby house. The workers then opened the toddy shop and measured the toddy brought there. The incident occurred after Sarvodaya Mandalam leader Thayat Balan inaugurated the fast by a resident expressing solidarity with the agitation.
Some injured
The agitators alleged that four women were injured in the assault by the toddy tappers. The union leaders claimed that a toddy tapper was also injured. A policeman also suffered injuries in the melee.The agitation began on March 23 when a group of local people came out against the shifting of the toddy shop from an old rented building to a new building, hardly 10 metres away, purchased by the co-operative society running the toddy shop. All efforts for a settlement came to naught as the agitators insisted that the toddy shop, which has been in the area for 42 years, will not be allowed in the locality.
Question of livelihood
The toppy tappers' union leaders said that the workers were just asserting their right to do their job. They claimed that the agitators refused to attend meetings to discuss alternatives. The workers could not be afford to be onlookers when they were denied their right to livelihood, they added.Kerala Madya Nirodhana Samiti activist T.P.R. Nath, who was at the venue of the agitation when the workers went berserk, said the agitators would discuss with supporting organisations the future course of action.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Toddy-tappers-agitators-clash/article16298825.ece

  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised to refer to an expert panel Kerala's plea for conferring ‘classical' status to Malayalam.The Prime Minister, who gave a patient hearing to the delegation led by Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy, Culture Minister M.A. Baby and poets O. N. V. Kurup, Sugathakumari and K. Satchidanandan, said while Kerala appeared to have a strong case, it was for experts to decide on the State's plea.“The Prime Minister gave us a warm welcome and patiently listened to our arguments. We are hopeful that this initiative by the Culture Minister and the State government would produce a positive outcome,” O.N.V. Kurup told The Hindu here on Thursday evening.“This is a very significant initiative by the Culture Minister which was long overdue. We look forward to some change. We will also continue to strive for securing classical language status for Malayalam,” added Sugathakumari.A language is accorded classical status if it is at least 1,000 years old, has a rich a literature and an independent literary tradition. Malayalam is the only South Indian language that has not been accorded classical status.“We are not asking for any relaxation in the criteria because we are confident that Malayalam does fulfil all the criteria. What we ask for is patient consideration of our arguments which, we are confident, no independent minded panel would be able to reject,” said O.N.V. Kurup.
Submits memorandum
In the memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister, the delegation pointed out that Malayalam had developed sufficiently much earlier than 12th century.Malayalam, the memorandum said, is as ancient as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada as it belonged to the Proto Dravidian family of languages. It was the language of the ancient ‘Chera' Kingdom, which underwent gradual transition like its sister languages, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu. For long, the word ‘Tamil' was a synonym for the word language. ‘In fact this served as a misty curtain to hide the antiquity of Malayalam Language,' the memorandum said and added that it was significant that Malayalam versions and commentaries of Sanskrit works were mentioned as ‘Tamil Kuttu' (Tamil book), an important example being the Malayalam annotation of the famous Sanskrit Lexicon, ‘Amarakosham' which was mentioned as ‘Amaram Tamill Kuttu'.The first available work in Malayalam, ‘Ramacharitham,' was proof of a rich heritage of poetic culture. Further, the present Malayalam script ‘Granthalipi' can be found in ancient Kerala writings from as far back as 9th century AD, it said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Panel-to-go-into-Keralas-appeal/article16298933.ece

Achuthanandan led an all-party State delegation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh here on Wednesday and urged him to reduce the requirement for right of way (RoW) for National Highway (NH) development projects in the State to 30 metres from the proposed 45 metres.The delegation opposed the implementation of the projects in the State on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis as this would lead to collection of toll. The delegation wanted the Centre to invest in the NH projects directly. It sought adequate rehabilitation and resettlement packages for the evictees. They pointed out that in many stretches land was being acquired only on one side of the road and not in equal measures on either side. A width of 45 metres was too heavy a demand in a densely populated State like Kerala (with a population density of 819 per sq km). Moreover, religious institutions and historical monuments needed to be protected.Later, the Chief Minister told journalists that the Prime Minister had agreed to consider the request. He said that over 15 lakh people would get affected if the highways were expanded to 45 metres. There were lots of agitations and police actions which made the government to rethink on the subject after an all-party meet.Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy said the Congress, in principle, was not against the BOT package for NH 47 and NH 17. But the Centre had initially agreed to expand the highways with its own funds, he said.The delegates also urged the Centre to move the Supreme Court to get the stay given by the Karnataka High Court on night traffic on NH 67 and NH 212 connecting Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, vacated.Regarding the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, the delegates told the Prime Minister that though Kerala was committed to adopting the national pattern, it required some time. The Centre should extend funding to the State under the project without insisting on a change in the age of entry to school immediately. “As a transition management measure, the State may be allowed to convert Class I as pre-primary and the Centre may finance the expenses involved,” they said promising that in due course the age of entry would be changed to six.On the Kochi Metro project, the delegation sought early Central clearance with the participation of the Centre with the requisite external funding. They want this to be implemented on the Delhi metro formula and pointed out that the Centre need to spend only Rs.450 crore on the Kochi project.Among others, Ministers C. Divakaran, N.K. Premachandran, Jose Thettayil, Kadannappaly Ramachandran, K.P. Rajendran, M. Vijayakumar, and M.A. Baby, MPs M.I. Shanavas (Congress), Jose K. Mani (Kerala Congress-M) and E.T. Mohammed Basheer (IUML), RSP State secretary V.P. Ramakrishna Pillai and BJP State president V.

1038,Luck by chance,Nita Sathyendran,2010-05-06,16:02:09 IST,"Deal or No Deal
  | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT I
n the few months since it has been on air, Surya TV's game show ‘Deal or No Deal' appears to have come up trumps for its exciting format, suspense factor, remarkable participants, glamorous models (who hold the cases with the money) and of course most of all, its affable host – actor Mukesh. ‘Deal or No Deal,' which recently completed 50 episodes and which airs on the weekends at 19.30, hinges on the decision-making ability of the contestants. The contestants have to figure out whether to call the deal offered by the banker or override the deal and continue playing for possible higher stakes. Mukesh, who is revelling in his second avatar as a game show host after his stint in ‘Kodeeswaran,' talks about the show to Friday Review. Excerpts from an interview…
Different formats of ‘Deal or No Deal' are aired in over 73 countries and perhaps in as many languages. What is different about the Malayalam version?
Apart from me, you mean? (Laughs). Just kidding. Actually, it is the participants who make the show the success that it is.They are simply superb. They are people with fascinating stories of life. They come from all walks of life – from fisher folk to teachers to scientists and what not, but what makes each of them so special is that they don't come here for the money or fame. Instead they come here to change their lives, change perspectives. For them winning money is secondary.
Change their lives, perspectives?
Well, for instance, in an episode there was a woman from Neyyatinkara who came on the show with her infant son with the hope that her missing/estranged husband would see the bubbly youngster and then want to come back home to them. Then again there was an 18-year-old who came on the show to request me to tell his father, a stonemason, that he (the father) should not spend his entire savings on alcohol.Likewise myriad such stories. The more I host the show the more I realise that it is all about human relationships.
What is your biggest challenge as the anchor?
Since there is a lot of one-to-one interaction between the contestants and myself, I have to constantly think on my feet. There is no script and you can never know what the contestants will ask/say. That's where my experience in mimicry, theatre, films and with life itself comes in handy.
How different is this stint as an anchor?
Being the host of ‘Kodeeswaran' gave me the confidence that I can do this one too. This time around, though, it is much more physically and mentally taxing.In ‘Kodeeswaran' I was comfortably ensconced in a chair asking predetermined questions and only crack a joke or two in between. Here I have to stand throughout the show and help contestants make their decisions on whether to deal or not to deal.
How do you help contestants make their decisions on something that appears to have more to do with luck than logic?
Actually luck only comes in the initial phase of the game. Once you go ahead its all about making the right decision at the right time. Of course, it is up to the contestant to deal or not to deal but I can be their support system and explain the pros and cons.

Veerappa Moily, replying to the debate on the Bill, said the Centre did not show haste in passing the Bill. Earlier, T.R. Baalu (DMK) said the Council was being revived in accordance with DMK's election manifesto in 2006.It was abolished by the MGR government with a political motive, he said, adding that Council could accommodate scholars, teachers, elders and other public figures for providing advice to the government.But M. Thambidurai (AIADMK) said the Bill was brought with a political motive to accommodate some persons as it was sure that the AIADMK was going to capture power in Tamil Nadu in 2011 Assembly poll.He said the Council was a symbol of British legacy and its revival was a retrograde step.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Parliament-nod-for-Council-Bill/article16298959.ece

  Responding to a request from Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the Centre has allotted an additional 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice and 65,000 tonnes of wheat to the State.Replying to Peter Alphonse (Congress), Mr. Karunanidhi informed the Assembly on Thursday that he had made the request in the morning in New Delhi. “By the time I returned to Chennai in the evening, the order for the allotment had already reached Chennai.”Earlier, Food Minister E.V. Velu said the State normally received 2.96 lakh tonnes of rice from the Centre each month. Of this just over 65,000 tonnes was meant for distribution to Anthyodaya Anna Yojana families. This rice was supplied to Tamil Nadu at Rs.3 a kg. Another 1.04 lakh tonnes was given at Rs.5.65 a kg for Below Poverty Line families.For the remaining, the State paid Rs.8.35 a kg, which was the open market rate for rice supplied by the Centre (for 1.26 lakh tonnes). This was for above poverty line families. But, the intake had gone up, possibly because of the Re.1 a kg scheme of the government.The demand now stood at 3.17 lakh tonnes a month, he said, and added that this meant a significant deficit, which totalled to over 2.3 lakh tonnes per annum. The Centre had now allocated 2.5 lakh tonnes.Answering a question, Transport Minister K.N. Nehru said that the government was inclined to reduce the educational qualification for drivers from Class 10 to Class 8.
Order soon
An order to this effect would be issued shortly.The Minister said even for posts of government and transport corporation drivers it was not easy to find those who had completed Class 10.

  The Madras High Court has directed the State government to take up enumeration of heritage buildings in Tamil Nadu that have been listed in the report filed by the Justice E.Padmanabhan Committee.Allowing a writ petition filed by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), a Bench comprising Justices Prabha Sridevan and P.P.S.Janarthana Raja said that immediate direction must be passed to protect all such buildings/places in the State, wherever they may be and cited as an example the 150-year-old Kuthirai Vandi Court in Coimbatore that has become home to anti-social elements .The Bench restrained Life Insurance Corporation of India from demolishing the Bharath Insurance building without complying with regulation 22 of the Development Control Rules for the Chennai Metropolitan Area, 2004.
Directive to HCC
It has directed the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) to assess the value and feasibility of retaining the Bharath Insurance building. “As far as possible the building must be saved.The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and the Chennai Corporation, with the consultation of the HCC, shall issue directions for the protection of the building,” the judges said.The Bharath Insurance building, situated on Anna Salai, is an example of Indo-Saracenic architecture.Work on the construction of the building began in 1894 and it was inaugurated in 1897 as Kardyl Building, headquarters of ‘W.E.Smith & Co Ltd.'In 1934, it was sold to Bharath Insurance by Spencer's. Later, when life insurance was nationalised, the building and the company were taken over by the LIC.In 1998, the LIC initiated a process of eviction of tenants in the building on the grounds that it was unsafe for occupation due to its dilapidated condition.The HCC has been asked to recommend to the government steps to notify buildings listed by it as heritage buildings and within three months, cause notices to be issued to the concerned, especially the private owners, in respect of buildings listed by the Justice E.Padmanabhan committee so that there is no threat of demolition of destruction or alteration to such buildings.The Bench has asked the State government to issue rules to prevent persons from undertaking any repair, even in the name of renovation of heritage buildings without seeking the necessary approval of the HCC.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Restraint-on-demolition-of-heritage-building/article16298583.ece

1047,"Prime accused absconding, 23 convicted in Bathani Tola massacre case",Shoumojit Banerjee,2010-05-06,20:07:25 IST,"A local court on Wednesday convicted 23 people for perpetrating the horrific massacre of 21 Dalits at Bathani Tola in Bhojpur in 1996.However, as with the April 7 verdict on the 1997 Laxmanpur-Bathe massacre, the notorious supremo of the Ranvir Sena and the prime accused - Brahmeshwar Singh “Mukhiya” - has been pronounced an “absconder” by the police along with five others in this case as well.A total of 53 people faced trial, out of which 30 were acquitted. The quantum of the judgement is to be pronounced on May 12.The carnage took place on the afternoon of July 11, 1996, when upper-caste landowners of the Ranvir Sena (a private militia of the landlords) stormed Bathani Tola in Bhojpur’s Sahar block and ruthlessly hacked 21 Dalits to death.The slain included women, teenage girls and babies less than 10 months old.An FIR was lodged against 33 people the day after the massacre. In all, the Bhojpur police framed charges against 63 persons in October 1996.The case was committed to the court of the Sessions judge on January 24, 1998, with charges being framed against 62 accused (one person had died by that time) on March 24, 2000.However, after the Central Bihar caste massacres violently concluded with the Mianpur carnage, the case against Brahmeshwar has been getting progressively murkier, with the police repeatedly failing to bring charges against the Mukhiya.Listed as an “absconder” by the Sahar police since 1996, no FIR, quite inexplicably, has ever been registered by the police against Brahmeshwar till date.The Mukhiya continues to be a non-FIR accused even after he was nabbed from Patna’s Exhibition road on August 29, 2002.While the government dithers on Brahmeshwar’s case fearing an upper-caste backlash this crucial election year, highly sceptical ponderings which surfaced soon after the Bathe verdict, are slowly turning into a cruel certainty in what is being constituted as “an open cover-up” on part of the government in Bhojpur judicial circles.“It is hard to fathom as to what is preventing the police and the government in bringing to book this criminal, who has been lodged in Ara jail since 2002,” said Special Public Prosecutor Mr. Rambabu Prasad, speaking to The Hindu from Ara. “This clearly shows that both the police and the government are not interested in ensuring that justice is meted out.”When questioned, the SP Bhojpur told this correspondent that Brahmeshwar did not stand trial as “certain court proceedings initiated against him were yet to be completed.”With the police’s failure to produce the “Butcher of Bathani Tola” in the Patna Sessions Court on April 7, a disturbing aspect of the case has been the repeated feigning of “confusion” on its part as to the status of Brahmeshwar’s investigation.The police has also conveniently the blamed the prosecution for failing to serve them notice regarding Brahmeshwar’s location.An absurd pretext, given that practically everyone in Bihar knows the Mukhiya to be safely ensconced in Ara jail for the last 8 years and counting.Meanwhile, Mr. Prasad said that he has filed a petition in the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Ara on April 19, urging the case against Brahmeshwar to be committed to the Sessions court.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Prime-accused-absconding-23-convicted-in-Bathani-Tola-massacre-case/article16298833.ece
1048,Jaipur hospital conducts successful bariatric surgery,Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,20:03:21 IST,"Doctors at Fortis Escorts Hospital here have performed the first single-incision bariatric surgery in north India to treat a 31-year-old woman for obesity. The surgery for weight loss left only one scar and also treated the patient's related disorders such as acidity, insomnia, snoring and high cholesterol.Ajay Sharma, gastro-intestinal surgeon, said here on Thursday that the new laparoscopic surgery reduces the risks of infection, speeds up healing and helps reduce post-operative pain. The specialised surgical procedure was conducted here this past week for the first time in any northern State.A few attempts made for the single-incision surgery in Delhi had earlier failed. Dr. Sharma said the surgical technique required surgeons to learn specialised skills to perform the operation through a solitary incision against four or more in the traditional surgery, in which each incision has the potential to become infected and cause pain.Dr. Sharma said the woman patient weighed 98 kg and her body mass index (BMI) was 41 against 27 for a normal person. She did not get any relief from the regular yoga, diet control and fat loss medicines consumed for quite some time.Doctors at the hospital conducted tests such as sonography, liver function, thyroid and hormone profiles on the woman and concluded that her obesity could be controlled by bariatric surgery. A single 2.5-mm incision was made in the abdomen during the operation and the patient fully recovered within three days without any stitch marks or scars.Besides the removal of fat in the minimally invasive surgery, a portion of the stomach was detached to decrease the food intake and reduce the release of hormones responsible for deposition of fat. Dr. Sharma said the woman lost seven kg within 12 days and resumed her daily routine.The single-incision surgery was earlier performed at Fortis Escorts Hospital for gallbladder, appendix and hernia. Dr. Sharma said more weight loss surgeries though single-incision had been planned during this month after the first successful bariatric operation.Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gradually gaining ground in several other areas of medicine as well. For the obese people, the procedure leads to long-term loss of weight, recovery from diabetes, improvement in cardiovascular risk factors and a reduction in mortality.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Jaipur-hospital-conducts-successful-bariatric-surgery/article16298832.ece

The INLD had drawn the attention of the election office to the fact that with the notification for holding the municipal elections on May 20 issued on April 26, the Code of Conduct had become immediately effective. Therefore no transfer of officials should have been made after the notification without the approval of the Election Commission.However, the Government had transferred O.P. Sheoran, Deputy Commissioner of Palwal, to Hisar as Deputy Commissioner. Dr. Bangar said this “transfer became even more critical in view of the fact that only a few days earlier Mr. Sheoran had been transferred from Hisar to Palwal. The latest transfer orders after the notification of the elections are obviously motivated with the intention of favouring the ruling party and also vitiating the peaceful atmosphere of Hisar''.He charged that in the past too the Bhupinder Singh Hooda regime had been misusing government funds to further the interests of the ruling party. This practice of using government machinery and funds continued unabated in view of the municipal elections. He accused the State Public Relations Department of “releasing advertisements to various magazines and journals with the intention of winning support during the polls''.The INLD has urged the State Election Commissioner to seek a report on all the advertisements that had been released by the Public Relations Department after the elections were notified and urged him to stop such release of funds immediately.The party has also brought to the notice of the State Election Commissioner a public notice published in a newspaper on May 5 informing the public that the Transport Department would issue 1,714 new permits and launch 860 new routes.The spokesman said this was a serious violation of the model code .The Election Commission has also been apprised of enrolment of bogus voters in Kurukshetra and Faridabad and action has been sought against the Deputy Commissioners/ Municipal Commissioners as the case may be.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/INLD-accuses-Hooda-Govt.-of-trying-to-influence-voters/article16298831.ece

One IG, two DIGs and an SP, thoughtlessly without planning, sent 76 troops for recce,” Mr. Chidambaram said, addressing students at a seminar in the Jawaharlal Nehru University, here on Wednesday nightHe said the setback meant that the country was confronting an adversary who is organised in strength.Later talking about developmental issues, Mr. Chidambaram said, “Dantewada has a police station which has only two policemen. When a policeman does not want to go there, how can you expect a teacher or a BDO to go there.”The Minister said that extreme ideology can be propagated in India. “Speech and propagation is free in a democracy but when they take up arms, the conflict arises.”He said there was no confusion about the aim of the Naxals. “The aim is seizure of political power with armed struggle. That is acceptable under certain conditions. Countries under colonialism took this path. Even India saw armed struggle to overthrow British.“There are situations when you are agitated or frustrated. I represent a backward constituency. Development has just started pouring in. If everybody has a justified right to take up arms, what will happen to the country?”He said the debate regarding whether development or police action should take place first in naxal-affected areas is “metaphysical.”“In West Midnapore, police action is needed first. In Gadchiroli, the district has been secured by security forces. Orissa is in a mixed stage, we have progressed in Jharkhand. It is a chicken and egg argument.“Maoists know development is a threat to them, so they demolish schools, 71 schools were blown up in 2009, they mine roads and blow up bridges. Villagers are killed in the name of being informers.... So to say Maoists are pro-development is a very naive argument,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Dantewada-operation-was-lsquothoughtlesslyrsquo-planned-Chidambaram/article16298795.ece

Thakur said that separate police teams had been deployed at rail stations and bus stands as security measures were intensified in the wake of the shutdown.Railway sources further said that all long distance trains will be escorted by pilot trains while directives had been issued to limit the speed of express and mail trains to 75 Km/hr.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/Maoists-damage-rail-tracks-burn-buses-in-north-Bihar/article16298830.ece

1057,Super Eight: England beat Pakistan by six wickets,S. Dinakar,2010-05-06,22:50:17 IST,"England's Kevin Pietersen, left, is congratulated by teammate Tim Bresnan after he took the catch to dismiss Pakistan's batsman Umar Akmal during their Twenty20 Cricket World Cup match in Bridgetown on Thursday.
  Kevin Pietersen is light on his feet and heavy with his strokes. He waltzed at the crease here on Thursday with shots that were both graceful and inventive.The smooth-stroker was unbeaten with a 52-ball 73 as England won the first Super Eights duel of the ICC World Twenty20 by six wickets with three deliveries to spare.Chasing 148 after inserting Pakistan, England, guided by Pietersen's brilliance, managed to nail a potentially hazardous chase on a lively pitch. The innings was well-paced; only two runs were required in the final over.Earlier, paceman Stuart Broad and left-arm spinner Michael Yardy impressed as Pakistan was pegged back when poised for a surge. England, however, was let off the hook by Pakistan's sloppy catching.Saeed Ajmal grassed a regulation offering at mid-on after appearing to have the ball in control to reprieve opener Craig Kieswetter (on zero) off paceman Abdul Razzaq. Then, Ajmal put down Michael Lumb (on 23), left-arm speedster Mohammed Aamer being the bowler to suffer.And Razzaq failed to latch on to a return catch when Pietersen was on 21. It proved a costly lapse.After Kieswetter and the more fluent Lumb had powered England to a strong start - the openers put on 44 in 5.4 overs - Pietersen took charge.Crucially, he forced the Pakistani bowlers to alter their length. He danced down the track to convert the length to drive, loft, flick and glance both the pacemen and the spinners.He won the crucial duel against leg-spinner Shahid Afridi; the on-the-walk strike over cover reflected his urge to dominate. The manner in which Pietersen, using his feet, clipped Afridi displayed his balance and timing.Indeed, Pietersen was at his fluent best. The lofted six over long off - against the spin - off off-spinner Ajmal was high on the scale of difficulty.Paul Collingwood batted smartly, rotating the strike. England lost its skipper and Eoin Morgan towards the end but then Pietersen had inflicted too much damage for his side to be in any trouble.Earlier, Pakistan started in an emphatic manner with Kamran Akmal pulling the first ball of the match - from left-armer Ryan Sidebottom - over the ropes.The dangerous Akmal dazzled briefly before Broad, extracting good bounce from the pitch, consumed the batsman on the hook. Meanwhile, the left-handed Salman Butt, drove, sliced and flicked to the delight of the Pakistani supporters. Off-spinner Graeme Swann, a quality bowler, deceived Butt in the flight to terminate a promising innings.Yardy, quicker through the air with his left-arm spin, took out Mohammed Hafeez with a change of pace.Off the very next ball – it was the 11th over of the innings – Afridi set out for a non-existent single to cover only to be sent back by Umar Akmal. The Pakistan captain could not regain his crease. England had struck a body blow.Umar Akmal, a naturally free-stroking batsman, produced a few sparkling shots but Pakistan continued to lose wickets. Misbah-ul-Haq fell to an attempted reverse sweep off Yardy. And Umar fell to a sensational catch from Pietersen at deep mid-wicket when he attempted to muscle a short ball from Sidebottom. Pietersen, running with his back to the ball, anticipated to perfection.It was his afternoon at the Kensington Oval. Pietersen was rightly adjudged Man of the Match.

Brief Scores:

Pakistan: 147 for nine in 20 overs (Salman Butt 34, Umar Akmal 30; Michael Yardy 2/19, Stuart Broad 2/25, Ryan Sidebottom 2/28).England: 148 for four in 19.3 overs (Kevin Pietersen 70 not out, Michael Lumb 25, Craig Kieswetter 25; Saeed Ajmal 2/15).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Super-Eight-England-beat-Pakistan-by-six-wickets/article16299035.ece
1058,"India, Australia set for Super Eights showdown",S. Dinakar,2010-05-06,20:38:19 IST,"A confident India face a stern test when they square up against Australia in their first Super Eights clash in the World Twenty20.
  The ball flew around at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday. There was good carry for the pacemen and the bounce assisted the spin bowlers too.This suggests strong back-footed players who can unleash the horizontal bat shots and those with hands that can harness the pace on the ball could be among the runs at the famous Kensington Oval.The venue that oozes character - cricket is very much in the air in these parts - will be the stage for the crucial Super Eights clash between India and Australia on Friday.The cricketers will not be short of inspiration. The immortal Garfield Sobers enclosure stands sentinel over the ground. It will be a big game for both sides. The side, which loses the first match will, in all probability, be under tremendous pressure to win its next two encounters.Much could hinge on how the Indian top-order fares against the Australian pace battery. If Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes can be prevented from making the early inroads, India can win.Tait and Nannes form the quickest new ball combination in the competition. This is a pair of contrasts that blends well. Tait, the high velocity slinger, complements Nannes, the sharp and skiddy left-armer.Will the influential Mitchell Johnson recovers in time from an elbow injury to his non-bowling right arm. If Johnson does not play, Ryan Harris, deceptively quick, will retain his place.The Aussie gameplan will be simple - use the short-pitched deliveries to disrupt the footwork of the Indian batsmen.Tait and Nannes are likely to rely on short-pitched stuff - while only one bouncer per over is allowed, the paceman can bowl any number of deliveries that forces the batsmen to fend off rib-cage – and push the men facing them to the back-foot.They can then strike with searing yorkers. This is a ploy that has worked against India in the past. Once the Aussies score early, then the spinners, including leggie Steven Smith, could be able to bowl under less stress.In a morning match – the game starts at 9.30 a.m. local time – toss will be a factor. The side that bowls first – there will be some moisture on the surface – could starts with an advantage.Openers Gautam Gambhir and Murali Vijay, a left-right pair, face a daunting task. However, the fact that both of them can play the cut and the pull might enable them to counter-attack. Yes, the Indian batsmen will have to disrupt the length of the Aussie pacemen.The in-form Suresh Raina and his ability vis a vis the short-pitched stuff will be under the scanner. He has to remove the question mark against his name when it comes to a particular form of attack. He occupies the vital No. 3 slot.Yuvraj Singh can meet fire with fire, respond with furious hooks and pulls. The mercurial left-hander appears to be getting his confidence back.India has depth in its ranks with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni capable of orchestrating remarkable turnarounds. Yusuf Pathan can strike the ball hard and long too but he could be probed with a barrage of short-pitched deliveries.Australia, though, lacks a specialist fifth bowler. The Indians would be looking at an opportunity here. The Indian bowlers will be in with a definite chance on this surface.Australia has firepower in its batting but then its top and middle-order came apart against Bangladesh before the cool and calculative Michael Hussey came up with a worthy innings under adverse circumstances.For India, left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan should be back in the attack and the bounce will enhance his cut off the wicket. Ashish Nehra, another left-armer, has been bowling a mean length at the death.Bowling in the end overs has been an area of concern for the Indians but Nehra has been operating with heart and tact.And Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla could pose searching questions to the Aussie line-up. The spinners could be among the wickets as well.The wicket of the imposing Shane Watson would the key strike for India at the top of the order. If Watson thrives with his big drives and pulls, India could be in real trouble.India suffered an injury setback when paceman Praveen Kumar was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament with an abdominal tear. Praveen will be replaced by Vidarbha paceman Umesh Yadav.
The teams: India (from): M.S. Dhoni (captain), G. Gambhir, M. Vijay, S. Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Yusuf Pathan, P. Chawla, Harbhajan Singh, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer Khan, A. Nehra, R. Jadeja, D. Karthik, Vinay Kumar, R. Sharma.

1060,I was made a scapegoat by ICC: Samuels,IANS,2010-05-06,18:08:50 IST,"West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels feels he was made a “scapegoat” by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as he nears completion of the two-year ban for leaking team information to a bookie.In three days, Samuels will complete his ban from international cricket, and he maintains he did nothing wrong.“I am an honest person. My conscience would not allow me to come back if I knew within myself I had done something wrong,” Samuels was quoted as saying in Sydney Morning Herald.“They (ICC) need to spend time on situations like this; it is delicate and very important because you are dealing with players’ careers.”“When they looked at my case, they used me as a scapegoat, the ICC wanted to make an example out of me when I was never in a position for them to be able to use me as an example. The way they dealt with my case was very unfair,” he said.“I really didn’t have a case; when I went to the hearing I thought it would be just a fair process but it wasn’t like a hearing at all, I was just banned.”Samuels was charged with playing a part in fixing the first One-day international between India and the West Indies in Nagpur January 21, 2007. The allegations led to the ICC asking the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to conduct an investigation.At the disciplinary hearing, the committee considered evidence provided by the ICC’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) and excerpts of a recorded telephone conversation between Samuels and alleged bookie Mukesh Kochchar, which detailed vital match information being leaked by Samuels.Samuels was accused of leaking information like pitch conditions, the West Indies batting order and team strategies.The 29-year-old won’t predict if or when he might appear for the West Indies again but says: “I’ll just let my bat do the talking.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/I-was-made-a-scapegoat-by-ICC-Samuels/article16298789.ece
1061,We can handle Indian spinners: Clarke,PTI,2010-05-06,15:40:55 IST,"Australian captain Michael Clarke
  On the eve of their crucial Super Eights match, Australian skipper Michael Clarke is not unduly worried by the presence of quality spinners in the Indian ranks, saying his batsmen are equipped to negotiate them.“India have got a lot of talent and they are a great side. They have some good spinners. Harbhajan is a world-class bowler. But then every team plays spinners differently and we are not perturbed. We have batsmen who can play spin pretty well. We will see how it goes tomorrow,” Clarke said.India have a flock of spinners in Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja and part-timers Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh who have proved effective in the past.The Aussie skipper though feels that spin bowling would play a big role in the tournament but sees equal opportunities for the fast bowlers and spinners as far as Friday’s clash is concerned.“Spin bowling is going to play a big part in the tournament. We saw in our win against Bangladesh that the spinners turned the ball a bit. So we can anticipate captains use their spin bowlers more often in the Twenty20 format.“The wicket here is good and the ground is wonderful. It is a lot different from the one we played in St. Lucia. But the nature of the wicket would be of no consequence as the result of the match depends on how the bowlers bowl and how the batters bat.“It depends on how the bowlers use the conditions and execute their skills. So, we are not thinking too about the wicket right now,” averred Clarke, adding “a score of 140 to 150 was defendable.”Clarke was satisfied with his team’s performance in the group matches, where Australia kept a clean slate by beating Pakistan and Bangladesh.“In the last two games we have done pretty well. We came back into the match against Bangladesh after losing six wickets for nothing. We are enjoying our cricket at the moment.Clarke said his boys were ready for the showdown in the Super Eights.“We have trained hard and our preparation has been spot on. We will focus on one match at a time and do not want to look too far into the future. We want to keep our game simple and not worry too much about what India could do,” he said.He did not rule out Mitchell Johnson, who missed the game against Bangladesh with a sore elbow, from Friday’s match.“The physio has been working on him. We will take a call on him tomorrow. But I think we have found a good replacement for him in Ryan Harris,” said Clarke.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/We-can-handle-Indian-spinners-Clarke/article16298732.ece
1062,"Australia beat Bangladesh by 27 runs, qualify for Super 8s",PTI,2010-05-06,01:42:10 IST,"Australia produced a clinical performance to beat Bangladesh by 27 runs and qualify for the Super Eight stage of the Twenty20 cricket World Cup here today.The Aussies rode on Michael Hussey’s unbeaten 47 and Dirk Nannes’ four-wicket haul to drew curtains on their group campaign on unbeaten note after having defeated title holders Pakistan by 34 runs in their opening match.Australia now join Pakistan from Group A in the Super Eight stage and will take on India in their opening second round encounter on Friday.Michael Hussey played a sweet little cameo and shared crucial 74 runs with Steven Smith (27 off 18) for the seventh wicket to lift Australia to 141 for seven before Nannes (4/18) produced a breathtaking pace bowling display toNannes was ably supported by David Hussey (2/8) and Smith (2/29) at the middle.Captain Shakib Al Hasan top—scored for Bangladesh with a run-a-ball 28 while wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim (24 off 25) gave him the perfect support from the other end during their 48-run fifth-wicket partnership.Bangladesh made a mockery of their run chase as they lost four of their top-order batsmen inside the first four overs.Needing a outright win inside 19 overs to book their place in the Super Eight stage, the Bangladesh’s did not help their cause in any way and played insensible shots against some fine pace bowling to totter at 16 for four.Shain Tait (1/15)) and Nannes tested the Bangladeshi batters from the onset with their fiery and high quality fast bowling.Nannes, in particular, was the fiercesome of the duo as he picked up Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed and Mahmudullah during his three-over opening spell before returning back to account for the wicket Jahurul Islam (18).Inspite of the early jitters, Shakib and Mushfiqur put up a brave fight during their the fifth wicket to keep Bangladesh in the hunt.Shakib’s innings was finally cut short by a blinder of a catch at deep from Michael Hussey off Smith.Jahurul and Shafiul Islam (16 off 13) tried their level best to dig something out of the game but it was not to be Bangladesh’s day as Australia dished out a fantastic performance on the field to eventually romp home with eight balls to spare.Earlier opting to bat, the Aussies initially struggled as they lost six wickets for mere 65 runs before Hussey and Smith saved the day with the 42-ball vital partnership.After the initial hiccup, the Aussies added 59 runs in the last five overs, courtesy some fine hitting from Hussey and Smith.Australia did not have the ideal start to their innings as Shane Watson (4) feel early with Mashrafe Mortaza (2/28) striking in his second and innings’ third over.Watson mistimed a pull of Mortaza’s well-directed bouncer that landed in the hands of Ahmed.Captain Shakib (2/24) then ensured double celebrations for Bangladesh in the next over, picking up dangerman David Warner (16 off 11), caught by Ahmed.And then few overs later, a reckless shot from Brad Haddin ensured further trouble for Australia. He was easily caught by Shafiul off left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak (1/29) as he went for a lofted sweep over square leg.As if that was not enough, skipper Michael Clarke (16) was the next to depart, caught at long-off boundary by Jahurul off Ashraful (1/24) to see Australia stutter at 54 for four at the halfway mark.It could have been more trouble the Aussies had Jahurul not dropped a David Hussey sitter off Ashraful’s next ball.But Mortaza ensured that Bangladesh did not have to pay heavily for the dropped chance, picking up David Hussey in the next over to mark the departure of half of the Aussie side.Another well-directed bouncer from Mortaza hurried David Hussey into the pull, but the batsman could not control the shot and ballooned it to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur.Cameron White too failed to make any impact as Shakib outsmarted him with a lovely leg-spinner that turned away crashed onto his timbers.With chips down, Michael Hussey and Smith first played sensibly with ones and twos before opening up in the final five overs to take Australia to the fighting total.Michael Hussey took the onus on him to guide the Australia innings and picked up the tempo with a 17-run over off Mortaza. He hit as many as four fours and six during his 29-bal unbeaten stay.Smith too was not far behind as he used his long handle to great affect in the dying stages to register two sixes and a boundary against his name.

Brief Scores:

Australia: 141 for seven in 20 overs (Michael Hussey 47, Steven Smith 27; Mashrafe Mortaza 2/28, Shakib Al Hasan 2/24).Bangladesh: 114 all out in 18.4 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 28, Mushfiqur Rahim 24; Dirk Nannes 4/18).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Australia-beat-Bangladesh-by-27-runs-qualify-for-Super-8s/article16298627.ece

  | Photo Credit: K_Ananthan With campus placements improving and the economy looking up in the “spill-over” days of the recession, one would have thought that those who are about to start their undergraduate course will be happy about this trend and go with the flow.But, the student crowd that thronged The Hindu Education Plus Education Fair 2010, held for the first time in Coimbatore on Wednesday, told an entirely different story. Even with fairly good jobs and quality education in India, the 2,500-odd visitors to the fair stood testimony to the fact that studying abroad still remained a craze.Though the favourites of the day were Information Technology, engineering, biotechnology, management, and animation, there were universities and academies offering courses from dance and aviation to medicine and health studies, which too drew many enquiries. Of the 2,500, there were more than 1,200 students who registered, showing their earnestness about the course and university they were interested in.For such an enthusiastic turnout, the fair with 30-odd stalls comprising universities, educational consultants, and a bank, turned out to be a boon, offering options with many countries, universities, and courses, to choose from. Students and parents had to wait their turn at each stall to talk to representatives.A parent said she had to talk to representatives in most of the stalls because all the participants were genuine and not institutions which were of run-of-the-mill quality.The University of Bradford, the U.K., with its bachelors, masters' and research programmes in health studies, informatics, and life sciences, Birmingham City University, the U.K., with its job-ready vocational programmes in automotive, and mechanical engineering, and Stratford University, the U.S., with its special focus on telecommunications and software engineering, were a big draw.University of Alabama, Huntsville, the U.S., was promoting the two five-year integrated programmes for undergraduates – Mechanical Aerospace Engineering, and Business Management. Representatives of RACUS, a private organisation representing Russian State universities, said the universities were offering medical and dental courses for 20 per cent of the total fee. “The Russian Government bears 80 per cent of the fee for international students,” Maria Postolovskaya, said. Hence, a candidate with only 50 per cent aggregate and with no GRE score could do a course in medicine, dentistry, business management, or engineering, in a Russian State university.Just like any other stall, eager parents swarmed the stall put up by State Bank of India (SBI) keen to know about the education loans available for students going abroad.S. Venkataraman, Regional Manager, Region I, SBI, said for students going abroad the loan amount went up to Rs. 20 lakh at 11.75 per cent interest. “This will be given against a collateral. Students get a grace period of a year on completion of the course. After that they are given a seven-year repayment period,” he said. Many walked out with the options they needed to make the right decisions to join the bandwagon of Indians studying abroad.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Ardour-for-going-abroad-for-higher-studies-still-in-vogue/article16298590.ece

1067,"Water supply erratic, say residents",Special Correspondent,2010-05-06,00:30:15 IST,"Residents of T.N. Chinnaswamy Avenue in Ward 1 of the Coimbatore Corporation say they are going the worst time yet in terms of drinking water supply under the Pilloor scheme for over two months.The layout is among the many that fall under the North and East zones of the Corporation that are struggling for water.Official sources say that with the bulk of the city's new regularised layouts located in these zones, the residential colonies have been pushed into a phase of scarcity from that of abundance.The areas coming under the Pilloor scheme were envied by those in the Siruvani scheme areas because the former enjoyed a sustained allocation of 65 million litres a day throughout the year. But, the monsoon determined the quantity of supply in the Siruvani areas.But, the residents in Wards 1 and 2 say that water adequacy was a thing of the past. Now, it is a tough struggle.“Every day, at least 10 women walk to the Corporation's overhead tank near our colony in a desperate search for water,” says secretary of T.N. Chinnaswamy Avenue Welfare Association K. Ramachandran.Ward 1 councillor K. Chandrasekar says: “It 13 days (till May 4) since we got water supply. When we take this up with the Corporation water supply staff or officials, they cite power shutdown as the reason. Three hours of power cut has a direct effect on the areas where water has to be pumped to from the water tank.”Ward 2 councillor D. Jothimani too has a similar complaint. “We get water only once in 10 days,” she says. “And, there is no solution to this problem though we have taken it up with the water supply wing of the civic body.”Mr. Chandrasekar wonders how Avarampalayam gets water once in five days and not Wards 1 and 2 that were not very far away.Mr. Ramachandran says the residents are even more upset with the water supply staff for not informing of the probable supply time.“The supply is made at 11 p.m. If we know of this in advance, we can stay awake. Otherwise, we will never know of the supply.”Even in the case of disruption in Pilloor supply because of problems in the supply line such as leaks of bursts, the residents say that they should know when the supply will be restored in their respective layouts after the supply in the main line is restored.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/Water-supply-erratic-say-residents/article16298584.ece

Stating that this was the first public interaction on the issue and a lot of inputs were received, she said, “I am in favour of another round.''Ms. Dikshit said all the suggestions would be considered in setting up a mechanism in which the Delhi Government would have a role in various aspects of policing. “It is all about how better we can serve Delhi, which is widely perceived as not a safe city,'' she said.The Chief Minister said the reasons for crime in Delhi are many including its porous borders. But since it is a special city being the Capital of the country and has a large diplomatic corps, there is a strong need to modernise the force. Also, she said, a department is needed within the Delhi Police for social service-oriented work and for identifying and rectifying problems that affect the society.The conference was attended by a number of Delhi Ministers, BJP MLA Sahab Singh Chauhan, Chief Secretary Rakesh Mehta, Union Home Secretary G.K. Pillai, Principal Secretary (Home) G.S. Patnaik, Commissioner of Delhi Police Y.S. Dadwal, former Supreme Court Judge Arijit Pasayat, and lawyers, retired bureaucrats, heads of various departments and representatives of residents' welfare associations.The need for the discussion arose as the Delhi Government has prepared a legislative proposal for the Delhi Police (Amendment) Bill, 2010, to implement the direction of Supreme Court in the matter of Prakash Singh and others versus Government of India and others.The proposal was uploaded on the website of the Delhi Government at www.delhi.gov.in inviting public views and suggestions to arrive at a broad consensus. At the conference, there was general consensus on transfer of traffic matters and other non-core functions to the Delhi Government. Besides, the Delhi Police was called upon to implement social legislation.It was also stated that other issues such as the term of Police Commissioner and other officers, functioning of the Screening Committee and Scrutiny Committee, constitution and supervision of Police Appellate Authority in each district and Thana Committees at the police station level be brought under the Delhi Government.The Second Administrative Reforms Commission had expressly recommended that the Union Government may retain control over the broader aspects of security and law and order whereas traffic and enforcement of special laws could be handed over to the Delhi Government.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Need-to-modernise-Delhi-Police-Sheila/article16298655.ece

A multipurpose galvanised iron wire now stands tall as a farmer with a plough on his shoulders. At another corner of the wall, a piece of thermocol has been turned into an exquisite clay model of Radha-Krishna, imitating art on wood complete with fine engravings.The clay used to mould these three-dimensional figures is unique. Unlike normal clay models, which develop cracks, do not have solidity and need to be ‘fired' in a kiln, this clay does not require any special treatment.To top it off, it is eco-friendly and no chemicals have been used in its preparation.The studio of artist K. Muralidhar at Sindhi Colony has loads of such astonishing clay models, moulded by using things which are usually discarded to a bust-bin.The empty box of a talcum powder now has a clay face on it and can be used as a paperweight. A used towel has been expertly moulded, by using the clay, into wavy curls of a woman.“Such artwork is usually done with plaster of Paris, cement or adhesives like an M.seal”. Normal clay does not bind and cracks develop immediately. I have prepared this eco-friendly clay without any chemicals. The colours being used in the artwork are also natural,” says Muralidhar.To prove the environment friendly nature of his clay, Muralidhar grows decorative plants at his art studio, by using the clay, in small pots. The artist has done lot of research on how to prevent clay models from developing cracks, make them light weight and without using furnace or a kiln to heat.“I have used grounded cotton powder to prevent cracks and wood powder to make clay light in weight,” he reveals. The clay is soluble and artworks can be recycled by dipping in water. “If you are not happy by the finished artwork, just dip it in water and start again,” he says.

1074,"3,000 habitations face water scarcity",B. Chandrashekhar,2010-05-06,00:24:08 IST,"The drinking water situation in rural areas across the State is alarming due to depletion of water availability and drying up of sources.Authorities of the Rural Water Supply Department admit that about 38 lakh people in nearly 3,000 habitations, mostly in Telangana region, are facing drinking water scarcity.Some district Collectors, at whose disposal the State government has kept sufficient funds to tie over the situation, have been found wanting in taking the call to meet the demand in several districts. As a result, people in most of the affected habitations are being forced to manage with a meagre supply of 15 litres per capita per day (LPCD) against the WHO-standard requirement of 40 LPCD.“The WHO norm means water requirement of a person for all his needs in a day. But, we (RWS Department) are supplying water only for drinking and cooking needs”, officials of the department argued. Summer has put severe stress on water sources resulting in 154 protected water supply schemes becoming defunct and 15,009 borewells getting seasonal.When contacted, Deputy Chief Engineer of RWS B. Surender Reddy told The Hindu on Tuesday that drinking water was being transported to 2,939 habitations as on May 4 due to shortfall in yield (1,091), drying up and depletion in the water quality (1,831) and power supply problem (17). Need of 1,831 habitations was being met by hiring private sources like agricultural borewells.Shortfall in water yield in sources was high in Chittoor (374 habitations), Karimnagar (115), Srikakulam (110), Adilabad (81), Krishna (65), Kadapa (53), Warangal (46), Medak (41), Nizamabad (39) and Khammam (31), whereas drying up of sources and depletion in quality was more in Warangal (902), Chittoor (499), Nalgonda (310), Karimnagar (282), Medak (151), Adilabad (132), Nizamabad (119), Kadapa (117), Srikakulam (113) and Khammam (71), he explained.Shortage of staff has also become a bottleneck in meeting the demand in some districts like Nizamabad, where only 15 per cent of the sanctioned strength was available. Of the a sum of Rs. 57.53 crore released to Collectors for taking up contingency measures in scarcity habitations only Rs.16,67 crore has been utilised so far. Besides, Rs. 25 lakh each legislators' ACDP fund has also been allocated for the purpose.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3000-habitations-face-water-scarcity/article16298578.ece
1075,Bringing back a cultural metaphor,J. S. Ifthekhar,2010-05-06,00:22:50 IST,"Years roll back and time seems to stand still. Hyderabad's founder, Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, reclines on his throne with the royal guards in attendance. The poets are seated in a semi-circle on spotless white ‘chandnees'. The air is rife with expectation as the ‘shama' is placed before a poet.Yes, one is transported back in time as a typical mushaira of the Quli Qutb Shah days comes alive. Mushairas figure at the top on the cultural calendar of Hyderabad, but this one is different. It is a throwback to the olden times when aesthetic values had not yielded place to crass commercialisation.An earnest attempt was made the other day by artistes belonging to “Aiwan-e-Fankar” to bring back the glory of mushairas of yore. They tried to trace the journey of the ‘ghazal', capturing the typical ambience, the rich blend of thought and feelings. Not just this. Artistes donned period costumes complete with flowing beards and long tresses to play the roles of great poets like Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Daag, Jigar, Hasrat Mohani down to the recent greats like Shaz Tamkanat and Maqdoom Mohiuddin.For most part, the history of Urdu poetry is the story of the Urdu ghazal. But the current generation brought up on MTV has neither the taste nor interest to appreciate the nuances of shayari. “We want to present the greatest of Urdu poets in their original style. And also to show how mushairas were actually held earlier,” says Javeed Kamal, the man behind ‘Tamseeli mushaira'.Sure, this is a fairly good attempt to revive interest in the institution of mushaira. Interestingly, it seeks to treat the audience with the best of Urdu ghazals from the best writers of the genre. Mr. Kamal has shot the two-hour concert and it will be soon available in CD format. Urdu lovers can now watch the legendary poets recite from the comfort of their homes.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Bringing-back-a-cultural-metaphor/article16298576.ece

Raheem, 22, got buried alive under the heaps of garbage three days ago. Shanmuga believed that some miracle would bring back his son alive. His hopes were shattered as a poclain operator stumbled upon a severed body.Families of the three victims ran there to see who it was. Shanmuga collapsed on seeing that the severed body was that of his son, recognising it by the colour of the trousers and innerwear that he last wore.“Probably, the huge steel hook of the poclain hit the body severing it,” the police said. Vaasu was the only son of Shanmuga. His mother died few years ago. Theirs was one of the nearly 100 rag-picking families living near the yard, picking plastic from garbage and selling it for recycling.Shanmuga cried inconsolably on seeing his son's body refusing to leave the place till his son's head was found. The police sent him away convincing him that searches in the night would not be helpful. Family members of Raheem and Khaja too underwent equally tense moments as the bodies of their beloved ones could not be traced.Sania, wife of Raheem, went to Moosarambagh on Monday to see her ailing mother when she learnt that her husband got trapped in the garbage. They got married a year ago. The shell-shocked woman sat at the yard as searches continued for the last two days.Officials restricted rag-pickers from entering the dumping yard when a rag-picking woman, Nagamma, 42, died after heaps of garbage fell on her 10 days ago. “This meant no work and no food for us. Apparently, my son Khaja was worried about the family's fate and ventured into the yard in the night looking for plastic along with the other two,” Khaja's mother Sabera Begum said.

Officials want to announce the results taking into consideration the marks obtained in the re-verification of scripts and recounting of marks obtained in the advanced supplementary examinations.Officials said since verification of certificates has nothing to do with ranks obtained they want to advance the process. Last year, verification was done in 59 helpline centres across the State, and this year the number may be increased as new centres have been added in two more districts.If a final decision is taken the process is likely to start in June second week after the marks of EAMCET are announced.

  | Photo Credit: G_Karthikeyan With effective intervention of government hospitals and good support and coordination from the NGOs and Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres, the rate of spreading of HIV among people had come down to 0.025 per cent from 1.36 per cent, said T. Jayabal, Joint Director of Health Services.He was addressing an AIDS awareness seminar meant for HIV affected persons, nurses and volunteers held here on Wednesday.Approximately four million people have been living with HIV in the world including in African countries, top in the world in having highest number of HIV patients. India's position was number two in this list but it was number one in controlling the disease.Dindigul district alone had over 8,000 persons living with HIV. Only 3,411 patients had registered with Anti-Retroviral Therapy Centre of which 1,678 patients got regular treatment. Besides, 89 children too were also treated at the ART centre, Dr. Jayabal pointed out. The Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society had offered Rs.1.38 lakh to meet their educational needs, he added.He appealed to all persons living with HIV to register their names with the ART centre and avail its care and support services. The non-governmental organisations, volunteers and village health nurses should strive hard to include those who had not registered their names with the ART centre.Early detection of HIV, prompt diagnosis and treatment would certainly ensure reduction of morbidity and mortality of the infected and quality of life of the affected could also be improved. Effective management of the disease would also help delay the progression of the disease. The ART centre in Dindigul GH had all facilities and equipments required to test the patients. Patients need not go to Madurai for diagnosis and tests. The GH had even a legal cell for AIDS patients to protect their rights, he added.In his special address, Tamil Nadu Health System Project Coordinator A. Asai Thambi said that persons aged below 50 years alone were mostly affected by AIDS. Weakening the youth population will have a direct impact on the economic development and growth of the nation, he added.Speakers stated that HIV cases were on the rise in Oddanchatram, Nilakottai and Batlagundu.

Nevertheless, there was a slump in the progress of the project for a year.In June 2008, a Lok Adalat comprising the Law Minister Durai Murugan, the then Chief Justice of the High Court A.K. Ganguly and the then Chairman of the Law Commission AR. Lakshmanan directed the Government to complete the project, preferably, by the end of year.A few months thereafter, it was announced that the construction would be taken up by the Public Works Department (PWD) instead of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). A foundation stone laying ceremony was held at Court Hall No.1 of the High Court Bench on November 1, 2008.The PWD, in February 2009, submitted a revised estimate to the Government to hike the project cost from Rs.19.38 crore to Rs.25.2 crore in view of escalation in prices of construction materials and considering the changes made by the High Court to the original building plan.The court had insisted on leaving vehicle parking space in the ground floor. Therefore, it was decided to construct four-storey buildings instead of three-storeys as it was planned originally. The sanction for the revised estimate got delayed due to the Parliamentary elections.After three months, a Government Order was issued in June 2009 granting sanction for Rs.25.2 crore.Subsequently, the PWD kickstarted the process of calling for tenders for various works and finalised the contractors even as the High Court staff waited with bated breath.At last, the court employees were able to see some light at the end of the tunnel on Monday when the officials brought a set of bricks and a bag of sand to the construction site, for the first time, to conduct a ‘bhoomi puja' .Having waited for nearly six years, the staff now only hope and pray that the buildings would come up within 15 to 18 months without any further delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/High-Court-staff-see-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/article16298653.ece

Prabhakaran, to enter Tamil Nadu to get medical treatment.He was addressing a public meeting here to highlight the proposed agitation blocking all roads leading to Kerala on May 28.Reacting to Mr. Karunanidhi's contention that he was not aware of Ms. Parvathiammal landing at Chennai airport, Mr. Vaiko questioned how a huge posse of police personnel was deployed at the airport before the flight could land. “Did the police come there without the Chief Minister's knowledge? Why did the police block me and P. Nedumaran (convenor of Mullaperiyar Dam Rights Retrieval Committee) from entering the airport though we had visitors' pass with us,” he said.He also condemned Mr. Karunanidhi for his argument that Ms. Parvathiammal was denied entry into Tamil Nadu as she was blacklisted by the Centre based on a recommendation made by the former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa. “If Ms. Parvathiammal was blacklisted, the Indian embassy in Malaysia could not have issued her a visa enabling her to visit India,” Mr. Vaiko said.Mr. Karunadhi always had the liberty to reverse the previous Government's decision on allowing Ms. Parvathiammal, considering her condition, he said. He sought an apology from the Centre and the State for their “inhuman” act against an ailing aged woman.On the dam issue, Mr. Vaiko said he had little hope that the Supreme Court could render justice to Tamil Nadu. He said that people of Tamil Nadu could not nurture any faith on the apex court that had reversed its own three-member bench verdict on the dam row by constituting a five-member committee to study the stability of the structure. He wondered what the panel was going to do after two Central committees had certified the stability of the dam and after which the Supreme Court allowed the level to be raised to 142 feet.He wanted the people of Tamil Nadu to participate in large numbers in the May 28 road roko in the interest of the future generations of the five districts benefited by Periyar dam. “If we failed to check Kerala Government in its plan to decommission the dam, these districts would become a desert,” he said.Mr. Nedumaran said that the Chief Minister could have put pressure on the Centre to implement the Supreme Court verdict on the dam issue citing the unrest caused in the State by the Opposition parties.Communist Party of India's State deputy secretary, C. Mahendran, warned that nationalism should ensure that every citizen was equally treated. The party always fought for Tamil Nadu's right on land and water issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Vaiko-voices-concern-over-dam-issue/article16298652.ece
1083,Pudhurai Vannars seek community certificates,Staff Reporter,2010-05-06,02:16:12 IST,"For a few members belonging to the Pudhirai Vannar caste, obtaining community certificates has become more than an uphill task. The members have been running from pillar to post for months together representing their case in the grievance meetings but all in vain.S.Pechiammal and M.Alagarsamy of Pudhupatti, A .Muruganandam, Ettimangalam near Melur, K.Murugan, Keeraithurai and V.Murugan, Vavval Thottam have submitted petitions to the Adi Dravidar Tribal Welfare Minister, District Collector and Revenue Divisional Officer.V.Murugan, member, Tamil Nadu Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board, says “for the above said members of Pudhirai Vannar caste it is stated so in their school certificates but community certificates are not issued to them.” When enquired in the office of Adi Dravidar Welfare Department, all that Murugan and his fellow caste members were told was that it was stopped 15 years ago.The community members alleged that certificates were given randomly; in most cases, anyone among the family holds a certificate but when asked for others in the family the authorities are reluctant to issue them.According to government records, the Pudhirai Vannars are one among the 76 Scheduled Castes. The name, Pudhirai Vannar, is listed 60th in the Tamil Nadu list of Scheduled Castes, as laid out by the Scheduled Castes (Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into effect from July 27, 1977.However, the state authorities do not easily issue community certificates in the name of Puthirai Vannars. Mr.Murugan has in fact raised this issue during the first meeting held at Chennai on January 28, after the establishment of a separate “Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board” G.O. No.114.The members said that it was great that the State had established a board and provided Rs.50 lakh for the year 2009–2010 to extend relief to the needy registered members of the board.All this is welcome but we need community certificates to get a sense of belongingness to our own caste identity, they alleged. Pudhirai Vannars remain as a caste that can be referred to as victims of ‘multiple marginalisation' who provide services to Dalits.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Pudhurai-Vannars-seek-community-certificates/article16298650.ece

  | Photo Credit: Bijoy Ghosh The Murugappa Group has set itself a turnover of target of over $7 billion to be hit by 2013-14. At present, the group has a turnover of $3.03 billion.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, A. Vellayan, Executive Chairman of the group, said each business unit of the group had worked out a strategy to grow at 24 per cent annually. With the country's GDP (gross domestic product) projected to grow at 8 per cent, Mr. Vellayan felt that the sales target was achievable. He said all the business units were looking to grow three times the GDP.The group's turnover for 2009-10 dropped by 14 per cent from Rs. 15,907 crore to Rs. 13,617 crore, mainly due to a sharp drop in the prices of key inputs for Coromandel International Ltd., the Executive Chairman said. Coromandel reported a 32 per cent decline in its turnover at Rs. 6,431 crore, the biggest sales drop among the group companies.Notwithstanding the setback on the turnover front, the Murugappa Group reported a 22 per cent jump in EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation) at Rs. 1,879 crore against Rs. 1,535 crore. The profit before tax (excluding extraordinary income) of the group grew by 29 per cent to Rs. 1,354 crore from Rs. 1,054 crore.Mr. Vellayan said that the group was able to ride the wave of economic rebound powered by enterprise-wide efficiency. EID Parry, he said, had increased its daily cane crushing capacity to 32,500 tonnes (along with 150 MW co-generation power and 230 kl alcohol) by acquiring Sadashiva Sugars in Karnataka and GMR Industries, which have plants in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The sugar refinery at Kakinada was expected to start operations this month, he added.Besides sugar, Mr. Vellayan indicated that fertilizers and engineering could be key growth areas for the group in the coming years. “With favourable growth outlook for auto and commercial vehicles sector, we see a growth potential of 20 per cent,” said N. Srinivasan, Director (Finance), Murugappa Group.Mr. Vellayan admitted that the group's foray into China was not a good experience. While the group closed its tube operations, it pulled out of the abrasive joint venture in China.On the challenges being faced on the HR front in the wake of entry of MNCs and big industrial houses from across the country into Tamil Nadu, he said “We have seven home grown CEOs heading the group companies. The management development centre conducts leadership and business development programmes.”",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/Murugappa-Group-profit-up-29-per-cent-at-Rs.-1350-crore/article16298863.ece

Customer research has already shown that BMW is the strongest premium car brand and we hope to keep this customer confidence intact and grow even faster,” Dr. Schaaf added.Dr. Schaaf, who has completed his doctoral thesis and studied business administration at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, has come to head BMW's India operations after a successful stint as the Vice-President of BMW Group Korea with responsibility of sales and marketing. Before joining BMW Group Korea, he was the head of market development for the region Asia, Pacific, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe.On the other hand, Mr. Kronschnabl will be leading the German carmaker's Russia operations, where the company enjoys the leadership position. Since BMW India's inception in 2006, Mr. Kronschnabl not only built the BMW brand, setting up sales and service networks, but also took the Munich-headquartered company to the numero uno position. “I wish and hope that BMW India grows even faster… BMW is not just a brand, it's a philosophy,” he said in his farewell message.In 2009, BMW overtook Mercedes as the top luxury carmaker in the Indian market with sales of 3,619 units.

Consumer prices in India, particularly of food, have “remained stubbornly high”, it said while pointing to the Consumer Price Index (for industrial workers) which rose to nearly 9 per cent in 2008 and further to 12 per cent in 2009. “A faster increase in food prices has become a cause of concern,” it said.Turning to the South Asian economies, ESCAP expressed concern over the high deficits in some countries owing to the expansionary policies to counter the impact of the global financial crisis. “It is important that governments in the sub-region prepare a clear road map for fiscal consolidation to be implemented at the earliest to contain growing public debt…Yet another challenge is to manage portfolio capital inflows, mainly by FIIs that are leading to build-up of bubbles in capital markets and putting upward pressure on the exchange rates,” the report said.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ESCAP-projects-8.3-GDPgrowth-for-India-this-fiscal/article16298857.ece

1102,Mauritius elections hold promise for India,Pranay Gupte,2010-05-06,23:23:21 IST,"Mauritius Prime Minister Navin Ramgoomam cast his vote at a polling booth in Vacoas town, Mauritius. File Photo: AP
  Now that the three-party alliance of Navin Ramgoolam has won 41 of the 60 seats in the Mauritius national Parliament — more than double the number of Paul Berenger's leftist Mouvement Militant Mauricien — there is general agreement that the 63-year-old former physician and lawyer has obtained a powerful mandate to implement economic and social reforms in his second consecutive term as this island-nation's Prime Minister.Some of those reforms eluded him during his first term; indeed, a few unpopular measures that Mr. Ramgoolam introduced — such as a national residential property tax, and another tax on interest from savings — spurred flight of capital in certain circles. The expectation is that such measures will be reviewed and possibly eliminated.The Prime Minister has also pledged a more aggressive “democratisation” of the economy — ensuring, among other things, that ownership of the vast sugarcane plantations that are currently controlled by the minority whites of French descent is also made accessible to other communities in this country of 1.3 million people dominated by Hindus. Creoles, Christians and Muslims also compromise larger sections of the demographic cohort than the Francos. A special “democratisation unit” has been formed in the Prime Minister's office, and its workload is certain to be amplified.Mr. Ramgoolam's election victory has also brought relief to several business supporters who had been targeted by Mr. Berenger and his financial backers. They had been apprehensive that the Berenger group would subvert, if not entirely destroy, their commerce.
Opposition claim
The 65-year-old Mr. Berenger, silver-haired and wearing an open-necked blue shirt, appeared at a gathering of followers early on Thursday evening and promised to continue “fighting the good fight”, and promised to work toward national unity. He was gracious about the Prime Minister's victory — a sentiment not necessarily appreciated by many in his audience — but asserted that the elections were neither free nor fair. Mr. Berenger chided the national television network for blatantly favouring the Prime Minister's alliance in order to ensure its victory.The Ramgoolam alliance's victory, however, will most definitely be welcomed by India, not the least because Mauritius contributes $12 billion in foreign direct investment to India, by far the biggest annual FDI from any country. Mr. Berenger — a former Prime Minister himself — while publicly proclaiming his fidelity to an “umbilical relationship” with India, has been known to privately express a desire for strengthened commercial and political relations with France and other Western powers.India's Chief Election Commissioner Navin Chawla has been here for the last several days at the invitation of the government. He was not an official observer, of course, but other Indian representatives in Mauritius must feel emboldened now to suggest stronger technical, educational and computer-science links between both countries. They are surely mindful of the disappointment of influential Mauritian business leaders that such ties were not deepened by India in the last few years.But they are also mindful that Mr. Ramgoolam enjoys a warm personal rapport with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. On Thursday, therefore, there were renewed expectations that Mr. Ramgoolam's new term could usher in an era characterised by enhanced bilateral economic and political relations.Those expectations took into account a public position by Mr. Ramgoolam that the Indian Ocean coral atoll of Diego Garcia — part of the Chagos Archipelago — would be turned over to Mauritius by the United States, which has maintained a large military base there since a 1971 secret agreement with the British Labour government of then Prime Minister Harold Wilson. That agreement called for Diego Garcia to be leased to the U.S.; the military base has been used by Washington for missile launches and naval operations against suspected terrorist havens in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and also parts of Africa.Some Indian critics have long felt that the American presence on Diego Garcia represented a form of political hegemony in the Indian Ocean, territory that ordinarily should be viewed as within India's sphere of influence.Mr. Ramgoolam has also suggested that Mauritius co-administer Tromelin Island, currently a French territory.
Concern for India
But one major issue of concern to India that may crop up during his new administration is that of China's growing economic presence in Mauritius, and its ambition to widen political influence throughout Africa. For example, China is building a new palm-frond-shaped airport here; it is also creating an industrial city from where goods will be re-exported to Africa and Europe.It is not that Mr. Ramgoolam is particularly wooing China, although its contribution to the local economy has been welcomed. It is India that has lagged in taking timely advantage of the economic opportunities available in a country of high literacy and aspirations to become a high-tech centre for the region.Such geopolitical considerations, of course, were not quite the stuff of the main conversations on Thursday in Mauritius as the election results poured in, and the winners celebrated at rallies while losers lamented without seeming to be grieving. Politics, after all, is not only about democracy, it is also about deportment.There was wide delight that Mr. Ramgoolam's second term would represent stability and continuity — his trusted lieutenant, Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun won from his constituency in the capital of Port Louis, in what had been a race made difficult and ugly by his opponent.It was also noted that, in addition to Paul Berenger's general political loss, the opposition front bench had been considerably weakened by the defeat of three of his closest aides. The craggy old leftist has now only his own shoulders to lean on, at least in Parliament. But who said politics was fair?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Mauritius-elections-hold-promise-for-India/article16298868.ece

  Auctioneers Christie's is facing a bitter compensation claim after a drawing it sold for £11,400 as a 19th-century German picture is claimed, actually, to be a 15th-century Leonardo da Vinci worth £100 million.The picture's original owner, Jeanne Marchig, who runs a U.K. foundation for animal welfare, is accusing the auction-house of negligence, alleging that it misattributed the drawing. She claims that, in failing to “exercise due care”, it sold the artwork for a “fraction” of its true value, according to a complaint filed in the Manhattan federal court.The drawing, a profile of a girl, is now on exhibition in Gothenberg, Sweden, as a Da Vinci. Ms Marchig is seeking unspecified damages, but court papers seen by the Guardian show her lawyer wants a substantial figure. They say the drawing is insured for more than $100 million and that its value exceeds $150 million.Ms Marchig was “devastated” when she discovered last July — in a call from Christie's — that the Da Vinci scholar Martin Kemp had hailed the portrait as La Bella Principessa, a depiction of Bianca Sforza, daughter of the Duke of Milan. The court papers assert that there is ample evidence that it is a Da Vinci. They mention a faint fingerprint, which matches that on a painting by Da Vinci, and carbon tests indicating dates from 1440 to 1650, not the 19th century. Christie's is accused of failure to use scientific methods and technology.But other experts are unconvinced of the attribution. Jacques Franck, the Da Vinci consultant at UCLA, told the Guardian on Wednesday: “It's not Leonardo's hand. The drawing presents anatomical mistakes, notably the link between the neck and the bust.” A Christie's spokesman said: “Christie's strongly disagrees with these claims and believes they are without merit.” — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Legal-battle-over-ldquoda-Vincirdquo/article16298867.ece
1104,Kabul unveils plan to disarm militants,Jon Boone,2010-05-06,23:22:49 IST,"Afganistan President Hamid Karzai
  Top Taliban leaders could be offered exile outside Afghanistan if they agree to stop fighting the government of Hamid Karzai, a long-expected peace plan by the Afghan government will propose later this month.The far-reaching proposals, seen by the Guardian, also call for “deradicalisation” classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs created for foot soldiers who renounce violence.The long-delayed Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme has emerged just as Mr. Karzai prepares to go to Washington for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama, where the issue is likely to be top of the agenda.The plan will then be presented later in the month to a gathering of representatives from across Afghanistan called the National Consultative Peace Jirga. Once agreed upon, the government will be able to start spending around $160 million pledged by the international community to lure fighters away from the conflict. The document refers to such fighters as “angry brothers”, reflecting the belief that a substantial portion of insurgents are not motivated by strong ideological beliefs.Little is said in the report about the Taliban leaders managing the war against Mr. Karzai's government. However, it does say insurgent leaders could face “potential exile in a third country”.Saudi Arabia has been used in the past for such purposes, and there has been widespread speculation that exile could be offered to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hizb-e-Islami armed group, which in March sent a peace delegation to Kabul for talks with Mr. Karzai.Western powers are likely to be pleased by the level of detail about the new High Level Peace Council, which will take over from a notoriously chaotic predecessor body accused of reintegrating fighters who subsequently took up arms again.However, diplomats are worried that the government lacks the capacity to implement a programme that calls for complex activities in around 4,000 villages most affected by the insurgency. One diplomat said: “For the international community money is not a problem, they will pay whatever it takes. One gets a sense that there are people on the military side who will do most of the work and then give it some sort of an Afghan face.” The High Council and its executive body will be in charge of processing fighters who want to live peacefully. They will initially be put in “demobilisation centres” for a “cooling off” period of 90 days where their needs can be assessed and their personal security assured.If they agree to lay down their arms and cut ties with al Qaeda they will be entitled to an amnesty against prosecution for any crimes they may have committed. They will also be issued with a biometric “reintegration card”. They will then be offered a “menu” of options designed to keep them peacefully occupied, including vocational training in such trades as carpet-weaving and tailoring.There will also be the option to go through “deradicalisation” training, of the sort pioneered by Saudi Arabia. However, the report acknowledges the complexity of such programmes, the lack of “adequate experience” in Afghanistan and the likely need to send “highly radicalised” people to other countries for treatment.Major new institutions will also be set up to manage enormous job-creation schemes. An Engineering and Construction Corps will focus on labour-intensive work, such as the construction of Afghanistan's national highway system and other large-scale infrastructure projects. It also envisages teams of ex-Taliban fighters being rapidly deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and landslides. By far the most controversial option is the option for former insurgents to join the Afghan Army or police force. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Kabul-unveils-plan-to-disarm-militants/article16298866.ece
1105,Lula and the Brazilian moment,Jorge Heine,2010-05-06,23:04:43 IST,"Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil. File Photo: AP
  T
ime magazine has just named President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the world's most influential leader. Barack Obama is ranked fourth. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is 19th (there are only four heads of state or government in the list). This is an exercise somewhat different from the traditional “Person of the Year” selection Time engages in each December, but highly revealing nonetheless. It is defined as “not about the influence of power, but about the power of influence.” Time has never selected a Latin American leader as person of the year. In India, Mahatma Gandhi made it in 1930.Brazil, once known as “the country of the future” that would always remain as such, has come a long way. That this should happen at the close of the eight-year presidency of the leader of the Brazilian Workers party (the PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores), whose very election prospects in 2002 led to a run on the real, the Brazilian currency, and BOVESPA, the Sao Paulo stock market, is striking.What is the secret of Lula and Brazil's success? How come a country best known until 20 years ago for its runaway inflation and rollercoaster economy has made it its present condition an investors' darling, that applies highly effective social policies, and that has positioned itself as a veto player in international affairs, one without whose acquiescence no major global initiative is viable?With a land mass of some 8.5 million square kilometres, the world's fifth largest, comparable to the continental United States, Brazil is more a continent than country. With a population of 190 million, and growing fast, it is not quite in the same league as China and India (which is why some people said there were “only two BRICs in the wall”), but is still the fifth most populated country. More than one out of three Latin Americans is Brazilian. With a GDP approaching $2 trillion, it is the eighth largest economy.Yet, Brazil's size has been immense ever since its independence in the 19th century, whereas its rise to the frontlines of international affairs has taken place only in the past 20 years. Why?The answer is simple: presidential leadership. Most would be hard-pressed to name a Brazilian president from the 1960s to the 1990s. For 20 years the country was run by obscure generals, and in 1985, with the return of democracy, by lacklustre civilians, who did little to combat the runaway inflation and the deep imbalances in one of the most unequal societies in the world.Lula has done a remarkable job, but he stands on the shoulders of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994-2002). It was as the improbable Minister for Finance of President Itamar Franco in 1993 that Cardoso, a sociologist, made his mark. He was the author of the Plan Real that brought inflation under control, and launched him all the way to Planalto, the presidential palace in Brasilia. Much like 1991 was a turnaround year in India, when under Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the country started to liberalise and open up its economy, 1993 was such a year in Brazil, and it has never looked back.Cardoso realised that Brazil needed not just to stabilise its currency but also to open up and deregulate its economy, stifled by decades of rampant protectionism. He privatised state enterprises, opened the doors for FDI and pushed business into export markets. Whereas in 1990 foreign trade reached 11 per cent of the GDP, it is now at 24 per cent. Whereas until 1990 Brazil attracted less than $1 billion a year in FDI, today it is, after China, the country in the developing world that attracts the most, reaching as much as $40 billion a year in recent times.By stabilising the polity and the economy (Brazil had four presidents from 1985 to 1994), Cardoso in his eight years did much to clear the underbrush for Lula. And despite all the criticism Lula had voiced from the opposition against Cardoso's alleged “neoliberal” policies, once he took office in January 2003, he realised that only orthodox economic policies would keep the ghost of inflation away. Lula appointed a conservative banker, Henrique Meirelles, head of the Central Bank, and briefed him to keep his eye on the inflation ball. As The Economist has pointed out, for a country whose average yearly inflation in the early 1990s reached 700 per cent, to have in 2006 a growth rate that was, for the first time, higher than the inflation rate was quite a feat.Lula, a former metal worker who lost one of his fingers on the factory floor, also came up with an imaginative social policy, the Bolsa de Familia. It transfers cash income to some 11 million families, who have to meet certain conditions (including school attendance of children, and monthly visits to government agencies), and has diminished Brazil's income inequality.As a man who cut his political teeth in the trade union movement, Lula knows all about “win-win” negotiations. He has also a remarkable ability to get along with everybody — from George W. Bush to Hugo Chávez. The PT is only one among many in the fragmented Brazilian party system (it controls only the governorships in three States out of Brazil's 27), and he leads a coalition government that includes right-wing parties, in Brazil's hard to manage “presidential coalitionism.” He has struck a delicate balance in which the private sector is the driving force of the economy, but the state plays a significant role through entities such as the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento (BNDES), which has a larger lending budget than the World Bank, and Petrobras, the state-owned oil company.In a country known for its populist, demagogic traditions, Lula embodies the modern leader who believes in institutions. In a region where many presidents want to perpetuate themselves in office, he rejected the possibility of changing the Constitution to allow him a third term. His own rags-to-riches trajectory and austere personal habits have meant that the corruption scandals that affected some of his staff never seriously dented his popularity, leading to the moniker of “teflon president”. His approval ratings have reached 80 per cent. He has been mentioned for a variety of top international jobs once he leaves office on 1 January 2011— from President of the World Bank to Secretary-General of the United Nations.Given that in foreign affairs also Lula has made a big impact, this is not surprising. With Celso Amorim as his Foreign Minister, he has capitalised on Brazil's “diplomatic GDP.”With an outstanding Foreign Ministry — known as “Itamaraty” for the 19th century palace in Rio de Janeiro that used to house it before the capital moved to Brazilia — Brazil has exercised its diplomacy with finesse and effectiveness. On the multilateral front, its ability to build coalitions, to give direction to the international agenda, and to take on key global governance issues has stood out. It has displayed it in the WTO and the U.N., as well as in the creation of (or inclusion in) myriad acronyms such as BRICs, BRICSAM, IBSA, the G20+, the G4, the O5, and, most notably, in the G20 at the leaders level (“the steering committee of the world economy”) launched in Washington in November 2008, and whose next meeting is being held in Toronto in late June. It has also put its money where its mouth is: at a time when many Foreign Ministries have cut budgets and closed embassies, Brazil, grasping that diplomacy has become more, and not less, significant in the age of globalisation, has done the opposite. From 2003 to 2008 it opened 32 embassies abroad, and now has 134.In Latin America also Brazil has played a key role. It has been the driving force behind new entities such as UNASUR, which has brought together all nations in South America, and the associated South American Defence Council, designed to provide an alternative to the by-now obsolete Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. It has taken the lead in stabilising Haiti through MINUSTAH, the first U.N. peacekeeping mission formed by a majority of Latin American troops and headed by a Brazilian general. It is willing to work with Washington, but not if that entails sacrificing principles such as democratic rule, as shown in last year's Honduran crisis.Instead of caving in to the so-called imperatives of globalisation, as so many other developing nations have done, Lula has led Brazil to assert its autonomy and independence, setting its own conditions for dealing with an international order in flux. His is the best example of the power of agency and initiative in foreign policy and diplomacy.

The achievement of Anbakam Metals was illustrated in Home News Tribune and Sentinel.The award stresses the importance of exports in the national economy and illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities, the Sentinel reported. “Anbakam's niche markets have been focussed on the Indian subcontinent region and the Far East. The firm has helped to create a demand for containerized shipments of metal scrap while supplying jobs amid a gloomy job market.It has used the Department of Commerce's Gold Key Program to create business opportunities and sales in the Vietnam market,” the report said.While working as a business software developer for JP Morgan Chase Mr. Sivakumar started the company by customising containers for easy loading of scrap metal for export from trucks to ships at the Northeast region of United States.The company moved 10,000 tonnes of scrap metal to overseas market last year using the small volumes approach that had been vogue for years in California and Florida.Exports by the company accounted for one per cent of the 14 million tonnes of ferrous exports from the US in 2009, according to the report published by Home News Tribune. A press release issued by the company's Liaison Office, Tiruchi, said that the award designed by the US Government to recognise export businesses illustrates the contributions made by exporters to their local communities and companies which have successfully entered into international markets and had great success with the help of US Government agencies.Anbakam Metals is now looking to extend its services to newer, untouched markets, the release said.Mr. Sivakumar, who started his career as a 22-year-old with Pershing Corp, which specialised in business intelligence technology, and subsequently worked for BMW and JP Morgan, before venturing into the metal scrap business, said of Anbakam's future plans: “In next three to six months, we will be breaking ground for a power plant in South India and also venturing into renewable energy sector in the USA.

1112,Seven Bayern players in Germany WC squad,DPA,2010-05-06,19:06:26 IST,"Germany coach Joachim Loew chose seven Bayern Munich players including keeper Hans-Joerg Butt and uncapped defender Holger Badstuber in a provisional 27-man squad for the World Cup.SV Hamburg defender Dennis Aogo is another uncapped player in the party, which will be reduced to 23 by June 1 for the June 11-July 11 tournament in South Africa.Butt, 35, earns his place following the withdrawal of Bayer Leverkusen’s Rene Adler who is to undergo surgery on a fractured rib.He earned the last of his three caps for Germany in 2003 but was a member of Germany’s squads at the 2000 European Championships in Belgium and the Netherlands and 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.Butt and Badstuber join 20-year-old Thomas Mueller, defender Philipp Lahm, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and strikers Miroslav Klose and Mario Gomez as part of the Bayern contingent.In addition, 20-year-old midfielder Toni Kroos, who has one cap, will be returning to Bayern next season from Bayer Leverkusen where he has spent a season-and-a-half on loan.Mueller, who has one cap from a friendly in March against Argentina, and Badstuber, 21, have both in their debut Bundesliga seasons established themselves in the Bayern side, which has reached the Champions League and German cup final and is on the brink of the Bundesliga title.Loew said he and his coaching staff had chosen what they considered “the best team” rather than the best collection of individual players.“We have seen more than 100 Bundesliga games plus German Cup, Europa League and Champions League games and we have analysed this very closely over a long time. We have absolute confidence in these players,” Loew said.There was, as expected, no place for midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger who has moved to Italian side Lazio after losing his place in the VfB Stuttgart side.Eight players were part of the 2006 World Cup team that had clinched third place: Ballack, Lahm, Klose, Schweinsteiger, Per Mertesacker, Arne Friedrich (Hertha Berlin), Marcell Jansen (Hamburger) and Lukas Podolski (Cologne).Loew said the preparations for the World Cup had never been more difficult or complicated because of the many leading players who will be joining training camps later in view of their club commitments.Ballack, who is appearing with Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and the Bayern and Bremen players, who are in the German Cup final a week on Saturday, will miss a friendly against Malta a day earlier.The Bayern players won’t be able to join up with the rest of the squad until after the May 22 Champions League final against Inter Milan in Madrid.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Seven-Bayern-players-in-Germany-WC-squad/article16298812.ece

We went for it.“People will think I’m mad coming away from home like this — all the top teams only play with one up front now. I’m very pleased — it’s great for the club, a good achievement, and we have played great football this year.” Spurs were bottom of the table when Redknapp took over in October 2008 but quickly turned them around.“Of course this means a lot to me,” he said. “I’m delighted, but I know I’m good at my job. I wouldn’t have done it if I was a mug.” Tottenham were the better side throughout, and Ledley King had the ball in the net in the first half, but his goal was ruled out for a foul.Adam Johnson tested Huerelho Gomes in the Tottenham goal, and the goalkeeper stopped a deflection from his own defender, Gareth Bale, before Kolo Toure headed straight at Gomes.Jermain Defoe forced a good save from Martin Fulop, and for a long time it looked as if it would be a draw.But with eight minutes to go, Younes Kaboul sent in a cross that took a deflection, and Fulop palmed the ball straight at Crouch, who headed the ball over the line.“I’m just very happy to finish fourth. That’s where we wanted to be,” Redknapp said. “It was important someone got in from outside the big four, I could only see Man City breaking in.“I thought it was going to be really tough — I could only see us finishing in the top seven and getting a European place. That says an awful lot for us.” In the night’s other match, Stoke City won 1-0 at Fulham thanks to a late strike from Matthew Etherington, whose goal lifted Stoke into the top half of the table.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Tottenham-secures-Champions-League-spot/article16298730.ece

  Cristiano Ronaldo rescued Real Madrid again, scoring an astonishing hat-trick in a 4-1 comeback at fifth-place Mallorca.Their fifth consecutive win keeps Real just one point behind leaders Barcelona.The twin giants have smashed the all-time Spanish points record: Barca have 93 points, Real have 92.“It was a great night for us,” said Ronaldo, “the merit corresponds to the entire team, not just to me. We just have to carry on winning and hope that Barca drop points in Sevilla.”Barca are at fourth-place Sevilla on Saturday before finishing on May 15 at home to lowly Valladolid. Real are at home Saturday to Athletic Bilbao before finish at troubled Malaga.Aritz Aduriz headed Mallorca into the lead in the 16th minute, after the Real defence had failed to clear a corner. But 10 minutes later Ronaldo made it 1-1 by getting on the end of a diagonal ball from Sergio Ramos and beating keeper Dudu Aouate with a high lob.His Real counterpart, Iker Casillas, had to pull off three sharp saves in the first half with Mallorca breaking through at will.The whites took control after the interval and pulled apart a slow Mallorca defence.In the 58th minute, Ronaldo made it 2-1 after taking another cross from Sergio Ramos on his chest and scoring with a toe-poke.The Portuguese megastar completed his hat-trick 15 minutes later with the best goal of the night. He received the ball on the left, powered past four defenders and made it 3-1 with a precise, low drive.Gonzalo Higuain made it 4-1 with an audacious lob as Mallorca lost heart and spirit.Higuain has scored 26 league goals, one more than Ronaldo, but five less than Barca’s Lionel Messi.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Ronaldo-hat-trick-gives-Real-Madrid-vital-win/article16298729.ece
1115,She's got the whole world on a string,Ranjani Govind,2010-05-06,15:26:00 IST,"Jayanthi Kumaresh
  A young veena performer from the Lalgudi family, immersed in a concert by veena S. Balachander and her aunt-guru Padmavathi Ananthagopalan, was called on stage by the maestro himself to take part. She impressed enough for him to announce that the young talent would henceforth flourish in his school. If that was a day Jayanthi Kumaresh cherishes, it is no wonder that her performances today, resonant with Balachander's style, are stamped with remarkable intellectual value.Even the recent Kumaresh-Jayanthi ‘violin-veena melodic-samvaada' at the Chamarajpet Ramseva Mandali was steeped in classicism with nary a hint of dumbing down.Although Lalgudi Rajalakshmi's gifted daughter continued her tutelage under Balachander till his death in 1990, she makes it a point to underscore the strong foundation and strict schooling she received from her aunt Padmavathi.“It wasn't just the classes, the disciplinarian that she was had me work in clockwork precision through the day. After school, her timetable had me take up yoga, typing, French classes, dance, music lessons and creative pursuits of writing and poetry.”Jayanthi, who has a Masters in English Literature, says “every pursuit will come in handy for decades”.Consider the sumptuousness of her approach, which, from the gayaki styling went on to grasp the highly individualistic creativity of Balachander's genius.“Every raga has to be discovered beyond its clichéd phrases,” she says. “Balachander was fond of raga expositions more than format-kritis, as lyrics and language, he believed, were beyond the realms of an instrument.”Jayanthi too is self-made, as her approach over the years of melodic discovery is fashioned in a way that “people understand the divine characteristics of the instrument too”. Novelty in her exercises are also to be commended, for, nothing strays beyond the classical contours. It is here that her husband Kumaresh explains her CD Thillana-Thillana that has some bracing exclusivity.Jayanthi enjoys her role in Shastriya Syndicate Presentations (a Hindustani and Carnatic collaboration) just as she sounds animated to spearhead her fusion band, Indian Spice, that has piquant raga-based presentations with vocals, drums, Latin percussion, keyboard, tabla, violin and, of course, the veena.",https://www.thehindu.com/arts/Shes-got-the-whole-world-on-a-string/article16299553.ece
1116,Life on the edge,jigar shah,2010-05-06,14:39:35 IST,"Abhishek Bachchan in 'Raavan'.
  
Abhishek Bachchan must be a happy man — not everyone gets to work for Mani Ratnam thrice! His third film with the celebrated director, Raavan is slated to hit the marquees soon. The actor narrates the unforgettable experience the film was, and why his role is the most fun he's played yet. Excerpts.


We see you jumping off a cliff, in the Raavan promo. Did it yourself?

Yeah. It was in Hogenakkal, and it was 90-foot high. Mani said: ‘I can't let my lead actor jump; the river current is strong, and there's rock below the water'. The insurance guys agreed (laughs). But, I insisted I'd do it myself, for we had a diver along, to teach me. A five-year-old boy jumped next to us, those were kids who do it for money. So, I told Mani: ‘If he can do it, so can I.'

What was going on in your mind when you jumped?

The jump takes so long that you actually have the time to think ‘Oh God, I am going to die'… but, it was fun. I did it just once. In fact, I've not done a more physically and emotionally challenging film in my career. Shooting drains you, but you feel nice when you return home; you feel you've achieved something.

Could you connect to the mythological Raavan while playing this character?

Look, the film is not like any other film. However, it has glimpses of mythology, just like any other film. When I told Mani people will draw comparisons, he asked me to name one film that wasn't influenced by mythology. And, I couldn't! But, Raavan is a modern film. It is not inspired by any other character or contemporary leader. He is just a character Mani came up with.

But your character Beera is spoken of as having 10 heads… just like Raavan.

The ten heads refer to ten personalities — there are ten different facets that are easily referred to as dus sar. Incidentally, Beera's pet name in the film is Raavan. Beera is like an animal — he is wild and unpredictable. He's the most fun guy I've ever played. We actors make character sketches so we can follow them in deciding what a character would and wouldn't do. For example, there are certain things Gurukant Desai (Guru) could do and couldn't. But, Beera will be laughing one minute, and the next, there'll be anger on his face. The fun thing about Beera is there's nothing he won't do; he can get away with anything.

How was it to work with Mani Ratnam for the third time — after Yuva and Guru?

You are in awe of him because of what he brings to the table, but the moment he says cut, he becomes this close friend. His favourite line is ‘Keep it real, make it real'. While you are standing in five feet of freezing water, with snakes swimming around and leeches sticking to you, Mani says: ‘Do anything, but make it a convincing performance'. If you are standing under the waterfall or on a hostile terrain, you'll find Mani leading from the front, standing in waist-deep water himself. If he can do it, who are you to not?

Were you scared for Aishwarya that she too had to do stunts, as in the song ‘Behne de'?

You know what? Half-way through rough terrains, she was the one guiding me as to where to place my feet. In fact, she's the film's hero; Dev and Beera are the heroines. She was helping Kenny (actor Vikram) sir too. Kenny and I'd watch her stunts wondering: ‘kaise karti hai re? (hey, how does she do it?)'. Not just stunts, she picks up everything in a jiffy — think dance steps. So much so that after our three- or four-day dance rehearsals, our performance is judged against hers!

How is it to act with your wife?

It's great to work with one of the finest actors and one of the most dedicated professionals in the country. But, the best part is, the moment Mani announces ‘pack up', I'm with my wife!

1117,A method in madness,SHELLEY WALIA,2010-05-06,19:14:59 IST,"Jonathan Littell's novel The Kindly Ones is a translation of the French version published in 2006. Ever since its publication, it has achieved a monumental status both in France and the rest of the world with its grim World War II plot. It concerns the life of Maximilien Aue who unemotionally participates in the Nazi atrocities, and has been at Auschwitz and at Berlin during the Allied attacks. As Littell aptly puts it, his hero is a ‘roving X-Ray, a scanner', more of a machine than human to whom the landscape is as important as the gas chambers.The novel is largely a reworking of the Orestia myth where after killing his mother Clytemnestra, Orestes is hounded by the Furies. At the end of the Greek play, the Furies are appeased and metamorphose into Eumenides which literally means ‘the oindly ones'. Orestes goes free and unpunished just as Aue, who, on the one hand, is an obedient slave of the genocide machinery, and on the other, becomes a reliable and an objective narrator of the Nazi crime, claiming that genocide paradoxically has behind it the impetus of “calm, collected'' ordinary people. Though addressed to his ‘human brothers' the book seeks answers to the reason why such heartless cruelty exists in the world. As Aue maintains: ‘Now of course the war is over. And we've learned our lesson, it won't happen again. But are you quite sure we've learned our lesson? Are you certain it won't happen again?' He goes on to argue: ‘There are psychopaths everywhere, all the time. Our quiet suburbs are crawling with pedophiles and maniacs, our homeless shelters are packed with raving megalomaniacs …and then the very same State that would without batting an eye send them to war crushes them like a blood-swollen mosquito. These sick men are nothing. But the ordinary men that make up the State— especially in unstable times — now there's the real danger. The real danger for mankind is me, is you.'
Contrasts
Guilty of murder and matricide, he remains happily oblivious of his role, busy as he is in the concluding years of his life employed as a Director in a lace factory. Loss of memory of his past is interestingly in contrast with his clear memory of the Nazi madness and the horror of those years of destruction. He is located inside the story of Germany and yet becomes the clear headed analyst from the vantage point of an outsider. Aue's account of Germany war history takes up much of the book. On the other hand the story of his private life as a homosexual incestuously craving for anal sex with his twin sister never reaches any conclusive end.Finally, the book leaves the reader with an open-ended world of questions to a phenomenon that has intrigued the world for decades: why did the very responsible and often learned Nazi supporters back such a terrible programme of extermination. Certainly, not because of the anti-Semitic ideology, nor a personal grouse against the Jews. Justice and responsibility are after all not all that unambiguously simple concepts to deal with. The theme of dichotomy of passion and indifference draws the reader simultaneously to understand the crime and to condemn it.In doing his work, the war criminal does not hate the people he executes, nor is he taking revenge on them or killing them because they are a threat to him. As in the case of Aue, there is no revulsion, shame or guilt. Nevertheless he compares the American soldier in Vietnam with the Nazis: “he is ‘just like you,' and people like you are capable of carrying out even the most horrific acts when the circumstances demand it. If you are an American, consider your little Vietnam adventure, which so traumatized your fellow citizens. You lost fifty thousand troops there in ten years… I obviously am not including the Vietnamese dead; since you never speak of them, in your books or TV programs.… In a total war there can be no civilians, only the fight of one mass against another. In such a fight every participant is equally guilty: the killers with blood on their hands and the supply officers who fuel the trucks. You might have died rather than shoot, but would you have died rather than pump gasoline?”The story derives its significance from the complex notions of justice, guilt and responsibility and takes us back to the controversy over Hannah Arendt's article “Eichmann in Jerusalem” (1963) on Adolf Eichmann's trial. The book becomes intellectually challenging when seen in terms of the sense of duty when the crime begins to take on another shade of the responsibility of action. Within the ambit of one's duty lies the question of behaviour according to the demands of the job in hand even if it means death for some. This is the central paradox of any discussion on the philosophical issue of ethics and duty.
Going beyond
Aue's involvement, like Eichmann's, in sending hundreds of Jews to the gas chambers does not give him any pangs of conscience, but is the result of a deep-seated desire to fulfill the demands of an assignment. Personal feelings or the sense of morality are not permitted to interfere with the sense of duty.To Arendt, it was more a case of thoughtlessness, than a ‘monstrosity', an incapacity to ‘think from the point of view of others.' And Littell elaborates on this idea through a fictional work that is at once history as an eyewitness account as well as a critique of passive acceptance of a role that the state imposes on individuals who headlong turn into cogs in the wheels of the state apparatus.On the human level the choices we make determine our destiny and define our ideological stance. Rules are too conventional and narrow in scope to cover the paradoxes and ironies of our existence.

1118,A longing for ease,SOFIA GHORI SALEEM,2010-05-06,19:13:02 IST,"Another Gulmohar Tree written by Aamer Hussein, is a story two people from across the continents who build a life together of quest, commitment and ultimate reward. Lydia is an English woman who meets Usman, a Pakistani writer 10 years her senior, at a socialist seminar in Bloomsbury. She decides to follow Usman back to Pakistan and eventually marries him and settles down in Karachi. The story tells about Lydia's many, seemingly easy adjustments, and adaptations to her new life and culture. Usman, on the other hand, appears to struggle with his life, his career and his family.The book describes the couple to be “Puzzled angels, visiting earth on holiday, lost until you finally find each other.” Lydia certainly comes through as an angel who forsakes her career, her language, culture, religion and country for the sake of her love for a foreign man. She is portrayed as a woman who hits the ground running and changes her name, religion, dress and even learns Urdu, all this before meeting her man again or being certain of a marriage proposal by him.One wonders whether this is the kind of confluence of east and west, people of cross cultural experience desire – a lasting commitment from a western woman whose transformation, acceptance and level of comfort with the eastern culture is so total – its a bit unbelievable. Is this realistic to expect? Can it sustain over long periods of time?Rokeya's (as Lydia now calls herself) experiences with her new culture are not elaborated upon. Her frustrations and learning experiences are foreign to the reader. Rokeya never pines for her native home or her family – except for shedding a tear when her father sends a birthday card late.Her remarkable integration is more seamless that most expatriates returning to their homeland. The book also raises the question: what is the inherent value of someone willing to change so much and demand so little. It's interesting that this book talks about the ease of adjustment when immigrating back to Pakistan just as his previous book Insomnia dwells on some of its difficulties.
Insomnia and Other Stories is a collection of short stories set in no particular place or chronological order. The main protagonist in many of the stories is a Pakistani named Murad. Many of the stories trace the life story of Murad from a young, awkward, impressionable student to a mature writer in his middle age. Hussein writes much about writers themselves in the stories “The Book of Maryam”, the “Angelic Disposition”, “Insomnia” , and “Hibiscus Days”.Hussein returns to certain central themes over and over again in his writings – the flaming Gulmohar tree, the blood red Hibiscus bush.He writes about the right to dream and the choice to serve – about disillusionment and untimely death. He examines friendships and discontinuity and the lonely life of writing. His preoccupation with writing is evident in his recurrent return to this theme.Seclusion seems to be the lot of his writers – sometimes chosen, sometimes accidental, as well as longing and a sense of not belonging. Of living in the fabric of a society and yet pulling back. These are stories about people who share the same intellectual and emotional space and inspire each other to write. Friends that form a network, or a safety blanket if you will, to nurture, coax and egg one on towards goals. All of his writer subjects are middle aged and single or divorced or childless as stated in one of the stories.The “Book of Maryam” quotes from the Quran – the story of the birth of Jesus.In “The Angelic Disposition”, the protagonist takes comfort in the strength of her husband's unquestioning support to grieve for a man who was never more than a friend. She counts on her rosary (tasbeeh) 33 times, then 33 times, then 33 times again, not the names of her Lord, but the words of her friend. The story makes reference to the Christian belief of Satan being a fallen angel – and that angels should never grow old.“Insomnia” is about melancholy, grief and soul searching, death and devastation, where the silence stretches on waiting for the phone to ring for the next encounter with a friend.Aamer Hussein's stories live in the cutting edge of loneliness, pain and a heightened need to communicate every shiny raindrop, every pearly teardrop, every flaming bush and singing thrush.They make you think - about cultural boundaries, about the passage from youth to middle age, about being a foreigner in a different land. About Wars, earthquakes, tsunamis – naturals disasters, death and darkness. About the fallibility of relationships. About feelings and futility.And they remind you of the poem “Spring and Fall – to a Young Child” byGerard Manley Hopkins : Margaret, are you grieving Over Goldengrove unleaving?

1119,In the dying light,K. SRILATA,2010-05-06,19:12:02 IST,"“ I have now set out to do the things / you loved most about me./About a gift called poetry… I have set about writing, / what you perhaps would most love me to do - / write about you,” says Gopikrishnan Kottoor. “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” (a sequence of poems that forms part of the larger collection Victoria Terminus) is a tribute to the poet's dying father.That Kottoor should have given himself the permission to write these poems about his father as the latter lay in coma following a brain hemorrhage may be hard for some to understand. But then the poet tells us in no uncertain terms that this is just what his father would have wanted him to do, that, in fact, his father is more than just his muse-of-the-moment. In “saving” the poet's poems on his shelf “as though poems were pigeons/and needed a home,” the older man has nurtured his son's work, offering “a carving of [his] bone/to hone [his] poems upon”.It is at once easy and unimaginably hard to work with subjects so intensely personal, hard to write of events that unfold even as you write. That these poems travel so well is a tribute to Kottoor's abilities as a poet. Images of Christ's crucifixion intertwine with the journey into the ICU of the poet's father: “I remember you laughing your way into the ICU /Like Christ never did upon the cobbled stones.” Oddly touching even if sometimes over the top, the poems in “Father”, “Wake Us”, “In Passing” succeed in holding you. There is a sensuous quality to Kottoor's work best exemplified perhaps by the poem “The Man in the Mist”: “Someday these tears will end ./ What began as a wild desire, a wetness under the forest leaves , /turns cold, the sun takes on the words/spoken by the lips of rain, / the fragrances of bright hidden flowers/mating in the open air.” The images are fragile, evocative. One wonders though why Kottoor (with just a few exceptions) avoids the Malayalam kinship terms for father and mother.The second section - “Mother Sonata” – is also meant to be read as a sequence of poems. The poems here are reflections on pain, death and dying and, in this case, it is the poet's mother to whom the poems pay tribute. There are some weak poems in this section. Excessively sentimental and flowery, “Fairy Child” is particularly disappointing: “You were so good to lay my fairy child-head on / When I put my arms around you / you cradled me with misted clouds ,/ as upon lost mountain blues” may pass muster if written by an amateur poet. This inconsistency is somewhat puzzling.“Painted Wagons Rolling”, which forms the third section of the anthology, contains some of Kottoor's best poems. The “millipedes curling up” that emerge in the poem “Digging” testify to the “worship” that “mud-work” is. These mostly invisible creatures of the soil do their “odd jobs” in much the same way, presumably, that a poet does his.For a poet too digs – in his case, for meaning that would otherwise lie buried. The poems in this section boast of a range that is understandably lacking in the earlier two sections, containing reflections on dead poets and what survives their death to sharply satirical portraits triggered by an old boy's reunion.The last section “Victoria Terminus”, planned as another sequence, takes us on board Mumbai's local trains. We look out of the window to see old men defecating, while inside the compartment we meet card players intent on their game despite the fact of there being “not enough floor/to even straighten toes.” We also encounter deaths and bomb blasts - all the stories, big and small, that make up the Mumbai local. While one appreciates the spirit behind these Mumbai local vignettes, one can't help wishing that Kottoor had been more careful in his crafting and diction.

1120,‘I’ve always been a writer’,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,19:11:03 IST,"RAHULMEHTA: Coming out.
  | Photo Credit: g mail Rahul Mehta’s short-story collection Quarantine is about young gay men and their relationships with their families and lovers. Written with unusual tenderness and insight, the book represents a coming out of sorts for Mehta, a U.S.-based lecturer whose relatives in India don’t yet know that he is homosexual.
When did you first develop an interest in writing, and specifically creative writing?
I’ve always been a writer. Even when I was 13 or 14, I was telling people that I was going to be a writer. In ninth grade once, we had to do a research project on a career that we were interested in. When we had to submit our proposals for our projects, I chose “writer”, and my teacher wrote back, “That’s not a career. Choose something else.” So I shadowed an advertising executive.To be fair to my teacher, I don’t think she was necessarily trying to discourage me. I think she was just trying to get me to be practical, to save me from a difficult path. Much later, in grad school, one of my professors said a similar thing. She said she always tells her students who want to become writers, “If you can do something else, do it. If you can’t: God help you, and welcome.”
At risk of sounding reductive, was there a connection between your initial realisation that you were gay and your taking up writing? Did writing help you come to terms with your sexuality?
I do think that there is a connection. Being gay forced me early on to question one of the most fundamental aspects of who I am. Naturally, that sense of inquiry extended to other areas as well. I think it led me to ask bigger questions about everything around me. I once had this boss who, ticking items off on her fingers, said, “Gay, Indian, raised in West Virginia…of course you ended up a writer.” I think what she meant was that it was only natural for me to turn to writing as a way to try to make sense of these various experiences and these various selves.
Were these stories written to announce your sexual identity in a public space? Or was the sexual orientation of the characters incidental to the whole?
My intent, always, first and foremost, is to tell a compelling story. Sure, I’m drawn to certain types of narratives and characters, but I never set out writing a story with a specific purpose other than to craft a compelling narrative. In fact, I rarely even know what a story is going to be about when I sit down to write it. The seed for a story is usually a first line that I find interesting in some way; that has some tension, perhaps in the sounds of the words or in the relationship between characters. Then I let whatever tension is inherent in that sentence lead me to what should come next. At least with first drafts, I’m very much a sentence-to-sentence writer.A writer I admire named Gary Lutz once described a similar process. He said when writing a sentence he generally puts down a word and then he tries to figure out what word that first word yearns for. That’s the word he used: “yearns.” I love that.
This is a work about marginalised people in general, not just gay people: your depictions of lonely, elderly people are very empathetic. Are you particularly interested in themes like isolation and personal dislocation?
Yes, absolutely. I do think those are themes and characters I’m particularly drawn to. Perhaps it comes from my growing up feeling so much like an outsider — brown-skinned in a small West Virginian town that was overwhelmingly white — and witnessing so many of my relatives and Indian family friends who seemed, in some way or another, to be outside as well. I grew up with my father’s parents living in our house. I often wondered what it might have felt like to them to land in this tiny southern American town after five decades of living in Mumbai.
There is a bit of sex in the book, but nothing that’s very explicit. Was that a conscious decision?
Several people have made this comment to me, that there isn’t much sex in the book and that what’s there is tasteful. I’m glad to hear it. What it says to me is that the sex doesn’t jump out or distract or hijack the narratives which, as we’ve discussed, aren’t really about sexuality at all. I think my mom would disagree with you, though. Just yesterday she was complaining to me, “Why so much sex?” But maybe, being my mother, she reads it differently than the typical reader. At any rate, I didn’t make a conscious decision one way or another about how much sex to include in the book. But I do think it’s really tough to write about sex.
The tone of the stories “The Cure” and “What We Mean” is more wry and playful than the others, though they are both very poignant in their own ways. Were you trying to be more experimental when you wrote them?
Yes, I do think both those stories have a somewhat different feel – they are much more language-driven than plot-driven. They are of a piece with a slew of shorter works (two to four pages long) that my editor and I eventually decided to cut from the collection because they seemed too different in tone and style than the other stories. Writing these pieces, I was very much influenced by writers like Lutz, whom I mentioned earlier, as well as Lydia Davis, Christine Schutt, Diane Williams and Amy Hempel — writers whose sentences have a sculptural quality and a close attention to sound.
What is your overall impression of attitudes towards homosexuality in India? The Supreme Court judgement legalising homosexuality last year was a welcome step, but it also caused paranoia in conservative circles. Then there was the recent case of a professor who committed suicide after being secretly videotaped having sex with another man.
I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Dr. Siras, and I was shocked by the vicious harassment he endured from the students. Does this event, and the paranoia and uproar you referred to, reflect widespread attitudes toward LGBT people in India? I’m not sure. But what I do know is that I’ve travelled all over India with my partner, Robert, and we’ve rarely felt comfortable being truly open about our relationship. At the same time, Robert and I feel the same discomfort in non-urban areas of the U.S. as well. If we are travelling in America, we will never check into a motel in a small town and ask for a single, king-sized bed. We always take the room with two double beds without making a fuss about it.
Have many of your relatives in India read the book?
I’ve been a total coward when it comes to talking to my relatives in India about the book or about my sexual orientation. I still haven’t told them about either. If they’ve seen the book or seen any of the press, they haven’t mentioned it to me. Honestly, I don’t know how they will react. I guess I’ll find out when I come to India next month. But I have faith in them. I know that they love me, and in the end I do think that that trumps everything. Whatever political and social hang-ups people may have, if they love you, they find a way to understand. I’ve seen this again and again with people in my life. And of course, this extends far beyond sexual orientation. Family members who truly love one another accept each other for who they are, whatever that might be.
Do you read much Indian writing in English? Is there anyone whose work you’re especially impressed by?
Arundhati Roy is basically a minor deity in my eyes. The God of Small Things is one of my all-time favourite novels, and her non-fiction writings and her social and political activism are tremendous inspirations to me. Her work is swelling with generosity and kindness. There are so many works by Indian writers from which I’ve taken inspiration — Vikram Seth’s Golden Gate, Amitav Ghosh’s Shadow Lines, and Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children come to mind. More recently I’ve loved Pankaj Mishra’s The Romantics, Githa Hariharan’s In Times of Siege, and the Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist (which I teach in one of my classes). As for poetry, I love Arun Kolatkar’s Jejuri as well as anything by Agha Shahid Ali.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/lsquoIrsquove-always-been-a-writerrsquo/article16298815.ece
1121,Still going strong,BAGESHREE S.,2010-05-06,19:08:20 IST,"The Select Bookshop, Bangalore. Photo: G. RAGHAV
  The bookstore boom in Bangalore has meant the arrival of big corporate chains which offer a lot beside books. But these have in no way dimmed the charm of the much-loved antiquarian book store of Bangalore, The Select Bookshop started way back in 1945. If anything, the old world store off Brigade Road seems more precious than ever before, no less than a landmark of the city.
A wide variety
The store is crammed with unusual and rare second-hand books on a variety of topics ranging from Oriental literature to architecture and gardening. What makes the store extra special is its amiable owner, K.K.S. Murthy, who knows every book, and more often than not, will tell you an interesting story or two on how he came to acquire it.The shop was started by Murthy's bibliophile father K.B.K. Rao, who turned his love for collecting books into a business enterprise. He often travelled from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh to Bangalore to pick out rare books at auctions and eventually started Select here. Mr. Murthy, who was working as an aeronautical engineer in the United States, followed his father's footsteps into the book trade in the 1970s.Even as he worked in New Jersey, Mr. Murthy's weekends were dedicated to scouting for precious books for his father back home. He can vividly recall chancing upon some “extraordinary rejects” in the backyard of Barnes and Noble, such as a rare collection of Carl Jung's writings.Over the years Select has retains its dedicated clientele and new people keep walking in, having heard of this quaint place by word of mouth. The shop has had its share of illustrious customers, including C.V. Raman, Philip Spratt, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar and Ruskin Bond.Select now also has its own imprint, which has brought out some valuable books such as a reprint of Ananda Coomaraswamy's Time and Eternity. The first floor of the shop is an art gallery.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Still-going-strong/article16298814.ece
1122,Some rare gems,SHALINI SHAH,2010-05-06,19:07:16 IST,"Space for all: At the Oxford Bookstore, Delhi.
  While dedicated antique bookshops are rare, digging around old bookstores, one can come across some gems. Paramount Book Store on Janpath, New Delhi, is one such store. Ask owner Naresh Kambiri about antique books and he produces a fragile International Library of Famous Literature carefully wrapped in a dusty plastic bag. One of 20, the book had been edited by Dr. Richard Garnett of the British Museum and was published in 1900. Rare books by Kashmiri Sufi saint Lalla Rukh are available too. But there isn't much of a demand. “We've only been getting enquiries, that too mostly from foreigners,” says Kambiri.The Oxford Bookstore has a section on antique and rare books. These include first editions, limited editions, rare publications and out-of-print books. It is interesting to see tomes like Voyages and Travels: India, Ceylon, The Red Sea, Abyssinia and Egypt (first printed in 1811), A New Account of the East Indies: 1688 to 1723 (first printed in 1739), India and its Native Princes: Travels in Central India and in the Presidencies of Bombay and Bengal by Louis Rousselet (1875) and A History of the Indian Mutiny by G.W. Forrest (first printed in 1904) resting alongside the latest books.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Some-rare-gems/article16298813.ece
1123,A bunch of blooms,SHREEKUMAR VARMA,2010-05-06,19:05:40 IST,"It is one thing to gather a bouquet, and quite another to conjure up a bunch of surprisingly different blooms, that satisfies because of its variety and freshness. Penguin's First Proof 5is a gathering of personal voices that explore moods and relationships, challenges and statistics through fiction, nonfiction and a pinch of verse.
Stunning start
It begins with the stunning story of Ruma, prostitute by day, housewife by night, an activist who yet surrenders to the pressures of husband and family. Bishakha Datta's straightforward prose brings alive the paradox in the life of a woman whose sacrifices may never be recognised by society as we have it today. Samanth Subramaniam's “Hunting the Sailfish” culls tense drama through minimalist narrative, reportage that simmers beneath the surface. Hemingway's ghost looms over us because of the subject, philosophy and sparseness of expression.What follows in the nonfiction section is a quick-fire portrait of jungle-king Veerappan, his interactions with people he's kidnapped. And an interesting sketch of Kutch with its paling borders of landscape, language and people, followed by a very objective study by three women of women who want to have “fun”, the problems they face while occupying space without “purpose”. Editor-in-chief of The New Indian ExpressAditya Sinha's brutally frank forays into family history and latent homosexuality can only result in his being forever persona non grata with a clutch of rankled relatives. Vamsee Juluri's study of non-violence and “Munnabhai” examines the proffered meaning of Gandhi's heritage and its scope, concluding that cinema is still its one faithful follower. Satnam's sojourn in the Bastar jungle is next, along with communist guerrillas, an account of the routine life of militants, with mild, off-the-cuff observations: “A fortress-like structure had been erected with tree branches and bamboo, where the guerrillas practise destroying such fortifications”.And so to fiction.The first offering is K.R. Meera's “Ave Maria”, a brutal glimpse into the debris of Kerala's Communist ideology, the fault lines left behind in families. “The Imaginary Friend” tells of a man and his little cousin, a train journey that shows how the mind can make or break. “The Brass Tumbler” follows the tradition of classic Hindi fiction, the story of an heirloom whose history mirrors (or causes) a family's upheavals.
Exquisite stories
The two stories that follow are gems. Completely different in tone and setting, they scream out the need for love and freedom, of belonging and recognition, women's outpourings that yearn for choices within the patriarchal claustrophobia. Bakul Mukhtiar's tale of an extra-marital relationship is sparse and evocative, like the room where the liaisons take place. And Swarnalatha Rangarajan's “Hiranmayi” is a tale lushly told, of an era gone by, child marriages and dark rooms, stark lives lit by hope, wives abandoned by terribly traditional in-laws.Relief comes with Cheryl-Ann Couto's “Slim Pickings”, hilarious and acutely observed, a warmth that dissipates unbelievably in the echoes of an old tragedy. “The Last Supper In Delhi” is elegantly told, of high living in the Capital, of art and partying, surprise end to a year-end celebration. “The Dining Table” is the story of memory and family, and “Bankru't” takes place in Indonesia with discussions about West Bengal's politics and economics, finally reaching an unexpected twist which can only bring resolution.Radha Nair's “A Grand Repast” takes an admiring look at an uncle in a Kerala household, a connoisseur whose fanatic enjoyment of cooked fish is a celebration of life.
Poetic takes
Manash Bhattacharya's three poems use sudden words and conceits, juggling up images and whimsical insight to commemorate love. (“But I remember how you had first/ stirred inside my head like a child/ in a sick mother's womb.”) And Radha Sinha's two poems conclude the book, straightforward and resonant: “Love songs remind me of you and I when we weren't us./ We were mad, free. We were our children./ Now all they do is remind me of what we'll never be.”First Proof 5is a book worth returning to, though one wishes someone had given it a second proof-reading.

1124,Flavours of the north-east,RANJITA BISWAS,2010-05-06,19:04:33 IST,"The debate over whether a translated work destroys the flavour of the original is long over, one assumes. Thankfully! Without translation, voices from around the world, excluding English or any major language, would have been confined into cocoons. In India itself, regional literature is of great dimension. But for the translations, lovers of literature would have been in a limbo to taste local flavours.For instance, the Assamese language, mainly spoken in the Brahmaputra Valley has a rich literary tradition. Contemporary Assamese short stories are some of the best in the country today, acknowledge litterateurs basing their view on the limited number of translations available in English.
Varied themes
Well-known journalist and translator Dhirendra Nath Bezboruah's A Game of Chess, a compilation of fifteen stories, gives a glimpse of the richness and variety of themes in modern Assamese short stories. Starting with “The Decision” by Syed Abdul Malik, a path-breaking writer from the 1950s, which etches a delightful cameo of a woman (Aimoni) with a mind of her own, and wrapped up with “Parable of an Ancient Triangle” by young writer Moushumi Kandali on the dilemma of a feminist and her student, the anthology covers a wide range of human situations.Within this range figure some of the most famous short stories in contemporary Assamese language. Bhabendra Nath Saikia, who ushered in a new era in Assamese literature in the 1960s with his insightful observation of the human character and situation, features in three stories. ‘The Cavern” is a sardonic look at such a situation as a White supremacy believer's heart gets transplanted by a Black man's heart and its effect on him, in an oblique reference to South Africa which was still practising Apartheid and where also the world's first heart transplant took place.“A Game of Chess” by Saurabh Kumar Chaliha, known for his eclectic choice of themes, plays another kind of psychological game with two friends, one successful, the other loser, over a chess-board. His “Bonsai” – on modern society's penchant for consumerism and clever marketing ploys by manufacturers with affordable mini versions of products - ‘sachets' of shampoo or coffee available even in rural backwaters, leaves one wondering – would people enjoy mini-literature, mini-bananas, etc?Jnanpith Award winner Indira Goswami's “The Journey”, Atulananda Goswami's “Munni's Legs” and Harekrishna Deka's “The Prisoner” are reflections on the unstable state of affairs in the region due to the long-drawn insurgency and conflict and their effect on ordinary people.Manoj Goswami's sheering “Samiran Borua is on His Way” resonates with the sighs of idealists anywhere, left behind by a society moving on while they themselves lose their youth and home hoping to change an unjust society.
Global feel
The locale of Arupa Patagia Kalita's “A Nymph of the Desert” moves from the lush green valley of Assam to the arid desert of Rajasthan but the theme of urban-rural divide, of anorexic socialites and starving desert women, can be placed anywhere – even today, and perhaps more so in this global-economic village.Apurba Sharma's “Monica and Vikram” drawing on one of the India's famous myth story characters — Betaal and Vikramaditya, to transplant into a modern version is an interesting experiment but the story is too long and at times gets tedious with social comments verging on lectures on social ills.By the translator-editor's own admission, the anthology does not make “claims of ..being a representative collection of any era or period of time” but chosen because he felt ‘impelled' to translate them. “It is possible to have forty or fifty anthologies of good Assamese short stories in translation,” he writes in the preface. Yet the book gives a worthy glimpse into the wealth of this literature from the North East.The meticulous translation with an eye to maintaining the local flavour, a glossary of local words and their meanings, and profiles of the original authors add to the value to the book.

1125,Rich encounters,VIJAY NAMBISAN,2010-05-06,19:03:29 IST,"It so happened that I read this book at a time when I was having to speak five languages on a daily basis. None of them was new; but reading this made me aware of what I was doing. I could almost sense the different brain paths in use, and I was certainly sensible of a different cultural approach to each. It was the best way – and one I could never have planned – to appreciate Rich's experience of learning Hindi from scratch.
Writerly forays
Rich's background is with magazines, not academics. Why she chose to learn Hindi is never clearly spelled out. She'd lost her job, and was recovering from cancer. (She wrote an award-winning book about her battle with “The Red Devil”.) She lied to an editor who'd asked her for some freelance work, saying “I'll be in India,” and was told, “Do something for us there.”From Delhi, she was sent to an academy in Udaipur which taught foreign students. She arrived at a difficult time: five days before the attacks on New York, and that was followed in short order by the attack on Parliament, then came Godhra and the subsequent carnage. Her magazine background serves her well. She details with painstaking and sometimes painful honesty her reactions to the hatred spewed by fanatics everywhere, the branding of humans by community. There was then a palpable, shimmering unease in the air which she describes elegantly.Personal relationships are her metier. Her depictions of social dynamics at the language academy, with her various local hosts, among the expats, at a school for deaf children – all these leaven the narrative and make absorbing reading. She also has a gift for concisely expressing complex ideas. What adds great value is her attempts, before and after her Indian sojourn, to pin down the physiology of language skills. She has spoken to and read many experts, with almost as many theories. She offers these lucidly and convincingly where relevant to her story.
An instance, at random:
Recently, a cognitive neurolinguist at the University of Washington made an extraordinary discovery about the extent to which our brains understand more than we can say. [He] scanned neophyte French students… using a device that measures electrical activity in the brain. At two weeks in, after test participants had received only eight hours of instruction, [he] attached electrodes to their scalps and showed them lists of words. Some were French, some made up. When they were asked to say which were which, they did as expected: scored, on average, 50 per cent. They guessed…. But the scans showed their brains were getting the answers right.There are too many such remarkable findings to quote in a review.Rich falls into many of the traps India sets for Westerners. There is the inapposite caste-naming, for example: “the pretty Brahmin teacher”. When she wants to talk to “a dalit”, any dalit, she is warned off by an instructor. Is it so difficult, finding “a dalit”? There are outdated notions of Indian women living a secret life. (This is perhaps not so outdated in Rajasthan. But then she shouldn't talk of “Indian women”.)To be fair, she makes her own bloomers too. She confuses the Indian Congress with the American idea; says south Indian languages are as far from Hindi as English is from Mandarin; describes the charkha as having adorned the Indian flag for many years…. And ye gods, her spellings: “atmaan, Brahmaan”, “mendhi”, “Vidyala” – I wonder why, if Westland must reprint an American book for us, they can't correct these things.Though Rich achieved, in some measure, her dream of dreaming in Hindi, her language skills cannot be very considerable. Her Hindi is of that Sanskritic order which is taught in schools, and rings quaintly to the man in the street. Rajasthan is not the best place to learn the lingua Indica. Her English, too, like that of so many American writers (and Indian journalists), is often found to settle for the approximate rather than the exact. On the same page I find “a trifling” used for “a trifle” and “precedence” for “precedent”.But working polyglots, unlike academics and UN interpreters, need to communicate, not dazzle. It is Rich's journey that is fascinating. She did not undertake it for any material reward (though this book must be selling), but for the excitement of what she discovered along the way. That is its own reward, both for her and the reader. A professional academic would have written a more factually accurate account. She would have used more method. She would also, nine times out of ten, have been boring. It is precisely Rich's peripatetic approach that gives this book its charm. So long as it is not used as a guide – but that is, unfortunately, just how the unwary and lazy will use it. Bhai, zaraa dekhke chalo.
Vijay Nambisan's translations of two 16th century Kerala poems were published last year.

1126,Celebrating the academic poet,M.S. NAGARAJAN,2010-05-06,19:01:30 IST,"Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a short anthology of seventy-five “lyrical poems with soft, sensuous and passionate lines” composed on different occasions spanning a period of nearly three decades. She has had the advantage of getting to know, rather intimately, her contemporaries, poets who helped shape her poems, offering suggestions and putting her on the right track.Nissim Ezekiel who was a pathfinder for many of the younger generation brought her into contact with Gieve Patel, Kamala Das, Dom Moraes and others. Arun Kolatkar and Adil Jussawalla too had their bit of role in promoting her poems. More than all, the academic circle she grew up in afforded a lot of exposure to good and great poetry. In this sense, it is right to place her among the group of Indian academic poets of the post-independence era.Her early ‘Catholic' poems from her collection Fix are autobiographical—if not confessional—in nature, helping us gain a peep into the nature of her later poetry.The beliefs and disbeliefs of the Goan-Catholic community of Mumbaikars provide her with enough material for a conducted tour, as it were, of the inner lives of this group of people. “Catholic Mother” provides four biting — if not scornful — snapshots of her family. The father believes that God always provides for that big family of seven young children. According to the parish priest, he is the pillar of the church, and for Mother Superior, it is a lovely Catholic family. The last line that her mother ‘says nothing' is ambivalent. Profoundly intimate, yet aesthetically distant, is the poem an acceptance or a denial of father's role and presence? The poet stands outside in a distanced position from which she can apprehend the fallacies of both positions.Institutionalised religious morality and subjective personal judgments can both fall outside the domain of true experience of human life.Eunice De Souza's poems are narrative in style, simple and direct oftentimes but the ideas they explore are not as simple as all that. The poem “Mid Sentence” from her collection of “Recent Poems” is illustrative of this mode. There is no wailing, no sentimental cries. There is just the banal closing line; ‘It was thoughtless to vanish so suddenly,' referring to the sudden passing away of someone (Finis. Kaput. Dead.) whose identity is not revealed. There is a commingling of a joyous life full of hope and expectation with the sudden close with ‘neither harp nor halo.'The lyric expands the metaphor of the opening line, “You left mid-sentence…” Death looms large in the anthology the title of which (“A Necklace of Skulls”) seems deliberate.The influence of William Blake on Eunice De Souza is unmistakable: the two of the longest poems, “Songs of Survival” and “Songs of Innocence” bear an echo of Blake. But unlike Blake who portrays complementary and opposing views on the transcendent mystery of creation as in “The Lamb” and “The Tyger,” these two companion pieces present related views enquiring into the phenomena of innocence and survival.Standing outside the two perceptions, the poet explores the limitations of being ‘happy with him forever/in this world and the next,' (innocence), while denouncing the self-deprecating attitudes, extols the philosophy of stoicism and the Schopenhauerean virtues of the will to live. The poems of De Souza are well-wrought lyrics, inflexible and firm, short in design. In fact the very economy of utterances helps her in arriving at such a delicately finished form.Full of understatements, avoiding any external aid in the form of conceits, metaphors or symbols, Eunice De Souza's A Necklace of Skulls is a welcome addition to the Indo-Anglian shelf.

1127,Too many loose ends,SAAZ AGGARWAL,2010-05-06,18:59:44 IST,"The House on Mall Road
  Parvati is 27-years-old and this is the story of a journey she makes to try and find out what exactly happened 20 years ago when tragedy irretrievably changed her circumstances.Travelling with her, we learn something about life in an army cantonment near the border and the dangers that we, sitting comfortably curled up and reading novels, are safe from. The discipline, the atmosphere of wide spaces, smartly-uniformed personnel of every rank, the abundance of various resources, the monotonous routine, the deceptively jolly and rotund officers (eagle-eyed and razor-sharp is what they really are) and the wonderfully warm but empty-headed and appearance-obsessed women (yes, some of them can be vicious and career-ruining spiteful too) are plainly described. We also discern shades of the emotional spectrum of army life – not just pride in country and fearlessness in the face of peril but also the unique conflicts within the ranks and between other groups such as police and civilians, and the classless society formed by people from so many different backgrounds.Romance enters Parvati’s story in a straightforward way but you will wait in vain for what would once have been a logical conclusion. And while you may consider this the mark of a modern story, in many ways, and particularly in its use of language, this book is anachronistic.What is it about the IIM-A novelists? Is it that difficult to put a good story together using a healthy, global – or even consistently local – idiom? With Chetan Bhagat, the story roars along without even pretending to strive for a style that could be admired. This book, on the other hand, has nothing that either Wren or Martin could object to. However, it is strewn with dated expressions like “attaché” case and “reel” for photo film roll; malapropisms as in “I am mortified of snakes”; ill-chosen adjectives as in “no offence to your fabulous profession” and the word “nice” (which shrewd writers will display before a reviewer only, and only, as a remedy for constipation) FOUR TIMES on one page – oh my god! Occasional lapses into new age concepts (“personal boundaries”; “but in a nice way”) evoke the precocious child trying out a new word, proud and a little self-conscious.If your benchmark of a good book is that, from one end to the other, you feel the characters as real people and can experience them change or grow, you will have one more reason to feel disappointed. The people here are static and at most capable of performing random unexpected acts. The narrator herself fails to claim your being, as a skilled narrator would – she’s somewhat shadowy, a tinselly voice and at best a collection of opinions.I did enjoy the series of implausible coincidences (but then truth is always stranger than fiction) and the surge of emotion towards the end of the book. However, too many loose ends were left hanging: strange happenings that are never explained and even the ghost of someone who hadn’t died after all. This book lacks the grace of a natural story. If I wasn’t reading it as a reviewer, I would never have carried on to the end.Reading Pico Iyer’s enthusiastic endorsement on the cover, I had grabbed it with excitement, anticipating the matchless pleasure of reading a wonderful first book by a talented new writer of fiction. As I read, however, excitement turned to disbelief, and then to annoyance.I’ve always been a fan of Pico Iyer’s elegant writing style. His words flow smooth and pleasing, unassuming, and often stunningly effective. I’m afraid that his description of this mediocre, clumsily-written story as “a rich and wonderfully-accomplished debut” made me wonder what sort of pressure exactly he had been under when he made it.

1128,No mystery here,PARVATHI NAYAR,2010-05-06,18:58:02 IST,"The Swan Thieves by Elizabeth Kostova
  Elizabeth Kostova’s retelling of the Dracula myth, The Historian (2005), was a runaway success, a doubly creditable feat considering it was her debut novel. Logical then that she has returned to the same idea of the historical thriller with a literary bent in her latest, The Swan Thieves. Here, she turns her talents to another myth that has captured public imagination since ancient times – that of the tortured genius artist.Cleverly, Kostova sets her mystery within the time period of an enduringly popular art “ism” – i.e., Impressionism. It’s not just the continuing beauty and craftsmanship of the works that make the Impressionists so fascinating, but also that the artists were rebels of their time, who dared to see and paint things differently, thereby challenging the popular idiom.
The Swan Thieves follows two story lines that unfold through multiple voices, letters and journals. In the past lies the tale of Beatrice de Clerval, an unsung Impressionist genius of 19th-century Paris. But de Clerval’s influence extends in a mysterious manner all the way to the present - and indirectly changes forever, the lives of many people including that of the book’s chief narrator, painter/psychiatrist Dr. Andrew Marlow.Dr. Marlow’s skill lies is inducing people to open up; we are told he has the ability to get “a stone to talk”. As a result, a strange new patient is admitted into his care, the talented artist Robert Oliver. Oliver is described as a traditionalist - “I actually don’t care about concepts very much,” he growls, preferring instead to draw traditional landscapes, portraits and still lives - but with such facility that even the unforgiving avant-garde art world of the present day cannot help but recognise his talent.Oliver gets into psychiatric treatment after apparently attacking a painting depicting Leda and the swan at the National Gallery with a knife. But after an initial conversation, Oliver doesn’t break his stony silence with Dr. Marlow – which apart from anything else, calls into serious question the doctor’s ability to engage rocks and boulders in meaningful conversation.At the psychiatric facility of Goldengrove in Rockville, Oliver mostly seems to engage in activity of the “pacing the room… clenching and unclenching his jaw” genre. He also draws and paints a mysterious woman over and over – and over – again. Though painted directly from his imagination with no model, these drawings were “alive, beyond alive” we are told in hushed prose. But since Oliver refuses to talk, his motives are a mystery to all concerned. Frankly, however, as we plough through over 500 pages of narrative of how Oliver has put several people through a lot of misery thanks to his self-absorbed ways as some sort of possessed genius, we stop caring too much about the tortured artist’s misery.Dr. Marlow himself is not the most appetising of protagonists and his eye for a pretty face is, well, a bit weird. Admittedly he is pursuing Oliver’s former loves – real and imaginary – in the name of detecting, uncovering the mystery and curing his patient. However he seems far more smitten by Oliver’s women than trying to help his patient. Kostova, actually, has a thing going with age in her book, what with nubile young women constantly falling for generationally older men throughout her narrative. Some of the women also give up on their art for reasons related to the men in their lives.Almost every major character in the book draws and paints – but each of their painterly visions come off sounding disconcertingly alike. It’s hard to tell the voices apart and as a result the characterisations aren’t distinct. At one level this makes the book a bit of a uniform and plodding read – at another, this homogenisation deeply undercuts the book’s belief in the artist as an individual who sees the world differently and expresses this vision in deeply distinctive ways.Kostova tries hard to evoke the mystery of creating art as she plots out the mystery in her novel, but the descriptions sound laboured. It is a subject many authors have attempted, but the truth of the matter is that writing about painting really isn’t an easy task – it is the same ambitious leap as trying to paint what’s written between the covers of a book.

1129,My name is Khan,ANVAR ALIKHAN,2010-05-06,18:55:39 IST,"Home Boy by H.M. Naqvi
  Someone e-mailed me this joke recently: In New York’s Central Park, a huge Rottweiler breaks loose from its leash and savages a small blonde child. A skinny young man rushes up and, at great risk to himself, saves the child by wrestling the dog to the ground and finally, in desperation, killing it.When it’s all over, the child’s mother comes up to the little bloodied man and thanks him profusely. It turns out she’s a famous journalist and she tells him she’s going to run a front page story about him in the New York Times headlined, “American hero saves child from vicious monster”. “But madam, I’m not American,” the little man replies. “Oh, what are you then?” asks the journalist. “I’m a Pakistani, madam”.So the next day’s New York Times carries a screaming headline, “Terrorist strangles pet dog”.No, it is not a great time to be a Pakistani. Your country is collapsing around you; your political system is one of the most rotten in the world; your society is fractured down the centre; the religious loonies are baying at the gates of your home. For many years Pakistanis who had the talent or the means usually chose to escape overseas, but in today’s world the ‘T’ word hangs threateningly over their heads wherever they go. And that is what Husain Naqvi’s Home Boy is all about.Boulevardiers and raconteursIt’s the story of three Pakistani 20-somethings living in Manhattan: Shehzad (“Chuck”), an investment banker; Jimbo, a hip-hop deejay; and AC, a dilettante and intellectual bum. They are “boulevardiers, raconteurs, renaissance men.” They hang around their favourite Tribeca bar-lounge, drinking vodka-on-the-rocks with a gaggle of socialites, arrivistes, metro-sexuals and wannabe models. They work; they play; they listen to Afro-jazz; they get in and out of trouble; they make pilgrimages to Jackson Heights to eat kabab-roti. But the theme that always seems to be playing in the background is the situation back home and “Hey-I-believe-Musharraf-is-making-an-important–speech-on-TV-today-don’t-miss-it.”After 9/11, however, the world is not the same for someone with a brown skin and a Muslim name. The three boulevardiers do something silly and the next thing they know is they’re blindfolded and squatting on the floor of a detention centre. Their homes are raided; a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook on the bookshelf is construed to be a bomb-making manual; Ibn Khaldun’s great philosophical classic Muqadimah is made out to be some kind of Islamic terror guide. And suddenly there’s an enormous FBI interrogator looming over them, saying “No phone call, no lawyer, no nothing. And if you’re lucky someday we’ll put you on a plane with a one-way ticket to Bumfuckistan. So let’s start again….” In today’s world, it’s something that could easily happen to you, or to me.
Stylish and eclectic
Naqvi writes with a stylishness and eclecticism that is so self-assured it’s almost arrogant: the fact that the book opens upon three selected quotes - the first from F. Scott Fitzgerald, the second from Urdu poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and the third from hip-hop artists, Eric B. & Rakim - is just an indication of the shape of things to come. But then Naqvi is a man who grew up in Algiers, graduated from Georgetown University, worked as an investment banker, has been a slam poet, and taught creative writing at Boston University. In fact he claims that Home Boy actually began as a slam poem, scribbled on a cocktail napkin in 1993, after his brother was routinely picked up by the cops for interrogation. And it’s that slam poet’s instinct that buzzes below the book’s sharp, sleek prose and its tightly wrought structure.
Home Boy was selected as one of the top 10 novels of the year by the Huffington Post, alongside Orhan Pamuk’s The Museum of Innocence and Ha Jin’s A Great Fall. So if I say it is one of the richest, most stylish novels I’ve read in a long time, I am in good company.

1130,High voltage drama,MITA GHOSE,2010-05-06,18:53:33 IST,"The Last Victory
  Exploring this novel is somewhat like opening a carefully preserved album of beautiful images and wondering if they’ll survive the harsh light of scrutiny. Any work of fiction that dares to toy with the historical past risks courting that danger. And the final days of the Raj, in particular — the subject of The Last Victory — has inspired so many memorable tomes that yet another novel, which gives it pride of place would, one imagines, invite more intense critical attention than most.But Timeri N. Murari’s grand Raj production (for that is how this sequel to The Imperial Agent comes across) will probably get away unscathed. Its meticulously researched historical backdrop notwithstanding, the book adroitly escapes being judged by the criteria that would apply to a historical novel. The thoroughness of this research is evident as the author weaves his suspense-charged fictional episodes around real-life events — among them, World War I and the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre — and smoothly incorporates personalities like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru into his narrative, making them come alive in imagined sequences, even if there is a tendency towards stereotyping in the delineation of such characters as General Reginald Dyer of Jallianwallah Bagh notoriety who vows to “teach the bloody wogs a lesson they’ll never forget”.Murari’s most inspired writing comes, however, from his portrait of another India, the one that happily accommodates demons and double agents, patriot-terrorists turned “
sanyasis” and brigands who rule the Chambal’s ravines, island palaces and temples to the snake god, hired assassins lurking in the shadows and zamindars who conspire from their thrones of ivory “the colour of fading sunlight”, evil spells and local superstitions and, of course, those rare and wondrous beings, Bala and Bala, blind twins with the power to transform people and places through their magical songs so that they are never again the same. In other words, oodles of exotica that lend the story the innocent charm of a fairy tale, while playing quite unabashedly on the old Western fixation — perpetuated partly by Hollywood — with the Orient’s supposedly unfathomable mystique.Appropriately enough, the hero is an “
Angrezi” born, but Indian “by love and thought”. Resurrected by the author from Kim, Rudyard Kipling’s creation, Kimball O’Hara is “a friend of the world”, brave, honourable and compassionate, with an embarrassing resemblance to the yesteryear Hollywood heroes some of us had massive crushes on long, long ago and now condescend to remember with a self-deprecating smile. It’s inevitable that Murari’s Kim, who takes up from where he had left off in The Imperial Agent, should be required in this novel to elude assassins, battle dacoits, fight superstition, exorcise demons and stand up to his former mentor, Colonel Creighton, who swears by Rule Britannia and would, if necessary, betray his own protégé to safeguard the interests of the Empire.It’s no surprise either that Kim’s love interest should be the beautiful Mohini/ Parvati, the original damsel in distress who can, when required, be bold enough to engage in anti-colonial activities, flee a brutal husband, love a man from another race (even if her romantic interludes with him are frustratingly chaste), bear him a child out of wedlock and ultimately carry out an act we wouldn’t have dreamed her capable of, so weepy and whisper-soft has her creator rendered her, the perfect prototype, it would seem, of the demure Oriental maiden with great hidden potential.Add Murari’s rich gallery of cameos and red-hot action sequences interspersed with lyrical passages and you have a potent, if quaint, cocktail of entertainment.It’s not difficult to understand why this author’s popularity has endured over the decades, despite changing literary tastes. Murari can remain secure in the knowledge that The Last Victory offers much, including some great celluloid moments that will lure us into a willing suspension of disbelief so that going with the flow follows naturally. Despite the faint whiff of mothballs, there’s much to be said, after all, for a reassuringly linear narrative, larger-than-life characters, a generous slice of realism, both magical and otherwise, high-voltage drama and an assured prose style that adapts itself easily to the demands of the context and is as invigorating as a breath of fresh air.

1131,Against the tyranny of facts,SUBASH JEYAN,2010-05-06,18:52:04 IST,"Lest we forget: Yann Martel. Photo: MACARENA YANEZ
  
Yann Martel's second novel has been a long time coming. Recently released in Canada and the US, 
Beatrice and Virgil
 has received polarised reviews. That it has been trashed as well as praised, he says, is a sign that it has elicited active engagement, not indifference, from the readers. The controversial reception is a sign that it is getting people to think and act, he says from San Francisco where he is on a promotional tour. Excerpts from a telephonic conversation...
Are you planning on coming to India to promote the book here?
I have a nine-month-old son. Before I can promote it — I am not going to Australia, New Zealand — I want to get back and be with my son. So, as much as I would love to return to India, for any reason, not just to promote my books, just to be in India — I haven't been there for about nine years now — I don't know when that'll be. India has changed a lot, I would love to go back and see that.
Is this novel about the primacy of the imagination? You think we live in a world where the profusion of facts is working against making sensible meaning out of it?
Reality is a 100 million details. Right now where you are, if you think about it, you are surrounded by 100 million details on which you could focus your attention. Everything, from chemical, scientific details to cultural details to personal emotional details... now some of that has to be lost. Time, you know, is an eraser. It all goes. [We need] something we can hold on to. It's called history. But even history has hundreds of thousands of details and sometimes it's overwhelming and it's hard to get to. The forte of the arts, the forte of the imagination is that it can take some of those details and give them immortality. A painting, a story, a song can float across the ocean of time like a lifeboat. So you can get to the essence of an event and convey it in the form of art. It can be like a suitcase, taking the essential and preparing you for a trip to elsewhere...
Does ‘getting to the essence' necessarily bring a moral perspective that is lacking in mere facts?
It can be but art isn't necessarily moral. Art could be immoral too. Art is witness. But in some stories, yes, it can also have a moral edge. It can also, in telling a story, convey certain moral situations. Which is what my novel does at the very end — In “Games for Gustav” are these 12 situations that are morally, existentially difficult. So, yes, it can make a moral situation fresh again...
You dwell at length in the initial stages of the novel about the concrete, everyday circumstances around writing /publishing that are usually glossed over. Is it autobiographical and are you saying that though there is a market built around imagination, it is essential to our being and identity?
I didn't do it because I wanted it to be autobiographical, it was more because of the idea of a writer who stops writing, whose message has stopped, suited me because I was discussing the Holocaust. And any great horrific event, the Holocaust, war, has a tendency to erase language, to make us at a loss for words. You know, famously, when people encountered the Accounts, their language was full of clichés to do with “there are no words to describe”, “I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing.” So, to have a writer who is at a loss for words and then to meet the taxidermist who is also in some ways at a loss for words suited my purpose when discussing the Holocaust...so that's why I have that theme.I did indeed have a meeting with my publishers, I did want to do a flip book with them but their argument was different. They were saying, “listen, an essay is a specialised product. A novel is not.” They were afraid the essay would drag down the novel.
You keep coming back to the notion that is art is about joy. The taxidermist is shown as someone who is joyless, cheerless, who plods through his play. “My story has no story. It is based on the fact of murder,” he says at one point. You think the character of the taxidermist is too steretypical, he and the novelist falling easily into opposite sides of a too-easy divide?
Art is joy in a general way. Any art, music, dance, painting, to create at that level is deeply joyful, it involves your whole being. Art and religion are the two ways in which we fully engage with life. In this particular case, I enjoyed wrestling with that subject. I wanted to make the taxidermist ambiguous. He clearly has some sort of a creative impulse, he is working on a play, he is quite rude with the writer. I wanted someone whom we wouldn't understand why he was doing the things he was doing until the very end and even then we are not sure what his intent was.And that to me was the parallel of the encounter of the Jews of Europe with the Nazis who did not see it coming. By the time they realised fully what the Nazis' intents were, it was too late, they couldn't escape and that's why so many died.
How has the novel been received?
It's been very interesting and very polarised. Some critics absolutely hated it. I got absolutely trashed by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and there's some blogger on the Internet named Edward Champion who absolutely hated it. And then you have reviewers who absolutely loved it. The USA Today thought it was positively a masterpiece. There were very positive reviews in Newsweek and the LA Times. So it's been very polarised, which is good. The one thing you don't want with art is indifference. You don't want people to shrug. Even when people hate it, they are engaging with it.
Is there some sort of thematic continuity or evolution between 
Life of Pi
 and 
Beatrice and Virgil

? If the former was about God, faith and religion, the latter is about imagination and art, isn't it?In some ways they are very different books. Yes, they both feature animals but that's just on the surface. In Life of Pi hopefully the reader loses himself looking at those animals. Forget may be his humanity. In Beatrice and Virgil those animals are anthropomorphised and are meant to bring us back to our humanity.And as for the role of the imagination, to me it's something more immediate like life itself is an interpretation. We cannot choose the reality we live in, but we can choose how we interpret it. In that sense, imagination is not something whimsical, fairy-tale like, I am simply saying that reality is a co-creation, reality is something which is out there but it is also how you take it. To that extent, I suppose there is a similarity between the two novels in the sense that how you represent reality will speak of how you see it, of what that reality is. A person of faith reads transcendendance into the world, sees a divine plan; I suppose it is the same with reading history. You are representing an event that is past, and in that representation there is an element of interpretation, of imaginative reading. In that way there is a thematic link between the two novels.
To me this novel seems to come behind a line of books from the West dealing with the Holocaust. Why this obsession in the West about the Holocaust? There are historical continuities to the Holocaust in the contemporary world like what is happening in Palestine, Gaza today, injustices, perhaps of equal magnitude. Nobody seems to talk about them much...
Well, aside of the politics of West Asia, which poisons everything, just looking in terms of history, the Holocaust still remains unique: every other genocide before and after has to some extent been politically expedient. The Armenians in Turkey were killed because they were in the way of the Turks who were trying to start their nation. Excesses in Gaza were committed because of political enmity between the Palestinians and the Israelis. In both cases you killed people who were in the way, who bothered you but the ones beyond a certain border were irrelevant to you. But the Nazis were obsessed with killing the Jews everywhere, as if they were a disease. That does remain unique. And the reason I think it is still relevant, not a piece of historical arcana from several years ago in the backwaters of Poland, is because what led to the Holocaust is still absolutely contemporary.The act of hate, the thinking of hatred, the disrespect in the mind of an individual that eventually in Germany led to the Holocaust, that little beginning, that seed of hatred is found everywhere. The Holocaust is not rooted in Auschwitz, in Poland. It is rooted in the human heart. And that applies to India too. There are people in India with holocaustal thinking, for example the BJP, the Shiv Sena, you know, that kind of hatred of the other whom you don't even know, who is just a construction in your mind to relieve tension, to relieve whatever... that is holocaustal. Now because India is democracy, there is a free press, it is unlikely that there will ever be a genocide but the roots are there...The thing about this novel is that it is not an orthodox Holocaust novel. There is no history in there, there are no Germans, there is minimal reference to the Holocaust yet it is soaked in it.So I do choose the Holocaust but not just as a historical artefact, I am looking at what is to me relevant. At the very end, there are 12 more situations where there is no historical colour or detail that put you at the heart of it. And those 12 situations could take place in India. You could be in a line of people about to be executed and you could be holding your grand daughter's hand and she asks you a question. And what might that question be? What would a child be thinking when it sees people being massacred? That completely fits in with realities in India today. That's why I think it's still relevant...
Exclusive excerpts from Yann Martel's 
Beatrice and Virgil

…
(Virgil and Beatrice are sitting at the foot of the tree. They are looking out blankly. Silence
.)
Virgil: What I'd give for a pear.

Beatrice: A pear?

Virgil: Yes. A ripe and juicy one.

Beatrice: I've never had a pear.

Virgil: What?

Beatrice: In fact, I don't think I've ever set eyes on one.

Virgil: How is that possible? It's a common fruit.

Beatrice: My parents were always eating apples and carrots. I guess they didn't like pears.

Virgil: But pears are so good! I bet you there's a pear tree right around here. (He looks about.)

Beatrice: Describe a pear for me. What is a pear like?

Virgil: (settling back) I can try. Let's see . . . To start with, a pear has an unusual shape. It's round and fat on the bottom, but tapered on top.

Beatrice: Like a gourd.

Virgil: A gourd
? You know gourds but you don't know pears? How odd the things we know and don't. At any rate, no, a pear is smaller than an average gourd, and its shape is more pleasing to the eye. A pear becomes tapered in a symmetrical way, its upper half sitting straight and centred atop its lower half. Can you see what I mean?
Beatrice: I think so.

Virgil: Let's start with the bottom half. Can you imagine a fruit that is round and fat?

Beatrice: Like an apple?

Virgil: Not quite. If you look at an apple with your mind's eye, you will notice that the girth of the apple is at its widest either in the middle of the fruit or in the top third, isn't that so?

Beatrice: You're right. A pear is not like this?

Virgil: No. You must imagine an apple that is at its widest in the bottom third.

Beatrice: I can see it.

Virgil: But we must not push the comparison too far. The bottom of a pear is not like an apple's.

Beatrice: No?

Virgil: No. Most apples sit on their buttocks, so to speak, on a circular ridge or on four or five points that keep them from falling over. Past the buttocks, a little ways up, there's what would be the anus of the fruit if the fruit were a beast.

Beatrice: I see precisely what you mean.

Virgil: Well, a pear is not like that. A pear has no buttocks. Its bottom is round.

Beatrice: So how does it stay up?

Virgil: It doesn't. A pear either dangles from a tree or lies on its side.

Beatrice: As clumsy as an egg.

Virgil: There's something else about the bottom of a pear: most pears do not have those vertical grooves that some apples have. Most pears have smooth, round, even bottoms.

Beatrice: How enchanting.

Virgil: It certainly is. Now let us move north past our fruity equator.

Beatrice: I'm following you.

Virgil: There comes this tapering I was telling you about.

Beatrice: I can't quite see it. Does the fruit come to a point? Is it shaped like a cone?

Virgil: No. Imagine the tip of a banana.

Beatrice: Which tip?

Virgil: The end tip, the one you hold in your hand when you're eating one.

Beatrice: What kind of banana? There are hundreds of varieties.

Virgil: Are there?

Beatrice: Yes. Some are as small as fat fingers, others are real clubs. And their shapes vary too, as do their taste.

Virgil: I mean the regular, yellow ones that taste really good.

Beatrice: The common banana, M. sapientum
. You probably have the Gros Michel variety in mind.
Virgil: I'm impressed.

Beatrice: I know bananas.

Virgil: Better than a monkey. Take the end tip of a common banana, then, and place it on top of an apple, taking into account the differences between apples and pears that I've just described.

Beatrice: An interesting graft.

Virgil: Now make the lines smoother, gentler. Let the banana flare out in a friendly way as it merges into the apple. Can you see it?

Beatrice: I believe I can.

Virgil: One last detail. At the very top of this apple-banana composite, add a surprisingly tough stalk, a real tree trunk of a stalk. There, you have an approximation of a pear.

Beatrice: A pear sounds like a beautiful fruit.

Virgil: It is. In colour, commonly, a pear is yellow with black spots.

Beatrice: Like a banana again.

1132,Questions of identity,JAI ARJUN SINGH,2010-05-06,18:49:20 IST,"Aatish Taseer's The Temple-goers
  The narrator of Aatish Taseer’s debut novel is a young man named Aatish Taseer, and some of the details of his life appear drawn from the author’s. The device is guaranteed to raise questions about exactly how “autobiographical” The Temple-goers is (as if such things are neatly quantifiable), but that would be to miss the wood for the trees; this is a book that encourages us to ask subtler – and more interesting – questions about identity.The fictional Aatish is a young writer born to privilege. After a few years studying and working in America and England he’s just returned to Delhi to revise a novel, and he has access to two apartments – his mother’s and his girlfriend Sanyogita’s – in the high-end colonies that border Lutyen’s Delhi. A citizen of the world, Aatish is estranged from non-cosmopolitan India, and always conscious of – and uneasy about – this estrangement.This is reflected early on, in the book’s descriptions. When he writes about places like Jorbagh and Lodhi Gardens, he does it with precision and familiarity. But he’s on less firm ground with other parts of Delhi, including its growing satellite towns, and the novel is deliberately non-specific about those parts. Instead of Noida or Ghaziabad, they are given the abstract names “Sectorpur” and “Phasenagar”. The impression one gets is of a city map where the posh colonies of south-central Delhi are in sharp relief but the names get blurred as the map spreads outwards, until the satellite towns are anonymous smudges: unknowable and frightening places to someone who has led a sheltered life.We are prepared, then, for the fascination Aatish feels towards the book’s other major figure, a fitness trainer named Aakash who lives in a lower-income-group flat in Sectorpur. “Double A like me!” Aakash exclaims when he learns Aatish’s name, the first time they meet, but gradually we will come to see how Aakash himself is something of a double, a doppelganger for our narrator. He’s a developed character in his own right, but it’s also possible to see him as a figure born in Aatish’s subconscious, threatening and attractive in equal measure. As a high-caste Brahmin, seemingly very sure of his place in the world, he is an object of envy, and Aatish’s descriptions of him have a ring of awe (“His small, powerful body hovered over mine, the rope of black religious strings hanging down like a noose…”). When he shows up – as a security guard – at an upper-crust Holi party where Aatish is a guest, and later, when he invites himself to Aatish’s flat, there is a hint of rupture, of one world intruding on another.Their improbable friendship deepens: Aatish goes on a day trip with Aakash and his family to an ancestral village temple; later, he accompanies him to the home of a middle-aged prostitute where they share a different sort of intimacy. Aatish’s interest in his new friend’s life may suggest a novelist collecting material for his next book, but it’s just as likely that he is trying to understand himself and the country he wants badly to belong to.
The Temple-goers is a carefully crafted book in which even seemingly marginal scenes (such as a description of a writers’ meet where a young man reads out a short story that may or may not be an account of a real-life incident) become significant in retrospect. This carefulness can also be seen in its examination of identity – national, communal and personal.In his first book Stranger to History, Taseer – whose estranged father is a Pakistani Muslim – described his journeys through various Islamic countries to try and understand how the religion manifests itself in different places. The Temple-goers is, in part, a complementary examination of Hinduism, a religion that had pagan roots and was not founded on a fixed belief system; the repercussions – good and bad – of this fluidity; and the growing danger of it being overtaken by fundamentalist forces today.At one point, Aatish’s Urdu teacher Zafar uses the word “
vehshat” to describe India’s “history of animalism and sacrifice”, which he associates with the majority religion. “The land is stained,” he says, “It has seen terrible things: girl children sacrificed, widows burned, the worship of idols.” We are reminded of his words in a later passage set during a jagran, where the master of ceremonies cheerfully tells a story involving the sacrifice of a young boy – and still later, when a gruesome murder takes place in Sectorpur.But it’s equally clear that this is just one perspective, and The Temple-goers offers us others. In one very entertaining passage, ideas of India are bandied about at a dinner party where a V.S. Naipaul-like figure – a writer named Vijaipal – holds centre-stage. Responding to the popular liberal-intellectual stand that India isn’t really a single country at all – that the common man from Gujarat, Assam or Tamil Nadu wouldn’t have the faintest idea of India as a land – this writer declaims that the temple-going Indian “knows this country backwards. He forever carries an idea of it in his head…He knows it through its holy places…there is almost no other country, certainly not one so vast, where the countrymen are as acquainted with the distant reaches of the land through their pilgrimages as they are in India”.Persuasive though this monologue is, the reader might well wonder whether this generic “temple-goer” really is a pan-Indian creature or if what we’re talking about here is again a very specific variety of north Indian religious chauvinism. But then, one of this book’s achievements is that it presents forceful ideas without necessarily throwing in its lot with any of them. The fictional Aatish may have a clear sense of what the future will hold for Indians like him – and for Indians like Aakash – but the real Taseer doesn't give us a broad, over-simplified view of a vast, contradiction-ridden country.

  The creation of Israel, for Jews, was the fulfilment of 3000 years of yearnings for a Jewish homeland. For Palestinians, it was El Nakba, the catastrophe, which rendered them homeless and forced them, to live in perpetual misery. The Jewish version of the Israel-Palestine story has found a place in English fiction umpteen times; the most popular being Exodus by Leon Uris, a book that generated a huge wave of sympathy in the U.S. for the state of Israel. But there was no novel of mass appeal originally written in English, on this issue from the Palestinian perspective until Susan Abulhawa decided to write one. 
The catastrophe Mornings in Jenin opens in 1941 and centres on a Palestinian family, the Abulhejas, a happy farming family in a picturesque and serene village named Ein Hod near Haifa. But their happiness comes to an abrupt end with the birth of Israel seven years later, as they are forcibly evicted from the land of their forefathers and made to live in a refugee camp in Jenin.  In Jenin, Amal Abulheja, the chief protagonist, is born. With her, we embark on a journey through the tumultuous history of post-1948 Palestine. In between, we also witness the personal losses Amal suffers: her father goes away never to return, her mother becomes insane, her husband is killed in a bombing, her sister-in-law and niece are slaughtered during a massacre and much more. When the journey ends after 325 pages, we are left wondering: How can someone be so brutal to his fellow human beings? How can the victims of a Holocaust metamorphose overnight into the instigators of a catastrophe? How do some people not lose their humanity even in times of extreme adversity? Of course, the book is a work of fiction but the events, from the forceful dispossession of Palestinians in 1948 to the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982, are facts, and many real people inhabit this story of heartbreak, exile, and human tragedy.
Poetic prose
What struck me most is the honesty of the author’s voice. Despite being born to Palestinian refugees of the Six Day War of 1967, she has tried hard not to let her personal feelings fill the text. All individual Jewish characters are portrayed in sympathetic light. Nowhere in the story has she lost the touch of humanity. Another bright aspect of Susan’s writing is her ornamental use of language in the tradition of contemporary Arabic writing. For instance, here is a taste of the opening paragraph from the chapter, ‘‘The Harvest’’: In a distant time, before history marched over the hills and shattered present and future, before wind grabbed the land at one corner and shook it of its name and character, before Amal was born, a small village east of Haifa lived quietly on figs and olives, open frontiers and sunshine. In the nutshell, it is a remarkable novel, which will help us to understand the Israel-Palestine conflict better.

“Suddenly there came through the open window the sound of sweet music. Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust. And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, “Go on, little nightingale, go on.”
The nightingale in Hans Christian Andersen's tale is iconic of the life-spirit story-telling has always been.Andersen also foresaw through the tale the fate of genuine art, thought and expression. Earlier in the story, a toy nightingale which always sings the same song in the same vein gets an overwhelming approval rating from his crafty courtiers and his people. The problem: None of them had heard a real nightingale!It is like the fate of classic writings and great literature today. The massive difference in the situation from just a couple of decades ago is striking. To see the real collapse however you will have to peep a little into the vernacular world of contemporary Telugu publishing and reading, and ratings!Why do the classics matter at all? Gandhi Annapaneni realised the difference they make to society during his two years stay as an international student in the erstwhile Soviet Russia. The lack of translations of classic writings especially from the sciences and social sciences in local languages throughout Africa and Asia was a glaring contrast from the situation in Europe. “Accessing and understanding the great ideas and concepts through your own language matters a lot in creating a sturdy intellectual foundation and building up native confidence,” says Gandhi. Considerable good work was done in the decades preceding and following independence in many languages in India but it was primarily focused on bringing in literary works. Even that has become a trickle now.Remarkably, Gandhi's cherished project took shape and evolved amidst such exceedingly adverse climate. By that time sales of ‘serious' Telugu books had plummeted dramatically. Telugu publishing houses had to survive, as they still do, on a hot-mix of vaastu, astrology, religion, personality development and books for competitive exams.The range and variety of the 58 well-translated and attractively produced books in Telugu which Gandhi has brought out in the last five years under the Peacock Classics label, aided of course by a small band of friends and well-wishers, comes as an exceedingly pleasant delight. It is a fine mix of philosophy, science, constitutional law, mythology, folk tales, children's literature and literary classics — ancient, medieval, modern, Indian and foreign. Finding suitable translators who could bring out the essentials of the original in lucid and contemporary Telugu was the most difficult task Gandhi had to face. His persistence shows in the results.Sales figures, though un-encouraging, have not disappointed Gandhi too much. Kaalam Katha, a translation of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time for instance has had seven editions (each 1000 copies). About ten titles including Amma (Maxim Gorky) have done modestly well. The books are priced reasonably. “Yet, most of the target audience for these books, especially in the student community either do not have the resources or are unwilling to spend on books”, feels Gandhi.“The public library system in Andhra Pradesh is no more what it used to be yet there are still 1500 functional libraries spread over the state. So we are inviting people who feel passionately about Telugu and good books in Telugu to pick any work choose any title of their choice from a list of 40 books. The books will be reprinted (with the donor's name) and the copies donated directly to the public libraries,” reveals Gandhi.",https://www.thehindu.com/books/Connecting-to-the-classics/article16298720.ece

  My Name is Gauhar Jaan!- The Life and times of a musician, the biography of the first Indian who recorded her voice, was released by Governor of Andhra Pradesh E.S.L. Narasimhan in Chennai on Wednesday.“Reading the book left me with a strange mix of sadness and happiness,” said the Governor.“When Gauhar Jaan excels, you feel happy and when she goes through pangs of separation, pangs of deprivation you feel sad,” he said, adding that the author's in-depth research into various aspects and places is in fact mind boggling, given the constraints of availability of time/material and far flung places.The Governor said “books like these bring back history to the modern generation and provide you a sense of pride in your rich heritage and culture and does leave an impact on the reader.”N. Murali, Senior Managing Director, Kasturi & Sons Ltd, said the book was in line with the current trend of documenting the life of great musicians, while earlier it was considered that art was higher than the artists.“Gauhar Jaan used technology to liberate herself from the exploitation in the hands of patrons of arts. She really democratised music and she was ahead of her time,” he said, recalling how male musicians of earlier days refused to record their voice fearing that doing so would affect their voice.Author of the book Vikram Sampath said Gauhar Jaan visited Chennai in 1910 and her concert in Victoria Hall was a great success. Enthralled by her music, Veena Dhanammal hosted a dinner and she even taught her a Thyagaraja Keertha in suruti raag. Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar learnt a few bhajans from her. She cut close to 600 records. V.

  | Photo Credit: Judi Bottoni In a rare coincidence, researchers working in both Turkey and Iran discovered on the same day how a rare species of bee builds its nest with petals of pink, yellow, blue and purple flowers.The females from the solitary species Osima (Ozbekosima) avoseta line the nest's brood chambers with petals that provide nutrients for the larvae to grow and mature and protect the next generation as they wait out the winter.“It was absolute synchronicity that we all discovered this uncommon behaviour on the same day,” says Jerome Rozen, curator in the division of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History.“In this species, a female shingles the wall of her brood chambers with large pieces of petals or with whole petals, often of many hues,” says Mr. Rozen.“Unfortunately, her larvae never enjoy the brilliant colours of the nest's walls because they have no eyes - and, anyhow, they would need a flashlight!” he said.Mr. Rozen and colleagues were working near Antalya, Turkey while another group of researchers were in the field in Fars Province, Iran.“I'm very proud of the fact that so many authors contributed to this paper,” Mr. Rozen said.Bees are the most important animal pollinators living today and many flowering plants depend on them to reproduce.But nearly 75 percent of bee species - there are about 20,000 species described - are solitary.This means that for the majority of bees, a female constructs a nest for herself and provisions each chamber in the nest with food for the larval stage of her brood.When each chamber is ready, the female deposits an egg and closes the nest if there is only one chamber to a nest, says a release of the American Museum of Natural History.The nests - found in the open - need to be protected from any number of potential threats to their physical structure like compaction of the soil, desiccation, or excessive heating.The survival of solitary bee species also depends on protection from moulds, viruses, bacteria, parasites, and predators.The research was published in American Museum Novitates.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Bee-species-that-builds-its-nest-with-petals/article16298780.ece

During 12 years of follow-up, 125 husbands and 70 wives developed dementia, and both the husband and wife developed dementia in 30 couples.After adjusting for a number of factors, the researchers found that people with a spouse who developed dementia were six times more likely to develop dementia themselves than people whose spouses never had dementia. Men had a higher risk than women. Older age was also significantly associated with dementia risk.“Future studies are needed to determine how much of this association is due to caregiver stress compared to a shared environment,” said study leader Dr. Maria Norton at the university.“On the positive side, the majority of individuals with spouses who develop dementia did not themselves develop dementia, therefore more research is needed to explore which factors distinguish those who are more vulnerable.”“Given the significant public health concern of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and the upcoming shift in population age composition, continued research into the causes of dementia is urgent,” Dr. Norton said.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Alzheimers-may-be-ldquoinfectiousrdquo-among-spouses-study/article16298779.ece

  | Photo Credit: Mikhail Metzel Mammoths had more than woolly coats to protect them from the frigid conditions of their sub-zero stomping grounds, scientists have discovered.The extinct beasts had a form of antifreeze blood that kept their bodies supplied with oxygen in the sub-zero temperatures, according to a study of DNA extracted from 43,000-year-old mammoth remains.A genetic adaptation in the woolly mammoths' haemoglobin - the molecular cage that carries oxygen in the blood - allowed them to thrive at high latitudes without losing much heat.Ancestors of the woolly mammoth originated in equatorial Africa about seven million years ago, but populations migrated north more than one million years ago, in a period of Earth's history when climate change caused temperatures to plummet.Unlike modern elephants, which have evolved large ears and other characteristics to keep cool in excessive heat, ancestral mammoths survived by evolving ways of saving heat, such as small ears and tails.In the latest study, a team led by Kevin Campbell at the University of Manitoba in Canada found another physiological trick that mammoths used to endure the ice age. Campbell's team isolated haemoglobin DNA from a woolly mammoth recovered from the Siberian permafrost and compared it with genetic code extracted from modern African and Asian elephants.The mammoth's DNA differed in a small but significant way. Changes in one percent of the proteins studied showed that it took less energy for mammoth haemoglobin to release its oxygen into the body as it coursed through the blood vessels. “It literally allows their blood to run cold,” Mr. Campbell said.“Without this genetic adaptation, woolly mammoths would lose more heat in winter, and they would have to replace that energy by eating more. In winter, there is less food around, so it was clearly a benefit to have this.” The research is reported in the journal Nature Genetics.Current Arctic species, such as musk ox and reindeer, have evolved a similar antifreeze system independently.Mr. Campbell said the work shows how paleobiology - broadly the study of ancient, extinct life - has come of age. “We resurrected mammoth haemoglobin. It's no different from going back 40,000 years in a time machine and taking a blood sample from the animal.”Michi Hofreiter, a co-author of the study at the University of York, said: “Our study is the first one to reconstruct an evolutionary important, adaptive trait from an extinct species using ancient DNA. It therefore opens up the possibility to build up a much more complete picture of morphology, physiology and evolutionary adaptations than would be possible using non-molecular study of fossil bones.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/Mammothsrsquo-survival-trick-ndash-anti-freeze-blood/article16298778.ece
1140,Scientists find way to boost nutritional levels of corn,IANS,2010-05-06,18:01:40 IST,"An ear of corn. Photo: AP
  | Photo Credit: Matt Rourke An international team of agricultural scientists has found a way to boost the nutritional value of corn and prevent blindness among children.In Africa and other developing regions, corn is a major staple and hundreds of thousands of children become blind, develop weakened immune systems and die because of diets based largely on corn that lacks sufficient beta-carotene.Corn contains carotenoids, some of which the body can convert to Vitamin A. Beta-carotene is the best Vitamin A precursor, but only a very small percentage of corn varieties have naturally high beta-carotene levels.Marilyn Warburton and Edward Buckler, geneticists with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and colleagues identified genetic sequences linked to higher beta-carotene levels in corn, showing a cheaper and faster way to identify corn plants that will produce even higher levels.The researchers surveyed the genetic sequences of corn from around the world through association mapping, a method made possible by recent breakthroughs that accelerate the genetic profiling of crops.The genetic survey revealed natural variations in one gene sequence linked to higher beta-carotene levels, said an ARS release.These variations interacted with a gene identified previously, and the best variations of the two genes together led to an 18-fold increase in beta-carotene, according to Warburton.The report was recently published in Nature Genetics.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/Scientists-find-way-to-boost-nutritional-levels-of-corn/article16298786.ece

  | Photo Credit: Mail Driven by the multifaceted and intricate human emotions, Mohanmurli Talak is an abstract painter who has been arduously trying to capture the human emotion on the canvas.“Crises of human mind” has remained a pivotal subject in his paintings. The extensive use of light colours which is palpable in his works, Talak has carved a distinct niche for himself in the domain of abstract painting.Being a native of Chitradurga, the 52-year-old self-made painter has largely remained as an unsung artist for the people of his native district.Having exhibited his works in the prestigious art galleries including Y. B. Chavan Art Gallery, Mumbai, Lakshana Art Gallery, Chennai, and Chitrakala Parishat Bangalore, Talak has never undergone any formal course in visual art. It was his immense passion for painting that made him learn the intricacies of abstract painting.Talak uses simple, but varied textures to create his work. He meticulously makes efforts to ensure that his work has a soothing effect on the viewers. “Many people don't even understand the concept of abstract art, however my prime objective is to make people at least change their mood by glancing at my work,” he says.Profoundly inspired by the paintings of the classical painter Raja Ravi Varma who lived between 1848 and 1906, Talak emphatically believes that a painter can contribute towards social change.In the field of art for over 15 years, Talak says that he never had an idea that one day he would become a professional artist. Working as an accountant in a private firm in Chitradurga, he says that the biggest challenge for him was to quit his job to take up painting as a fulltime career.“It was not easy task to convince my wife of quitting a well-paid job, especially when I had an additional responsibility of a young son. Yet, I had a strong conviction for art that made me to go against all odds to prove myself,” he said.“I try to make that has an intimate feel, but also not look vulgar. You can portray nudity without being cheap,” he explains, about an entire series that he has done for one's private space.Talak, who has also created innumerable pen-drawings of historical monuments of Chitradurga, says that a painter through his works could help the place become popular among the tourists.Veerendra Heggade, the chief of Dharmasthala temple is also someone who appreciates his work. According to Talak, several of his works have made place in the Heggade's institutions.Talak feels that the painting exhibitions are gradually shifting their domain from galleries to internet.

1142,Evolution of modern art,CHARUKESI,2010-05-06,17:38:15 IST,"Family on scooter: Sculpture at Cholamandal village
  Produced for the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysore, the two-part documentary ‘Modern Art in Tamilnadu' runs for about less than an hour. Yet it appears to have covered most of the vital aspects of the history of Tamil Nadu's art scene from early 1850. The documentary has been directed by Amshan Kumar, writer on films, whose book ‘Cinema Rasanai' is considered a pioneering work in film aesthetics in Tamil.The first part goes back to the genesis of modern art and covers its growth up to the 1960s. The then British rulers established the Government School of Industrial Arts in Madras in 1850 with a view to inculcating Victorian taste among art students. However, it was only in 1929 that modern art took firm roots in Tamil Nadu, when Devi Prasad Roychoudury became the Principal of the School.The statues of Mahatma Gandhi and the Triumph of Labour on Marina, sculpted by him stand testimony to Roychoudury's vision. He was mainly instrumental in inspiring a whole (young) generation interested in modern art and was responsible for establishing ‘Madras School' in the world of art.“There is an interesting story,” says Amshan Kumar. “Once when D.P. Roychoudhury was painting, the coffee he was sipping spilled on it. Students watching him thought that he would discard it. No, he ordered for more cups of coffee and poured all over the canvas and made it one of even tone. This shows his creativity!”It was then the period of K.C.S. Panicker, who took up the mantle of projecting modern art in Tamil Nadu. From water colour he switched on to oil painting. He was the one who laid great emphasis on the Indianness of our art. He founded the Cholamandal Artists' Village.Another institution that nurtured the artistic talents of students came up in Kumbakonam. The town, surrounded by mighty temples, provided ample scope to hone the artistic skills of students on the traditional lines. It was christened the Kumbakonam College of Arts & Crafts in 1962. According to Amshan Kumar, eminent artists such as S. Dhanapal, A.P. Santhana Raj, R. Krishna Rao, R.B. Bhaskaran, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and Alphonso Aruldoss served in both Chennai and Kumbakonam. Works of C.J. Anthony Doss, L. Munusamy, Krishna Rao, P.V. Janakiraman, Ramanujan and a few others are discussed.The second part covers the movement from 1970s till now. It carries the brief interviews of R.B. Bhaskaran, Alphonso Arul Doss, Achuthan Koodallur, K. Muralidharan, Vidyashankar Sthapathi and so on. Adimoolam's transition from black and white line drawings of Gandhiji to abstract oil paintings was as courageous as it was fascinating.
Figure distortion
Famed artist and art director P. Krishnamurthy's opinion that figure distortion, which arrived from the West after experimentation, was indeed introduced by the Indian artists very early on. Artists from the younger generation such as Aparajithan, Shilesh and Srinivasan also find a place with their works.While the English script for the documentary has been done by Lakshmi Venkatraman, the Tamil version has been handled by Amshan Kumar himself. A. Sarangan has wielded the camera and the voice over has been provided by Selvakumar.
Since the venue of the screening was the College premises, majority of the audience was students. Amshan Kumar answered questions posed by them.

Why the documentary chooses to be illustrative and not exhaustive in showing the artists?
“Being the first documentary that chronicles the entire history of modern art in Tamil Nadu, a limited time frame has its own charms and perils. I am not partial towards a few and biased against some of the artists. Duration of time decided the number of artists. Artists featured in this documentary are important, but those who do not are no less important. Inclusion of 50-plus major artists would have made the film like a catalogue and have done justice to none. My aim is more such films should be made and they should bring in artists who are not featured here.
Why did he make this documentary?
My aim is to demystify modern art since in the public mind it is thought of as abstruse and arcane. I think the film has achieved the objective, since many artists have explained their work in great detail and also worked in front of the camera. Viewers will feel that they are in the privacy of the studios of artists, watching as they work. I am grateful to all of them and the Central Institute of Indian Languages, as this documentary is first of its kind.Amshan Kumar has produced around twenty documentaries. They include ‘Bharathi,’ ‘U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer,’ ‘Dr. C.V. Raman,’ ‘Ashokamitran,’ ‘Badal Sircar’s Third Theatre,’ ‘Mangroves,’ ‘Tamil Theatre,’ and ‘Village Knowledge Centres’ among others. He made a feature film ‘Oruthi’ based on Ki. Rajanarayanan’s story ‘Kidai’ This was shown in Indian panorama and won an award, too.

1143,The salt stories,RANA SIDDIQUI ZAMAN,2010-05-06,17:08:15 IST,"V. Karthik and Sujatha Shankar Prasad
  While a few students are seen lost in their studies in the silent library room of the American Centre, it's off colour walls with a few aqua blue and mostly black and white photographs attract attention with a silence of another kind — the silence which a city-bred commoner probably didn't even care to listen to. Sometimes a picture doesn't need words to explain its content, but in the case of these photographs, words lend them a fairytale air, turning them into legends. It also draws attention to the most utilised, yet the most ignored ingredient in a household — salt.Two photographers, Chicago-based Sujatha Shankar Prasad and Chennai-based V. Karthik, chose to tell the tale of salt making from the mines at Marakkanam on the outskirts of Puducherry. Photographs detailing the process of natural salt making in the sun, as well as those of Chicago River reflecting images of the Chicago skyscrapers form this exhibition titled “Barking Tree and other places: Mythologies in the Landscape” at The American Centre.Says Karthik, “The salt mines at Puducherry play a very symbolic role for me — of free human spirit and Mahatma Gandhi. If you see these vast seascapes in summers, you will not find any human activity there. From morning to evening, salt gathers at the shores and the sun crystallises it, forming numerous, shining, uniform mounds. Landscape is hardly visible as salt forms the backwaters of the sea. Human activity happens much later when a huge mountain of salt gets naturally prepared and people from villages come to collect it. This is their only source of sustenance. And in my lab, every day I work with this water, light, shade and brightness. I could relate to the natural process.”
Interesting shots
Both Sujatha and Karthik took several interesting shots of the salt making process and the former has woven them into heart-warming tales. For instance, in a picture, an alert dog is seen sitting near a mountain of salt, almost guarding it, and a tree in the shape of a dog is called barking tree. A third picture shows a woman with a basket of salt heading homewards. Sujatha weaves them with a beautiful story that touches your heart.The prints are achieved using a traditional method no longer utilised. “Marakkanam are primarily black and white prints on fibre using traditional photographic methods from 35mm T max negative film. Tonal processes have also been explored in the colour prints for the Chicago River series, which were originally shot on Ilford XP2, a monochromatic film with a chromomeric base,” says Karthik.Says Sujatha, “In 1995 I took shots of the Chicago River on 35 mm and kept their negatives for ages. But as I wanted to take pictures out of them, they had lost quality. That's what brought me to V. Karthik in Chennai, who works in conservation and traditional photography.”The show continues till May 21.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/The-salt-stories/article16298769.ece

  That artists should not imitate is Shilpi Rajan's motto. Therefore following a set of prescribed rules is, naturally, quite unthinkable for the renowned artist.“I never repeat my works,” quipped Rajan as he pointed out his sculptures, which were on display at the Kerala Lalitakala Akademi in Thrissur from April 28 to May 4. And true to his word, each of the 64 sculptures on show at the exhibition titled ‘Kalkkathal,' was unique. This was Rajan's 11th solo exhibition since he started sculpting back in 1984.
Self-taught artiste
The self-taught sculptor revels at depicting varying moods in the same sculpture. “Perhaps it is because I do not complete a sculpture at a stretch.“Although gloom would appear to be the dominant mood,the sculptures actually reflect my mood at that particular point of time when I worked on them,” explained Rajan.“As in life, a sculpture too cannot bear a permanent mood,” he added.What strikes one the most is the influence of folk culture in the sculptures. His human figurines bear clear traces of folk and tribal deities found in the State.Perhaps it is because the artist cannot escape the social milieu in which he grew up. As such, Rajan leaves behind a touch of his identity and originality even in his commissioned works.A wooden sculpture depicting Parvati and Ganapati and one of Koodiyattam maestro Chahchu Chakyar in granite are examples.Of the sculptures that were exhibited, 13 were in granite and four in laterite. None of them has been given a name. “The meaning of a sculpture cannot be contained in a name. It is for the viewer to interpret the meanings for themselves,” said the artist. There is one work though that is special to him, he said.It is a long wooden piece that depicts elephants huddled together, each standing on another and with a woman at the top. The message conveyed is that elephants are so gentle that they can be managed even by one woman.“It also signifies the inter-relationship between animals and nature,” he said.An eye that is not shaped well or a lip that is not in place does not seem to faze the artist and he appears not to be unduly worried about sticking to the norms of sculpting. Studying the sculptures of others, he said, was not of any value to him.“I feel that sculpture should not be taught. Rather, it should be developed in the course of one's own practice of the art,” said Rajan.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/In-myriad-moods/article16298757.ece

Growth is the be-all and end-all for all economies around the world, and if you're not growing economically, you're stagnant, and therefore that's a bad thing and governments get sacked. So we have a system built around increasing our consumption rates, and that's unsustainable in the long term.”The study, however, did not include human health and economic data, instead focusing exclusively on environmental indicators.Mr. Bradshaw said while Australia had few forests to start with, land clearing had removed more than half of them since European settlement.Released in the United Nations’ International Year of Biodiversity, the study also indicates that Australia has the highest mammalian extinction rate in the world, largely due to introduced species such as foxes, cats and rats, and habitat loss.“And we are one of the highest per capita water users and carbon emitters in the world,” Mr. Bradshaw was quoted as saying.The study, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Princeton University, also presented a separate ranking using a proportional environmental impact index, which measured impact against resource availability.On that scale, the 10 worst countries were Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Netherlands.Mr. Bradshaw said the better-ranked countries were small places such as Cape Verde, Swaziland, Niger and Grenada.“They haven't wiped out all their forests but they live well below what we'd consider poverty,” he said adding, “We have things to learn from these countries in terms of consumption and in reducing our consumption”.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/India-among-the-worst-10-polluters-Study/article16298793.ece

  | Photo Credit: K_Murali Kumar Dance festival Nitya Nritya commenced with Lalitha Srinivasan's “Nritya Karnataka”, the opulence of which is marked with its supreme musical score sung by Srivatsa, with the dance choreography accomplished brilliantly by students of Nupura School of Dance.Commencing the evening with “astanayika” with verse in Kannada, set to ragamalika and talamalika, the group proved their forte implementing the composition set by their Guru intensely.Segregating the astanayikas equally amongst well-groomed dancers, while a single dancer enacted the sanchari with the rest freezing at a particular posture concomitant to the sthayi bhava of the nayika implementation, the choreographer, brilliantly composed each Nayika giving a ingenious touch. With awesome prototypes governing the proscenium, the dancers moved onto a Manasi Varnam penned and choreographed by Lalitha Srinivasan pivoting around the pranks of Lord Krishna, the Geetopodesham episode with a musical composition by the late H.K. Narayana.Ajay Vishwanath, one of the seniormost students executed his metaphor brilliantly in the said piece. “Nritya Karnataka” concluded with a ragamalika tillana set to aditala aesthetically performed by the dancers executing square, circle to form the Sri Chakra concept.The Sufiana Kathak under the leadership of Rani Khanam from New Delhi followed next. With the dancer seemingly self-conscious, she tried hard to do justice to the items that she performed. The tihayis, the anahat and the concluding “Mohae apnae rang de rangilae” composed by Hazrat Amir Khusru in the 13th Century deserves special mention for their accomplishment in high aesthetic order. Bharat Natyam thematic duet by P. Praveen Kumar and Soundarya Srivatsa was brilliant. With the kritis, the javalis and the ashtapadis being intertwined into a thematic production “Shringara Lahiri” set to ragamalika and talamalika sung aesthetically by Srivatsa was a real treat to watch. Both the dancers proved their mettle in this evocative rendition.The plot complimented with Soundarya being mesmerised with the flute of Lord Krishna and Praveen in the limelight executing the advent of the Lord with an awesome amalgamation of jathis; it was executed flawlessly. With a peacock's feather as an imagery, Praveen with Soundarya as Radha complimented each other brilliantly on the stage. The “Radhae Brindavana Nilayae” set to raga Rithigowla was an outstanding performance. Abhinaya reaches an echelon of superlative when executed most naturally. Praveen and Soundarya's most natural, yet traditional abhinaya won the audience. In “Yahi madhava yahi Keshava” Krishna eventually manages to placate Radha. He even fulfils her desire to wear his kinkini. It becomes a grand metaphor with the mingling of the micro and macro.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/Intensely-involved/article16298844.ece
1147,High degree of sophistication,VIDYA SARANYAN,2010-05-06,17:24:47 IST,"Meenakshi Srinivasan. Photo: M. Karunakaran
  | Photo Credit: M_Karunakaran The Kapaleeswarar temple has a unique aura that makes for an immediacy of the reach of the arts. And it was here that the Saraswati Educational Cultural and Charitable Trust had organised the Vasanta Utsav festival.On the inaugural day, the motley crowd could hardly miss the burning zeal and the high degree of sophistication of Meenakshi Srinivasan's Bharatanatyam. A disciple of Guru Venkatachalapathi and subsequently Alarmel Valli, Meenakshi has established a reputation for sincerity and expertise with her performances around the world.The programme planning and performance seemed to target the temple audience and factored in the absence of trappings such as the stage and curtain. Her recital that day revolved largely round Lord Siva and His consort. Abhinaya and nritta were given a balanced treatment. What stood out in Meenakshi's performance was the ability to create, communicate and sustain a particular mood without a single wrinkle.Thus the opening number ‘Ananda Natana Prakasham' in Kedaram could draw in the bliss as well as the contemplative nature of the Lord. The next number, a varnam, spotlighted the sringara aspect without losing sight of the divine nature of the beloved. Dhandayudhapani Pillai's ragamalika ‘Samiyai Azhaithodi Vaa' was interpreted as a dialogue where the sakhi's lack of comprehension of Siva's magnificence paved the way for the nayika to enlighten her. The choreography showed attention to detail: for instance, the Ardhanareeswara was depicted by contrasting the fiery locks of Siva with the long braid of the goddess.
Superb stamina
It was obvious that showmanship was a leading criterion here: following what seems to be today' s trend, the adavus for the theermanams were structured so that the artist was always hurtling around the performing space. One hardly got to witness a whole adavu; instead the long, complex patterns with different nadais were offered as incessant combos of different kinetic adavus. While one was full of admiration for the superb stamina and dedication of the artist (given that this is summer), one also wished some moments of calm had been built in.The abhinaya was a different story and there were numerous moments where one got to relish the artistic imagination. In ‘Jaya Jaya Durge', the goddess was revered not just as the vanquisher of demons but also of the evils within us. The contrasting images of raudram and vatsalyam were delivered with panache. Similarly, Meenakshi's involvement in abhinaya gave a lift to the Tamil piece ‘Dikku thereiyada kaatil.'It was in the thillana that the artist revealed her true mettle as the araimandi remained undiluted, the body lines stayed unfrayed as sollu alternated with the lines of the thillana as shudda nritta. The superb orchestral team of vocalist Hariprasad, Jaisri Ramanathan's nattuvangam, Kalaiarasan's violin and Vedakrishnan's mridangam galvanised Meenakshi's dancing to greater heights.The Kapaleeswarar temple resounded with dha dhindhinda… syllables not often heard in the Chennai air. As devotees turned the corner to the mandapam in the temple, the reason became clear. Kaveri Sageder and Sheetal Kolwalkar, disciples of Shama Bhate from Pune, were presenting a Kathak performance for the Vasant Utsav.For their performance, they used recorded music of high quality. The music ranged from the classical to semi-classical, and, in their words, 'world music'. Rather than stick to lengthy delineations of taal and its nuances, the duo chose short pieces with more of abhinaya content. Perhaps this was to ensure that the Chennai citizen got to comprehend Kathak better.
Dynamic rhythm
It was the dynamic rhythm presentation of teen tal that stole the show. The pieces revealed the dancers' competency in footwork and their control. The introductory number ‘Om Nama Shivaya' followed with the elaboration of teen taal was gripping and impressed the audience with some crystal clear footwork. The five inch wide ghunghroos, the slapping sound of the feet on the granite floor and the whirling skirts of Kaveri and Sheetal projected some weighty fare.Here, the two dancers presented the ginti, taatakar and taat which helped display their skill and experience. If one came looking forward to some challenging sawal jawab sessions, one left disappointed. For the rest of the programme turned out to be a collection of songs which although pleasing to the eyes, fell short on substance. While they offered some lively dancing, the really weighty points of the Kathak style were left unexplored.The abhinaya pieces came in quick succession and set a spirited tone. Maestro Bhimsen Joshi's bhajan ‘Krupa sarovar' extolled the compassion of Krishna and the Ganesha stuti rendered by Shankar Mahadevan reflected the creative bent of Lord Siva. But the Mahadev Sutaha became a piece more memorable for the noisy musical effects than the energetic dancing by the duo. The classicism of such features such as the wrist movements and the stylised walk were overshadowed by the light content of the music; sweet to see but powdery as snow. Even if the dancing per se remained undiluted, the end product varied depending on whether the music was classical or not.The tandav stood out for restrained delivery of Siva's synergy. This piece helped the recital stay on an even keel; the destructive and the creative aspects were powerfully projected through mime and pure rhythm. The finale ‘Vande Mataram' was well performed.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/High-degree-of-sophistication/article16299937.ece

  Celebrations across the week for World Dance Day (April 29) saw Bharatanatyam star Chitra Visweswaran in a lecture/demonstration concentrate on the communicative strength of classical dance, the evocative snippets by her disciple Vijay Madhavan and Chitra highlighting aspects of rhythm, gesture and word, and how detailing in dance conveys the message to the viewer — thematic concerns like animals, natural beauty, writing, etc., not straying from the world of the young into esoteric poetry.Spic Macay's evening projection at JNU had the legendary Birju Maharaj weave his Kathak spell, the evening tracing, in Maharaj's inimitable way, how rhythm, implicit in every activity of creation, acquires a visual dimension through movement images and vocabulary of rhythm in dance. The earlier half of the evening featured an enthralling Kuchipudi duet by Raja and Radha Reddy, Raja's tandav brilliance in “Adenamma” in Paras portraying Shiva's dance counter-pointed by the lasya lyricism in “Sringara Lahari” in Neelambari, describing the gracious beauty of the Devi. singing by Sai Bhavani sustained the performance despite the absence of Kaushalya Reddy's authoritative nattuvangam. The disciples with daughter Bhavana participating, impressed in nritta exploration. For a welcome change, tarangam was performed to the Natabhairavi composition of Ravi Shankar.
Dance and value
Natya Vriksha's annual observance of the occasion at the IIC saw a vigorous seminar on classical dance and its values to society at large. Asking how one values value, keynote speaker, renowned dancer/choreographer Kumudini Lakhia, spoke of creating values in classical dances which come with inbuilt structure of values. Individual creativity demanded new interpretations, keeping respect for ethics of the form and its aesthetics sacrosanct — intellectual engagement with different sections of society becoming inevitable for dancers today, asking themselves “Why do I dance?” Quoting several philosophers from Kant to Freud, academic Krishna Menon, Associate Professor, LSR College, questioned the importance of art in an unequal society as an assertion of cultural sovereignty and political importance. As soft power appealing to other states, art, unless involved with people, cannot claim strong ownership or association.But can dance with the body (a most wonderful and also most vulnerable instrument) as medium be compared with other art forms while making assessments? With Indian dance history written on the woman's body, society, given all the renaissance, does not place the art form on the highest pedestal, a point emphasised through practical references from a lifelong career in Odissi, by Aruna Mohanty.Calling dance a Yoga which can open windows otherwise permanently shut in human beings, enabling a reinvention and renovation to upgrade skills which have formed traditional wealth of legacies, art commentator and Chairperson of APPAN Shanta Serbjeet Singh pleaded for respecting the likes of our Langas and Manganiyars and adding value to their creativity. Principal, Gargi College, Meera Ramachandran spoke of dance as the amalgam of all arts. Lata Vaidyanathan referred to the challenges of teaching “learning to learn', classical dance adding to the value of different types of intelligences, amidst Bollywood and all other popular culture. Malabika Mitra extolled Creator and the Created, being the same as in Nataraja.
The performances
That the best value is what comes as an irrepressible urge from the dancer's innermost being was shown by Pravat Kumar Swain, who, with his grace with assertive strength, angika exactitude, total immersion of being in the dance, was the find of the evening Young Dancers' Festival. Riveting Odissi by this 23-year-old covered mangalacharan on the Panchabhoota, Varshamisaran portraying the ecstatic response to first rains, and the delightful rhythms built round Konarak Kanthi — with the Thai Nata “Ta hamta hat tat ta” mnemonics of Debaprasad Das' creation woven into the choreography (making the audience sway) — and finally the natya-filled Ramayana passages of Hanuman in Ashokavan meeting Sita to present the choodamani. Wings led by Aruna Mohanty were competently manned with Vijay Kumar Brik (mardala) and Roopak Kumar Parida (vocal) and excellent violin and flute. This Gotipua trained youngster, for several years under Aruna, is a natural, and heralds a new era re-discovering the male body in Odissi.Shloka Vaidyalingam trained by the Reddys, gave a competent Kuchipudi presentation foot-sure in rhythm with fair abhinaya understanding, highlighted through the Ganapati invocation in Gaula, Tiruvottiyur Tyagiah varnam in Kedaram “Saami Nee Rammanave” with sringar interspersed with the rhythmic virtuosity of jatis led by Kaushalya's nattuvangam, and tarangam in Arabhi.Sneha Chakradhar's assertive Bharatanatyam with excellent rhythmic understanding (evident right from the alarippu in Tisram with mnemonics differently arranged from the conventional) and the Poorvikalyani Dandayudapani varnam “Saamiyai vara solladi”, was creditable for proven familiarity with the text from one not born to the languages of South India, barring words like “Bhoomi-pugazhum, and Kallatanam” which needed more elaboration.But while Nadanamadinar in Vasanta visualising the magnificence of the dancing Nataraja was fine in tone, the varnam, in the nayika's persuasion of the sakhi to carry her message of love to Kartikeya, would have shone more with some soft and more lyrical touches, contrasting the power. Geeta Chandran's nattuvangam added a special high point to the competent musical effort.Disciple of Malabika Mitra, Saurav Roy is a trained dancer. But too much speed in the Teen tal drut passages made flailing of hands sans aesthetics and sharp focus in movement.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/Value-creation-in-Indian-dance/article16298772.ece

  A Bharatanatyam recital by Keerthi Panicker caught the attention of rasikas at Vyloppilly Samskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram, for the youthful exuberance of the artiste. This up-and-coming artiste is a senior disciple of the Dhananjayans of Barathakalanjali, Chennai. All the items in her recital were choreographed by her gurus themselves.Keerthi began with a Ganapathi stuthi, a composition by Karaikudi R. Krishnamurthy. She moved on to another beautiful piece in praise of Lord Nataraja in raga Lathangi, set to Adi tala. Keerthi maintained an elegant approach in her presentation of this joyful dance, which according to myth, the Lord in Chidambaram performed at the request of the saints.Keerthi then took up ‘Nritypahaaram' varnam ‘Bhaavayami Reghuraama' by Semmangudi Sreenivasa Iyer. The piece, a summary of the Ramayana, was perfect in Keerthi's hands. Her movements and striking turnings had a scintillating flow and the whole story was conveyed with élan.Following this Keerthi essayed two challenging presentations portraying two totally different emotions of nayikas. ‘Netranthi neerathile,' is a padam in raga Lathangi that portrays the nayika's fury towards Lord Murugan, whom she sees at the river bank in the company of other women. Keerthi depicted the ‘khandita' nayika in this piece, which ends with the efforts of the nayika trying to convince her beloved to come back to her.The next piece in ragamalika is about a nayika (Radha) who is despondent over the ‘viraha' (separation) from Lord Krishna, and the nayika's conversation with her sakhi. Radha tries to draw a picture of Lord Krishna only to find that she cannot recollect his face.
Excellent depiction
These two absolute abhinaya pieces demand a lot of facial expressions and Keerthi has skilfully transported the theme to the highest level thanks to her excellent training. Her control over abhinaya in the two padams was absolute.Keerthi concluded her recital with a tillana in raga Behag. Also included in the programme was a thematic representation of a prayer to Lord Guruvayurappan by artistes from Bharathakalanjali.Keerthi was accompanied by Santha Dhananjayan on the nattuvangam.

He is a goal scorer. So he is our Wayne Rooney, I guess,” Horner said, comparing Vettel with the Manchester United and England striker Rooney.“I think Sebastian is the driver to beat in the championship at the moment. He is the driver in the best form with arguably the fastest car.”Asked to what characterises Vettel as a forthcoming champion, Horner said: “Number One is speed. Number two is intelligence and number three his personality. These are three major attributes that he has.“He is very straightforward. He is a very pleasant guy to deal with. He is a very intelligent driver. He knows what he wants from the car. He has a very good feeling for the car combined with a lot of natural talent. He is obviously very hungry and he is a big motivation within the team.”Vettel, 22, was runner-up to Jenson Button in 2009 championship and currently lies fifth in the championship with 45 points from four races, 15 behind the leader Button. The German won the Singapore GP but was stopped in leading position it the opening races in Bahrain and Australia by technical problems.“We have a very good car. In the first two races, Sebastian was in the position to win. If there were not the issues on Sebastians car he would have won the first two races,” said Horner.Horner named the championship “very, very open with three different winners in the first for races” and said that his team has all but ideal combination of drivers with the youngster Vettel and the experienced Australian Webber, who lies eighth with 28 points.“I think that we do have a very good balance in the team.

  Formula One fans seem to have lost interest in Michael Schumacher and favour Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher’s former manager said in an interview published on Thursday.However, the ex-manager Willi Weber also warned against writing off record world champion Schumacher, who is struggling in his comeback season from a three-year hiatus.Replaced by former spokeswoman Sabine Kehm as manager, Weber is still responsible for Schumacher’s merchandising and told Bild daily that sales are from those of the past.“Sales are not how I expected them to be. There is a certain Schumi-tiredness. The people are saying: my god, where is he driving? You only know him as a winner,” Weber told Bild.“In the past the tribunes were full of Ferrari caps. Now I can count the silver caps with one hand.” Schumacher won five of his world titles with Ferrari and came out of retirement for Mercedes GP this season on a three-year contract.The 41-year-old has had a modest season so far with just 10 points from four races.Weber said that the Red Bull driver Vettel has filled the void as German top driver.“Wherever I look, Vettel is the new Schumi, he is the number one in the TV ads and on the billboards. Michael has left a void and Sebastian has grown into it, because he has the success and Michael doesn’t have it yet,” Weber said.Weber expects an undisputed victory from Vettel at the next race on Sunday in Spain but is also convinced that Schumacher will rebound in the end and win again, even if it takes until next year.“I suffer with Michael when I see how he was passed down the ranks in China. But he will work until everything fits. If all goes well he will get a race win this season. But don’t write Michael off.

  The Big Temple inspires one with a sense of awe, at its scale, grandeur and magnificence. But if you are looking for understated elegance, head for the Twin temples (Irattai Koil) of Kizhaiyur. These are two early Chola temples of stone, miniscule in comparison with the Big Temple, but enchanting, nevertheless. From inscriptions we learn that the temple complex was called Avani Kandarpa Iswara Griham. It was built by a Pazhuvettaraiyar chief, who was a contemporary of Aditya Chola I, and who bore the titles of Avani Gandharvan, Gangamarthandan, Kaliyuganirmoolan, Maravan Maladhalan and Araiyagal Araivuli. The Dwajasthambam was built by yet another Pazhuvettaraiyar- Ranamukharaman.According to S.R. Balasubrahmanyam, the earliest inscription in the temple complex, is of the 13th regnal year of Aditya Chola. But there are those who believe that this inscription is of a later period. This inscription records a gift for burning a perpetual lamp in the two shrines, under the orders of Nakkan Pazhuvettaraiyan Kumaran Kandan. Many other Pazhuvettaraiyars are mentioned in inscriptions in the two temples, and are also referred to as Maravar, Vadugar and Kaikkolar.(For admirers of writer Kalki, the name Pazhuvettaraiyar would have a special connotation. ‘Ponniyin Selvan' bristles with intrigue and vengeance, the Pazhuvettaraiyar Brothers behind all the trechery.)Inscriptions in the villages of Kizhapazhuvur and Melapazhuvur, which are just a few miles from Kizhaiyur, also talk of the Pazhuvettaraiyars. An inscription of the 12th regnal year of Parantaka I, seen in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple in Kizhappazhuvur, talks of the victory won by Pazhuvettaraiyar Kandan Amudanar, over the Pandyas, and their Ceylonese ally, at the battle of Vellin, in which the Pandya king lost his life. To commemorate this victory, the commander Nakkan Sathan made a gift for a perpetual lamp in the Alandurai Mahadeva temple.But who were the Pazhuvettaraiyars? Their origin seems somewhat of a mystery. The Anbil plates of Sundara Chola mention one of Parantaka I's queens as the daughter of “the Kerala King, who was called Pazhuvettaraiyar.” So were the Pazhuvettaraiyars from the Chera kingdom?The deity in the Kizhapazhuvur temple, has been sung of by Gnanasambandar, in the second Thirumurai, 34th padhigam. Verses four and eleven explicitly state that Malayali Brahmins were the priests in the Vadamulanatha (Alandurai Mahadeva) temple. Thevaram scholar Dr. R. Narayanan says, “In the Dharmapuram adheenam publication, the word ‘maraiyaalar' in verse five, meaning Vedic scholars, is also interpreted as ‘Malayali Brahmins.'” Thus although there was a Malayali presence in the Pazhuvur region, there is no conclusive proof that the Pazhuvettaraiyars were of Chera origin.The twin temples of Kizhaiyur, however, have not been sung of in the Thevaram. The Southern shrine in the Kizhaiyur temple complex is referred to in inscriptions as Thenvayil Sri Koil. An inscription of the time of Rajendra Chola says that two persons guilty of homicide had to surrender their land to the Kizhaiyur temple. Another inscription also of Rajendra I's time shows that provision was made for paying a ‘nattuvakkani'- dance master.The twin temples are West facing, and Umapathy sthapati says that it can be inferred from this that the temples were built for a special purpose. If there was a threat from an enemy, or if there were internecine quarrels in a community, or if there had been a famine, then a West facing temple would be built. This is true of both Vaishnava and Siva temples.Another early Chola temple complex is the one at Moovar Koil, but the difference is that in Moovar Koil, both the temples have the same type of sikhara. But in Kizhaiyur, the Southern shrine has a square sikhara, while the smaller northern shrine of Choleeswaram (now called Arunchaleswaram), has a round sikhara.Umapathy explains that whether it is a Siva temple, or a Vishnu temple, the sikhara and pattern of the temple will depend on the type of idol to be installed. If it is a Vishnu temple, then construction will be according to whether the idol is to be sayana, asana,or sthanaka. If it is a representation of a vibhava avatara like Trivikrama, then the rules of iconometry will be different, and the temple pattern will also be different.In the case of a Siva temple, one could have Nagara (square), Dravida (octagonal) or Vesara (circular) sikhara depending upon the Linga chosen. Usually, the sikhara will have to be in the same category as the Linga. Thus if a Nagara linga is decided upon, then the sikhara will also be Nagara.The idol of the Nandi facing the garba griha in the Southern shrine, looks reposeful. The folds of the skin at the neck make it look so lifelike, that one is almost tempted to touch it to make sure it is indeed a stone sculpture and not a real bull!
Brimming with energy
In the mukhamantapa, we find lion pillars. The lions seem to brim with energy, ready to spring on you. In the Vedas, the lion represents energy and the elephant beauty, explains Veezhinathan sthapati. Only animals and birds mentioned in the Vedas such as peacocks, swans, elephants etc. would find a place in temples, he says.Outside the sanctum sanctorum are four pillars, the tops of which can be made to rotate, according to a villager. He rues the fact that while until a few years ago, the tops of all four would rotate, now only one does. It was common for sculptors to display their skills by sculpting such pillars or by making a sphere in a yazhi's mouth rotate.In the mukhamantapa, is a beautiful sculpture of Siva and Parvati, which, unfortunately, is covered with oil, soot and grime. How can devotees be allowed to light lamps so close to the sculptures? There is yet another Nandi in a corner of the mukhamantapa. It is not clear where this came from.The northern shrine is also a two-tiered one, like the southern shrine. An inscription here shows that one of Raja Raja I's queens belonged to the Pazhuvettaraiyar clan. The inscription, of the 27th regnal year of Raja Raja, says that upon the request of his queen Nakkan Panchavan Mahadevi, the daughter of Avani Kandarpa Purattu Devanar of Pazhuvur, the king granted income from newly surveyed lands to the temple. The outer walls of both shrines have sculptures of Dakshinamurthy, Subrahmanya, and Brahma. Devotees have fixed huge bindis of vermilion and sandal on these sculptures.The vermilion powder might contain corrosive substances, which could damage the sculptures. But who is to make sure that devotees don't deface sculptures, in a temple that is unattended? Should a monument of this kind not have a guard?The brick and mortar gopuram of the complex is in a bad state, with plants growing on it. The yard is ill lit, and presents an unswept look, with bushes here and there. A board put up by the State Archaeology department lies uncared for on the ground. There is a ‘volunteer' priest, who doesn't seem to know much about conservation. It is a sad commentary on the regard we have for our treasures, when even a protected monument is in such a state of neglect.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/Picture-of-neglect/article16298790.ece
1156,The song paved the way,RANJANI GOVIND,2010-05-06,20:45:19 IST,"Sangita Kalanidhi M. Chandrasekaran. Photo: V. Ganesan.
  | Photo Credit: V_Ganesan Just as Helen Keller said in many of her writings, India's visually impaired and much acclaimed violinist M. Chandrasekaran also feels: “It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision…” He adds: “My mother imparted a rich visualisation of the world, and got me inclined to the melodic world. When I look back, I feel even with eyesight, I wouldn't have achieved so much…”Chandrasekaran, rewinding to his initial days of hard work and resolve, brought in an overpowering sense of musicality to the conversation and enriched it with spontaneous serenades, explanations and demonstrations. “You have to get a face-to-face feel of my musical personality, only then can you write,” his modest expressions went on unrestrained.Struck by a severe form of jaundice even before he had turned two, his mother Charubala Mohan, a violinist, was forced to take a decision to get his eyes removed to avoid further damage. “My mother showed the nerve and fortitude to go ahead. “That was just the beginning of her determination… before long she learnt Braille and put me on a daily routine of Braille-and-violin-classes everyday,” recalls the violinist who lost his father when he was seven.Born in Kolkata, Chandrasekaran spent his early years in Kanpur, and has lived in Tamil Nadu (Tiruvaiyaru and later Chennai) for the last 65 years. “My mother says I could recognise ragas even as a three-year-old and was constantly humming, which provided a background to her mundane, household chores. It was difficult for me to hold the violin on my leg and use the bow. My mother moved heaven-and-earth for hours together everyday to see me balance the instrument and get the bowing mechanism right, ” recalls Chandrasekaran.Vocal lessons, as a rule, preceded his violin classes. Only after he mastered the sangatis and got the bhava right could he try it on the violin, he says. “You have to sing on the violin,” my mother insisted “and years later I realised that it had helped me bring clarity in my expressions.” Vocal music too became a significant constituent of his presentations and as a 11-year-old, he had already stepped on to the stage. In 1950, he received the Best Violinist Award (as a 13-year-old) from the Music Academy in Chennai. He continued his vocal lessons under Mannargudi Sambasiva Bhagavatar and Kumbakonam Vishwanatha Iyer. Later, he was trained in padam rendering by Vidyala Narasimha Naidu and even today he renders padam and javalis along with his daughter for Bharatanatya recitals, the recent ones being their Cleveland Festival performances.“It was during my growing up years that my mother often took me to the sacred festivities in temples and that's where my senses opened up to the sublime “Yadukula Kambodhi” and Gambheeranatte raga on nadaswara.” Chandrasekaran's Todi on the National Programme of AIR came in for appreciation by nadaswara vidwans of the late 1950s and the manner in which he essayed Kadanakuthoohala had Rajaratnam Pillai comment: “This hand is going to play lakhs of krithis.” Consciously, he was taken to the nadaswara style and the unique chemistry of the wind-instrument was also evident in his playing. The amalgam was palpable vidwans T.Chowdiah, Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu would often notice this.Chandrasekharan has accompanied an entire gamut of stalwarts from old-timers Ariyakudi, Maharajapuram Vishwanatha Iyer, GNB, Madurai Mani, flute Mahalingam to Dr. Balamurali Krishna, N. Ramani and the reigning stars of today. His solo performances termed ‘voco-violin' (with vocal renderings) have come in for appreciation although the master thinks, “accompanying has its challenges,” as he is known for his ‘deep shadow-follow' of the main artistes which requires a different mindset. And this painstaking focus has helped him deal with absolutely teasing pallavis, as also the age-old avadhana-pallavi set to more than one tala and simultaneously at that.Titles and honours run into several paragraphs for Chandrasekaran that include the Sangeetha Kalanidhi and the Sangeeth Natak Academy award and his profound gratitude to his mother has him running the ‘Charubala Mohan Trust' that honours music vidwans and conducts music programmes.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/The-song-paved-the-way/article16298846.ece

Manjunath (mridanga) in Bangalore.The performance, devoted entirely to the compositions of Muthuswami Dikshithar, included krithis in some rare ragas, the arohana, avarohana, and salient features of which were demonstrated lucidly, and handled with admirable felicity and finesse by the young vocalist. The opening number, “Kanakambari Karunyamrithalahari” in Kanakambari raga and tishra ekatala, was adorned with brief kalpana swaras highlighting the vivadi characteristics and jaru glides of the nishada and gandhara.“Mangalambayai Namasthe” in Malavasri raga and jhampa thala, beginning with the swarakshara ‘ma' in the tara sthayi was instantly arresting, and was followed by the beautiful krithi “Kumaraswaminam” in Asaveri.Sumadyuthi, generally equated with Simhendramadhyamam, was taken up for a short alapana that threw its unique identity and distinct ‘pa dha sa' usage into sharp focus. “Pamarajanapalini” was rendered with a few avartanas of kalpana swaras. The main raga of the evening, Shankarabharanam, was elaborated in a series of soft, mellifluous sancharas that combined spontaneity with technical virtuosity. “Akshayalinga Vibho” in mishra chapu thala featured an excellent neraval and kalpana swaras suffused with raga bhava at “Badarivana”, and was succeeded by a tani avarthana. The concluding item was “Sri Kamalambike Sive Pahimam” in Sri raga.The mellow majesty of the compositions and the uniformly sedate tempo maintained throughout, generated an effect that was different from that of the usual concert format in vogue. The accompanying artistes sustained and accentuated the underlying tenor of the recital with expert and appropriate responses. According to vocalist G. Ravi Kiran, the driving force behind Guruguhaamrta, the aim is “to preserve and propagate the singing of Dikshithar's compositions” through a series of concerts and lecture demonstrations, the material for which is sourced primarily from the “Sangeetha Sampradaya Pradarshini” of Subbarama Dikshithar.Along with clarifications about the musical form, explanations of the lyrics and their spiritual significance, and of literary embellishments such as rhyme, alliteration and assonance, and deployment of yathis and madhyamakala sahitya, which are integral components of the compositions, will definitely lead discerning listeners to higher levels of enjoyment and edification.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Rare-gems/article16298845.ece

  Kasturi Rangan's forceful and deep voice with waves of rolling akara conferred classical weight on his exposition in Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samiti's Bahula Panchami concert. Raga alapanas provided solid experience occasionally with excess vocalisation. Sancharas, deeply reflective, focussed on highlighting the radiance of the ragas, Sankarabharanam and earlier Pantuvarali.He freely let his voice unfold his manodharma and formulated its progress in vidwat idiom. With spells of inspiration, his talent combined smoothness of music's flow with the chaste characteristics of classicism. This lofty approach and relevant technique indicated the lines of his grooming.Melodic majesty was his prized performing base. This could be sensed in the many variations in negotiating the tara sthayi segment. This to a great extent explained the pulsating pleasantness.
Impressive and creative
Sankarabharanam (‘Yaduta Nilachite') provided the core of the recital. Kasturi Rangan's creativity couched in elegant twists and turns counted for its impressiveness. Vocal immensity exerted its influence on providing Sankarabharanam's panoramic edifice. A major part of development explored many levels of the raga's reach. The phrasings documented the moorchana boundaries and the akara-packed raga complex was gradually presented.The interpretative method well communicated the loveliness of the kirtana. The flow of the sangatis was set against the grandeur of the piece. It hit the right aesthetic areas, a method imbibed from his guru Seshagopalan's style. It would do him much good to convert imitation to emulation and observe restraint for artistic effect. The first taste of the concert at the start, the Aarabhi Pancharatnam ‘Saadinchane' whetted the appetite for the rest of the songs — ‘Sangita Gnanamu' (Dhanyasi), ‘Evarikai' (Devamanohari) and ‘Dunmarga' (Ranjani). The rendering of the kirtanas in general drew strength from exuberance packed in them.While overall the singing represented Carnatic flavour, Kasturi Rangan's Pantuvarali alapana was in the ustad mode. The kirtana was ‘Appa Rama Bhakti.' It was not a single factor that ensured the brilliance of the programme. Voice, talent, guru's influence and steadfastness combined to project Carnatic solidarity.As against the thrustful approach of the vocalist, V.V. Srinivasa Rao, on the violin, softly textured the ragas Sankarabharanam and Pantuvarali in his solo sessions. His play incorporated gentle touches to the sancharas and the economy in building Sankarabharanam was noteworthy, stressing the essence concerted more than elaboration. It was a very respectable face of Sankarabharanam that he delineated.Mannarkoil Balaji's mridangam revealed a style of play wedded to laya substance.

  A month-long festival of dance and music was held at Venkitachalapathy Temple, Kumarapuram, Palakkad in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam celebration at the temple. The festival was a fine blend of performances by renowned as well as up-and-coming musicians.
Kanjhangad Sankaran Namboothiri's concert was mellifluous. The Carnatic vocalist was accompanied by Subbaraman (violin) and Mahesh Kumar (mridangam).He wooed the audience with the Adi tala varnam piece ‘Neranammithi' in Kannada. His rendition of an alapana of Lalitha was scholarly. Then came Subhapanthuvarali and the Tyagaraja kriti ‘Ennaalluage.' ‘Ennaalluage' had a niraval at ‘Konnalu sakethapuravasa…' Clear diction and apt gamakas had the audience captivated during this piece. Mahesh Kumar brought the feel of this kriti alive on his mridangam. Namboothiri then took ‘Saragunapalimpa' in Kedaragowla for detailed exposition. It was laced with creative swarakalpana, which paved the way to a brilliant tani.
Sublime renditions

Cherthala K.N. Ranganatha Sharma's recital captured the attention of music buffs with his sublime renditions that adhered to tradition. Cherthala Sivakumar (violin), Kumarapuram Hariharalakshmanan (mridangam) and Deepu (ghatam) accompanied the vocalist. Gifted with a resonant voice, Sarma's concert was marked for his emphasis on clear diction. He began his concert with a composition by Lalgudi Jayaraman – ‘Neeve gatiyani' in Nalinakanthi (Adi tala). This was followed by Papanasam Sivan's ‘Thathvamariyatharama' in Reethigowla and the rarely heard Bhagavatar's ‘Saranam Vijayasaraswathimaye' in the raga Vijayasaraswathi. ‘Saranam…' had a scholarly swaraprasthara.An alapana of Poorvikalyani, ‘Thillai Chidambaram,' was laced with brilliant manodharmaswara. Dikshithar's ‘Sreevenkatagireesamalokaye' breathed an air of bhakthi to the concert. A rendition of Tyagaraja's ‘Swararagasudharasa' had a well articulated niraval at ‘Mooladharaja…' This was followed by an impressive tani.
N.J. Nandini, a promising young artiste captivated the audience during her concert with her vocal range and aesthetic modulations that reminded the audience of her guru Bombay Jayasree. Thiruvizha Viju S. Anand (violin), A. Ganesan (mridangam) and Vivek (ghatam) accompanied Nandini.She started the concert with ‘Vanajakshi' in Kalyani. Dikshitar's ‘Sreemahaganapathiravathuma' in Gowla came next. Pattanam's ‘Mariveredikkevarayya' in Shanmukhapriya was ornamented with fast paced niraval amd swarprasthara at ‘Sannuthangasree.'A well-rendered ‘Sreerangappuravihara' and ‘Ninnujappakarana' were ensued by a neat portrayal of Kedaragowla. ‘Saragunapalimpa' was marked by clear sangathis. A complex ragam-tanam-pallavi in Bhairavi ‘Avan en sonthamadi, Govindanadi, Mukunthanadi' and a lively swarakalpana was followed by a superb tani.
Rajeswari Satish, a disciple of maestros M.A. Venugopal, C.S. Krishnayyar and P.S. Narayanaswami took the stage captivating connoisseurs with her pleasing stage presence and crystal-clear padanthara. Sampath (violin), Anilkumar (mridangam) and Dipu (ghatom) accompanied her. She began her concert with ‘Valachvachi' in Navaragamalikavarna that was sung in two speeds and followed by manodharmaswaras. Rajeswari dedicated the song ‘Tharumo nin karunakataksham' to Krishnayyar; a song that he himself composed in Saranga. A charming ‘Ninnenammithinayya' in Simhendramadhyamam was followed by the highlight of the evening, a sparkling Bhairavi. Dikshitar's ‘Balagopala' was ornamented with a niraval at ‘Neelaneeradasareera…' Cascading swarasanchara was followed by a brilliant tani.A performance by flautist K.S. Gopalakrishnan with T.H. Subrahmaniam (violin), Surendran (mridangam) and Guruprasanna (ganjira) was memorable. Gopalakrishnan began the concert with an Adi tala varnam in Darbar ‘Chalamela.' Dikshitar's ‘Mahaganapathim' in Natta had dazzling swaraprasthara. The violinist who was in tune with the flautist added allure to the concert. A crisp rendition of ‘Nadathanumanisam' in Chithranjani was followed by a leisurely alapana of Hindolam, ‘Govardhanagiresam.' It was laced with scintillating swara passages.The highlight of the concert was the luxurious treatment of Thodi. Short and crisp phrases and alternate playing between the flautist and violinist delighted the audience. A lively tani preceded a well-articulated niraval and swarasanchara. Gopalakrishnan wound up his concert with ‘Bhagyadalakshmi baramma' of Purantharadasa in Madhyamavathi.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Fine-blend-of-ragas/article16299075.ece

  | Photo Credit: N_SRIDHARAN Shantanu Bhattacharya's concert captured moments, where one could savour his guru. His performance included the repertoire of his first guru Prasun Bannerji, and had the makings of a scintillating session with Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty , in the great style of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Sahib. Shantanu performed with exuberance the challenging intricacies of the Patiala Gharana.The morning at the Little Play Coop began with the melodic strains of ‘Gunkali' in vilambit, madhya and dhrut laya, where the last piece , “Gao Gunkali Gunijan Mein Gao” showcased a wide variety in expression and technique.
Distinctive alaps
Miyan ki Todi was full of distinctive alaps, which spilled into three-four avartans in full meend and uchhals.He touched the higher notes, lacing them with bol-alaps and created a melody substantiating the raga in a great tradition. The taan patterns were varied and spectacular, restating and redefining the heights that an Ustad usually reaches. In short, Shantanu's performance was a picture-perfect recital reminiscent of his great musical lineage.The second half of the concert was an interactive session, during which Shantanu took ragas with similar swaras but with varying moods such as Jaunpuri and Darbari; Bihag and Maru Bihag; Multani and Miyan ki Todi and Bhopali and Deshkar. He spoke about the strong correlation between the time of the enunciation of the raga and its swaras- a correlation, he pointed out, that actually helped to unfurl a particular raga.For example in the raga Miyan ki Malhar, the combination of ‘ni dha ni sa' dramatises and denotes the coming of clouds. He also felt that Bahar cannot be sung, unless it is Spring and that Bhairav can never be performed in the evening. He also pointed out that occasionally, the composition hailed the ragas. Finally with the coming of Bhairavi, Shantanu demonstrated how all the thaats with their scales can be derived by shifting scales by one note.The two beautiful compositions from Bhairavi finally established that Shantanu had scaled great heights and finally would cement his place among India's top singers. On the tabla was Debashish, a prolific master of his genre and the two complimented each other perfectly.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Recital-upholds-musical-lineage/article16298787.ece

Umayalpuram Sivaraman mentioned that “Pramanam” meant taking an oath of allegiance and Vedavalli was an authority on many aspects of music. He also appreciated her boldness and was all praise for the way Vedavalli had prepared her disciples to make them render these kritis in its pristine form.Krishna wished that this disc had seen the light of the day some 30 years ago and cautioned against the loose manner in which the word Sampradaya was being used, in discussing issues. He called the album an authentic document, which should be listened to frequently to gain familiarity. He requested Vedavalli to continue to release such CDs for the benefit of both musicians and rasikas.In response, Vedavalli said that the CD was an attempt to preserve a 150-year old tradition and that she was not compelling anyone to follow the bhani.Mala Mohan of Swathy Soft Solutions and Sumathi Krishnan, a senior disciple of Vedavalli also narrated the pleasant learning experiences they underwent while getting this CD to its present form. Smt. Pankajavalli read out a “Vazhthuppaa” as a tribute to Vedavalli. The event was efficiently compered by Shivapriya, Vedavalli’s disciple.There was a soulful rendering of some of the kritis by Sumithra Vasudev, Malini and Sumathi Krishnan to the accompaniment of Ram on the mridangam, prior to the commencement of this function.

1162,First lady of nagaswaram,V. BALASUBRAMANIAN,2010-05-06,17:51:15 IST,"Nagaswara vidwan Madurai Ponnuthai in Madurai. Photo: S. James
  | Photo Credit: S_James. It is the third day of the Chithirai Brahmotsavam (Chithirai Peruvizha) of the Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. The simmering heat not withstanding, the milling crowd heads towards the temple and the asthana nagaswara vidwans are getting ready for their concerts. After the darshan, we set out to meet the octogenarian nagaswaram vidushi Madurai M.S. Ponnuthayi, once a regular at the temple festivals.Today, living on a paltry pension of Rs.1,000 and supported by her only son, this first lady of nagaswaram, who was once a sought after musician within the State and without, has turned philosophical and accepts life as it comes.Though she belonged to a family of musicians well versed in the flute, the violin and the mridangam, her father decided to train her in nagaswaram. Shifting base from their native village Ayakkudi near the Palani Hills, to Madurai, Ponnuthayi came under the tutelage of Madurai Natesa Pillai. The veteran recalls, “Classes would begin in the morning and would go on for hours. In fact, my guru was criticised for teaching a tiny girl.” The instrument requires plenty of lung power and energy to produce sound in a sustained manner for several hours. Hence, the nagaswaram was dominated by male players.
Rigorous practice
After classes, practice at home went on for hours. “These hours and hours of practice helped me overcome the initial struggle of even producing a note. My arangetram was in the 1940s. A huge crowd had gathered curious to see who the nine-year old girl playing the nagaswaram was, which hitherto was considered a male bastion. Soon the word spread and I was called to play as a supporting artist for many leading vidwans. Concerts with T.N. Rajaratnam Pillai, Tiruvengattaar and Tiruveezhimizhalaiyar are still etched in memory. I was just in my teens then!” Ponnuthayi has even played in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.“I played for AIR Tiruchi first in 1946 and this went on till about 1989. This helped a lot in my name spreading faster. Offers to play at temple festivals and marriage functions started pouring in. Naturally, I formed my own group comprising support nagaswaram, thavil players and talam. It was support from temples that helped sustain us. Getting noticed at such festivals earned us opportunities to play in marriages. I was never bogged down by the taxing schedules of temple processions which went on for 12 hours at times! As if to prove a point against my detractors, I withstood this strenuous schedule, thanks to the Blessings of the Almighty,” Ponnuthayi remembers and shows us some old photographs of hers with child-like enthusiasm.“My popularity grew beyond Madurai and I started playing elsewhere in the State. Once during a performance in Kerala, I received a medal from the organisers after I was pitted to play against a local nagaswaram player. Mind you, it was an impromptu competition.” She has played continuously for three years in the late 40s in Sabarimalai, as a thanksgiving to Lord Ayyappan, the presiding deity of the temple, whom she believes, saved her life when she was seriously ill during a concert tour of Kerala. She considers her concert at the Second World Tamil Conference a prestigious one.Ponnuthayi has many titles to her credit, the first being ‘Nada Gana Arasi' awarded by the Madurai Tamil Sangam and the last being the Kalaimamani. She values the appreciation of the audience during and after a concert more than titles and awards. “It is those humble words of appreciation that pep up the proceedings for me,” she says.
The master of Thodi
Her favourite ragam and player? “Thodi and TNR,” pat comes the reply. She continues, “Yes there are other ragams that I like but with Thodi, we can go on exploring its depths for hours. Again, TNR was the master of it.”Incidentally, Microsoft has taken a recording of Ponnuthayi's Thodi to be played at its headquarters in the U.S. under the category of Indian Music. Apart from M.S. Subbulakshmi, Ponnuthayi was the only other woman musician from South India to have been featured in an exhibition in Japan several decades ago. “An American girl Karisha King who visited this exhibition came all the way to learn nagaswaram from me for about a year.”Happily married to Madurai Chidambara Mudaliar, she went on to scale greater heights as he encouraged her tremendously. He was a Legislative Council Member for about three years and was part of the Congress party. It was after his passing away in 1972 that her professional life took a downward slide; engagements for playing in weddings abruptly stopped because of the prevalent stigma of a widow playing the mangala vadyam.About music then and now, Ponnuthayi has this to say. “We had to really toil hard to learn a kriti or a ragam. It took several months before we could master them. Today it is vice versa. Everything is available in capsules and is just a click away. Kritis are grasped at a rapid pace and forgotten as quickly.” She demonstrates by singing the Hamsadhwani varnam which she learnt when she was nine. The sruti alignment at this ripe age is something unbelievable.Her grandson Vigneswaran, a mridangam vidwan, has started learning the basics of nagaswaram from her.

1163,‘An artist is responsible for enhancing music quality',LALITHAA KRISHNAN,2010-05-06,17:31:34 IST,"Letting his deft fingers do the talking as they work magic on the strings, vainika Bonala Sankara Prakash is the walking, strumming proof that hard work pays. His music mirrors a rare blend of technique and aesthetics, strength and tenderness, creativity and accountability within the framework of tradition. The artist shares his thoughts on the present and future of the veena in the cutcheri milieu and the discipline that goes into the making of an artist.

Initial Steps…
I began playing the veena at age of five and gave my first full length concert at 9. My mother Ramani and father Bonala Jagannathan are veena and vocal vidwans. My father, who is my guru, remains my greatest source of inspiration. He imparted the subtleties of sampradaya sangeetham with emphasis on the techniques of veena playing. He was a disciple and close associate of the late Vasa Krishnamurthi, a legendary veena vidwan of the Bobbili tradition, renowned for four centuries. My maternal grandfather, trained in classical music, was also a mridangam artist in the bhajana sampradaya. He ensured that I stayed constantly tuned to musical thought.
Fostering the listening habit…
My father often took me to vocal and instrumental concerts of stalwarts, particularly the annual series in Vishakapatnam. Immersed in music at that impressionable age, I experienced immense joy. Those unforgettable cutcheris have been an everlasting source of inspiration for the contemplation and analysis of the myriad intricacies of melody, rhythm and technique, then and now.
Reaping harvest through sadhana…
Following the example of my father and guru who put in at least 10 hours of practice daily, I followed this schedule diligently for 25 years. Today, this sadhana stands me in good stead. Initiated early into manodharma aspects in a natural and phased manner, I find that its boundless creative scope gives me the highest satisfaction as an artist. Technique is a means to an end. Once command over technique is achieved, the musician tends to devote more time to contemplation. This inner communion leads to manifestation of greater bhava.
Evolving a style…
An artist’s style evolves as the result of years of experience, assimilation and absorption. I work towards an ideal combination of heavy gamakas and ravai sangatis through coordination of right and left movements to realise the maximum potential of the veena as well as sahitya bhava sans unnecessary meetu. This approach has contributed to my handling of ragam, tanam, pallavi and niraval. Singing whatever I learnt before playing it has ensured that my instrumental expression closely shadows the vocal.
Responsibility as an artist…
The celestial timbre (naadam) of the veena strings has filled my waking hours and been my mainstay since childhood. The Saraswathi veena has been revered since ancient times and the vainika aims for closest possible adherence to vocal expression. Every artist carries the responsibility of enhancing the quality of music and the aural experience and garnering greater exposure for quality music. I believe in one putting one’s shoulder to the wheel to produce ennobling music. I leave no stone unturned in this endeavour.
The role of AIR…
As a staff artist, I have received great encouragement from AIR right from the beginning. The awards I won at AIR annual competitions spurred me on to translate my passion into my profession. My participation in South Zone concerts, National Programmes, RTP specials and award-winning musical features such as ‘Ekoham Bhavishyami’ on AIR as well as Doordarshan programmes were enriching experiences. The opportunity of listening up close to AIR concerts of great musicians has been a steady source of inspiration, ideas and insight.
The current scenario with regard to the veena…
Nowadays, few students opt for the veena due to the hard work, late rewards and difficulties involved in portability of the instrument. We need new entrants with the commitment to take it up as a full time profession. While it is heartening to note that some organisations have begun convening veena fests, it would be a fillip to see more vainikas featured in regular concert series. As an artist, I look forward to performing opportunities on a wider platform to create and sustain audience interest.
Performance chart…
In addition to solos, I also give jugalbandhis and have performed with Hindustani musicians such as Purbayan Chatterjee and Janardhan Mitta.
Awards and recognition…
I got the gold medal from the Vishaka Music Academy (1996) and Best Performance award for three consecutive years from Navya Nataka Samithi (1984-86). I have received Sankranthi Puraskar from the Pushpagiri Peetam and to have been honoured as Asthana Vidwan of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam (2008). In 2006, at the request of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams, I tuned devotional songs for the Bhajana Yagna project and conducted the music for 108 songs in an audio release.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/lsquoAn-artist-is-responsible-for-enhancing-music-quality/article16298776.ece
1164,Ragas handled with profundity,PVK,2010-05-06,17:09:21 IST,"The composing of thillanas, since the earliest known composer of this musical form Melattur Veerabadriah, has undergone many changes and the last century has seen many vidwans who have made their contributions as composers of thillanas. It would be no exaggeration to state that the art of composing thillanas has reached its zenith with the creations of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Jayaraman's thillanas have gained immense popularity among music lovers, vocal and instrumental performers and have been acclaimed by the traditionalists as well.Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and his sister Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi have presented eight thillanas of their illustrious father in this audio compact disc brought out by Charsur Digital Work Station.The Desh raga thillana is the composer's one of the most popular compositions, probably next to the evergreen Mohanakalyani thillana. The siblings have chosen an appropriate kalapramanam for this opening number and is an apt curtain raiser for the fare which follows.
Clear lyrical content
Great care has been given to the bowing by the violinists while rendering the sahitya portions and the differentiation between the jati syllables and the sahitya are clearly distinguishable. The sahityas do not become an extension of the jatis. The lyrical contents are distinctly clear in the charanam sections.Karnaranjani raga, sporting a tricky Arohanam ‘SRGMGPDS' has a sampoorna Avarohanam ‘SNDPMGRS' (derivative of Kharaharapriya), has been handled with the genius of the composer in the thillana in this raga. It is very sensitively played and does not portray the raga as a mere scale. The melody comes out in full glory and is very engaging.The next number is the adi (tisra nadai) tala set Behag raga thillana which was frequently rendered by M.L. Vasanthakumari in her concerts.Following this are thillanas in Bageshri, Vasanti, Bimplas, Dwijavanti and Madhuvanti. These ragas are very well suited for compositions which serve as tukkadas in a concert. The Vasanti raga thillana is the lengthiest one in this disc and has an eerie opening which suits the melody and warrants a second listening.Perfection has been Lalgudi's hallmark and his offspring live up to this reputation in this disc.The percussionists J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and S. Karthick (ghatam) are seasoned artists and follow the compositions like a shadow. Their playing greatly enhances the listening pleasure.

1165,Sketching ragas with ease,G. SWAMINATHAN,2010-05-06,16:48:03 IST,"SWEET VOICES: The Serugudi Sisters.
  The vocal concert of the Serugudi Sisters at Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam was creditable because they included some compositions which are not often heard on concert platforms. A Tamil varnam in Atana provided a zestful start to the proceedings. Tyagaraja's ‘Ninne Bhajana' in Nattai and ‘Graha Balamemi' in Revagupti were pointers to the siblings' interest in projecting the raga images with emphasis on specific sangatis. A few strands of tepid swaras were affixed to the Revagupti kriti.Rema ventured on the elaboration of Rishabhapriya with motifs strong enough to distinguish it from Charukesi. ‘Mahathmule Teliyaleruni' by Mysore Vasudevachar augured well with the dynamism of the kriti adding swara sallies on ‘Mahi Sudha', the anupallavi line. The niraval surfaced only in the Ritigowla kriti of Tyagaraja ‘Chera Ravathe', on ‘Talli Tandri Leni Bala Tana Nathu' with swaras; but here, notwithstanding a melodic raga like Ritigowla, the niraval fell short of emotional aspect.
Well-rehearsed
The core piece was Madhyamavati, which was taken up by Geetha as preface to the Tyagaraja composition ‘Venkatesa Ninnu'. Here the swaras were on the pallavi and moved to the extended kuraippu swara sorties with ‘sadhjam' as the landing note. All swara exchanges in this concert were concluded by both the sisters, with well rehearsed and impressive korvais. On the positive side, the sisters articulate well with full throated expressions. Rationally speaking, they recite well but the missing part is the internalisation of any raga or song which would add charm to the raga, kriti or swara. Well, spontaneity is different from a forced synthetic approach.The fast paced phrases in raga alapana and swara surges can temporarily impress the audience; but it is the evenness in the alapana and how the raga is spread out that will help the performers in the long run. Both Rishabapriya and Madhyamavati were good treatises but offered nothing special or specific to muse or ruminate over later either by the rasika or the singers. This statement holds good for the theoretically correct interpretations of songs sans soul too.With the voices almost identical, sweet and in their control, experience should impart the importance of searching for the spirit and sharing the same with the listener…this is musical wisdom. Hope Rema and Geetha learn this. A few more pleasing kritis were in their kitty; ‘Srihari Vallabhe' in Suddha Dhanyasi by Mysore Vasudevachar, ‘Ranganayakam' in Nayaki by Dikshitar, ‘Manavyala' in Nalinakanti by Tyagaraja and ‘Smarajanaka' in Behag by Swati Thirunal were worth recording.Kovai Chandran more or less presented the raga images in the same style as that of the sisters, offering sound without much soul. Kalakkad R. Srinivasan and Rajaraman on the mridangam and the ghatam provided able support and a tad aggressively framed ‘thani'.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Sketching-ragas-with-ease/article16298754.ece

  Carnatic vocalists Ranjani and Gayatri are among the top artistes on the Carnatic music scene today. As youth icons, they bolster one's confidence in the future of Carnatic music. It was fitting that Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Delhi, honoured them with the title of “Nada Bhushanum” during its annual Tyagaraja festival not long back.Gayatri said the award was a recognition of their hard work and dedicated it to their parents, rasikas and accompanying artistes.Ranjani and Gayatri are known for their melodious and vibrant voices, and their fertile imagination has won them rasikas from across the world.Ranjani takes the lead in sharing her views on the invaluable compositions of the musical Trinity — Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastri. She feels they seem fresh even years after they were composed. “When the audience listens to a kriti, it should make them to sit up and experience the wonder of the raga,” says Ranjani. “As performers we try to bring out the beauty and joy of the raga which is intangible. The listeners should be able relate their feelings with the raga.”Gayatri, bright-eyed, continues: “Without deviation from the traditional system we like to explore new ideas and be innovative in our approach.”Ranjani points out the debt of gratitude she and her sister owe to their parents for their interest in music and tirelessly taking them to concerts when they were young. “It laid a strong foundation. Music is a journey, and we both wish to travel as long as we can.” It was a journey that began with the violin. It was P.S. Narayanaswamy who recommended they give vocal performances, and thus began their metamorphosis from violinists to much sought after vocalists in the Carnatic music world. The duo's effortless singing, especially of vrittams, is a treat for listeners. Their diction and control over raga presentation in the fast tempo speak volumes for their hard work and dedication to maintaining quality. Calling their father a perfectionist, they say they owe their success to him.Gayatri adds, “We have come a long way in vocal performance. What our fingers used to speak, we are expressing vocally. Exposure to Hindustani music has helped us, but music is beyond boundaries. Listening to various forms of music helps a singer, since the good values of music get into your system unconsciously, effortlessly.”Ranjani recollects her teenage years as an accompanist to stalwarts like D.K. Pattamal. They remember her generosity in accepting the child artiste. “The humility and will to make the accompanying artiste comfortable in those days are values we wish to imbibe and cherish,” says Ranjani.Though popular performers, the sisters are cautious of excess. Ranjani says they space out their concert schedule to ensure the health of their vocal chords. “The numbers are not important. We wish to give memorable performances.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Two-to-crescendo/article16299942.ece
1167,Tribute to Swati Tirunal,A. Sangameswaran,2010-05-06,16:26:22 IST,"Shreyas Narayanan
  A three-day festival of dance and music dedicated to Swati Tirunal was held at Sree Koodalmanickam temple in Irinjalakkuda.The concert on the first day was by Shreyas Narayanan. He was accompanied by Nellai Ravindran (violin), Melattur Balasubramanian (mridangam) and Thrikkakara Y.N. Santharam (ganjira).A disciple of P.S. Narayanaswamy, Shreyas maintained the purity and perfection of the tradition he belongs to and sang each kriti in a tempo that best suited the piece, thereby enhancing the beauty of the whole recital. The swara passages he sang for the opening piece ‘Devadevakalayamithe’ in Maayamaalavagowla were reminiscent of the Semmangudi bani. The grandeur of Atana was revealed in the kriti ‘Sree Kumara Nagaraalaye’, which was sung at a slow pace.
Fast paced renditions
In contrast came ‘Jaya Jaya Padmanabha’ in Sarasaangi, in Madhyamakaala tempo and the accompanying swara passages. Bhairavai was taken for alapana before the Navarathri kriti ‘Jananimaamava’ and was tagged with niraval and swara passages. A fast paced ‘Bhogeendra sayinam’ in Kunthalavarali set the stage for the main kriti of the evening ‘Raamaraama Guna seema’ in Simhendramadhyamam. Shreyas rendered an erudite alapana, his full throated voice effortlessly scaling through the three octaves.While traversing through the upper octaves, he made sruthibhedam resulting in the raga Bhauli, which was later reproduced by the violinist in his solo essay. The kriti was well rendered with niraval and scintillating manodharma swaras. Nellai Ravindran on the violin and the percussion accompanists contributed to the success of the concert.A sedate ‘Raamachandraprabho’ in Sindhubhairavi, a kriti by Vanamaamalai ‘Janaki Ramana’ in Kaappi and an Abhang ‘Theerthavittala’ in Aaahir bhaiarv constituted the final phase of the concert.On the second day Mathangy Sathyamoorthy accompanied by Vayala Rajendran (violin), B. Jayaram (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreekanth (ganjira) gave a memorable concert. The artiste chose a fine blend of popular and rare kritis so as to please the crowd.The ‘Sarasijanabha’ in Kambhoji was followed by ‘Pahi Sreepathe’ in Hamsadhwani for which she sang an array of swaras. Panthuvaraali was executed in detail and was followed by the kriti ‘Saarasaakshaparipalaya’.
Supple voice
This as well as ‘Kripayapaalaya’ in Charukesi and ‘Maamavasada’ in Kanada was well received by the audience. ‘Bhavaye Padmanabhayiha’, a rarely heard Madhyamaavathi kriti was rendered well. Lalyani was taken for a detailed alapana revealing all its glow and charm before the kriti ‘Paripahimaamayi’, which was the main item for the day. Her supple voice and amazing control over it gave an added colour to the whole concert. ‘Bhajabhajamaanasa’ in Sindhubhairavi and a thillana in Dhanasri concluded the concert.The third day had Moozhikulam Harikrishnan, an up-and-coming singer, rendering ‘Rama Rama pahi’ (Devagandhari), ‘Sree Parvathi’ (Bhauli) and ‘Kalayedevadevam’ (Ranjini) among other kritis. He showed promise during his Kalyani alapana followed by the kriti ‘Sundareeneedivyamu’. He was ably assisted by Aadarsh (violin), the grandson and disciple of Nedumangad Sivanandan and by Krishnachandran (mridangam).
Display of histrionic skills
A Bharathanatyam solo by another promising youngster Aiswarya Raj was the final event of the festival. The dancer displayed her histrionic skills during the Bhairavi pada varnam.‘Shankara Srigiri' in Hamsanandi brought out the skills as a dancer in her as she portrayed the pranks of little mischievous Krishna in ‘Vishamakara Kannan’ of Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer.She wound up the recital with a Kunthalavarali tillana. Arun Gopinath (vocal), R.L.V. Anand (nattuvangam), Raghunath (flute) and Venu Kurumassery (mridangam) were the accompanists. In addition to these there were concerts by devotees and disciples before the main concerts. The fete was organised by Sree Koodalmanickam temple.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Tribute-to-Swati-Tirunal/article16298748.ece

  A flawless gayaki (singing) style is what most flautists strive to achieve. Amith Nadig has accomplished this and much more.Training under veteran R.K. Srikantan, Amith is one of the few youngsters to be awarded an A grade from the All India Radio. The flautist captivated the audience with his mellifluous music in a concert at Kochi recently.He began the concert with a sprightly rendition of the Abhogi varnam ‘Evaribodha' in three speeds. Mysore Vasudevachar's Roopaka tala composition in raga Kamboji, ‘Lambodara' had a neat niraval. Edapally Ajith (violin) followed it up with excellent swara essays Unexpected scale shifts and the ease in playing high octave passages marked the flautist's swaraprasthara. Considering the difficulty in achieving clarity in fast phrases in high octaves, this was a good feat by the young flautist.
Erudite performance
Next came a brisk rendition of ‘Niravadhi sukhada' in raga Ravichandrika. The best alapana was of a subsidiary piece in Kalyani, in which the artiste adeptly caught the true fervour of the raga. The elaboration unravelled the artiste's wide manodharma and flexibility in merging quick, distant phrases together. The kriti chosen was Swati Tirunal's ‘Pankaja lochana' in Misra chappu tala.The korvai swaras came in all blends and delighted the audience. After a peak into Bilahari raga, Amith played ‘Smarasada manasa' in the same raga. A progressive approach to essay raga Keeravani saw the artiste follow the note-by-note approach. He covered all the essential nuances of the raga bringing out the quality of the raga. Tyagaraja's ‘Kalikiyunde gada' was rendered with a brief niraval on ‘Bhagavathagre sarulaku.'K.U. Jayachandra Rao on the mridangam left no loose ends, packing up the gaps fully. He was quick to grasp the rhythmic patterns of the swara phrases and caught up with the mukthaippus correctly. Amith seemed to muse at phrases as he went on improvising on single phrases in subtle myriad ways. The tani with just the mridangam was another flawless exercise.Amit retained the heaviness of the concert in the concluding pieces as well. ‘Govardhana giridhara' in Darbari Kanada and ‘Tamburi meetidava' in Sindhubhairavi. Thus in the few numbers that the flautist played, he could unfold the true Carnatic flavour and essence of the music. The programme was organised by Dharani society.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/Captivating-notes/article16298744.ece

1173,Anand fails to break the deadlock after the longest game,Ian Rogers,2010-05-07,01:07:26 IST,"Going into the final stages of his World Championship match against Veselin Topalov in Sofia, Bulgaria, World champion Viswanathan Anand took radical measures to try to break the deadlock but after a six and a half hour struggle he could manage only a draw after the longest and most complicated game of the match so far.The match remains tied at 4.5-4.5 with only three games remaining.Anand had his opponent's king trapped on the back rank but with his last move before the time control on move 40 and with just three minutes thinking time left, Anand missed a chance to decide the game.After allowing Topalov's king to escape, it seemed that the World champion's winning chances had evaporated.Now both players began to press for victory, Topalov's queen and running pawns fighting against Anand's active pieces.Anand was gaining the upper hand but he was also running terribly short of time, with 10 moves to complete in only seven minutes to avoid a time forfeit.He reached the move 60 time control and was out of danger of defeat, but the win still required extraordinary technique at a new time limit of 15 minutes plus 30 seconds per move for the remainder of the game. Eventually Anand erred and the game became completely random, with victory possible for either player.Anand had an additional obstacle to overcome on Thursday as, while he was contemplating his 20th move, an electrical fault caused the lighting above the board to flash on and off, and then the main light failed completely.Rather than stop the game timers, as the arbiter had done during the complete blackout in game five, Anand's clock continued ticking as he tried to maintain his concentration and find an effective plan.Fortunately, only three minutes later full-strength lighting returned and Anand almost immediately gave away his queen for two lesser pieces.Anand handled the resulting position with aplomb. However the game of the match continued, with the winner being hot favourite to take the world title. However, the deadlock remained intact.The tenth game will be played on Friday.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/Anand-fails-to-break-the-deadlock-after-the-longest-game/article16298913.ece

1176,Jankovic crushes Venus to bury sister showdown,DPA,2010-05-07,14:56:07 IST,"Jelena Jankovic
  Two-time champion Jelena Jankovic bared her claws with a monumental 6-0, 6-1 thrashing of Venus Williams to bury any dream of an all-Williams semifinal at the Internazionale d’Italia.Top-seed Serena Williams had earlier won her 10th match in a row to do her part to set up a possible sister clash, earning a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Russian Maria Kirilenko.But elder sister Venus was humbled in 59 minutes by Serb Jankovic.The loss was the most comprehensive in Williams’ career — 16 years as a professional — with the US player unable to make any effort in the face of the Jankovic tsunami on clay in humid and chilly night-time conditions.“I had so many tough matches against Venus,” said Jankovic, now 6- 5 in the series. “It’s great to win. This scoreline is unbelievable.When you play against a Williams you can’t relax. You have to go out there and give it your best.” Former French Open champion and number one Ana Ivanovic may be finally turning the corner on a long and frustrating slump measured in months rather than weeks.The Serb upset 14th-seed Nadia Petrova of Russia 6-2, 7-5 for only her third top-10 win since November 2008. Number 59 Ivanovic has also beaten ninth seed Victoria Azarenka and Russian Elena Dementieva this week.“I’ve been feeling really good on court for a couple of weeks now, and I really felt it could happen any week,” said Ivanovic. “I just needed to get some more momentum and start playing matches. That’s what I’ve been lacking for so long. To have these wins here means a lot.”Spain’s Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez put out Czech Lucie Safarova 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 in an unseeded match-up at the Foro Italico interrupted briefly by a rainstorm.Martinez Sanchez avoided a letdown after knocking out Danish second seed Caroline Wozniacki on Thursday on the Roman clay.Serena Williams is playing her first event since winning the Australian Open three months ago, blaming a left knee injury for keeping her off court.Williams sent down seven aces and broke serve four times in a 78-minute contest against the first-time quarterfinalist in Rome.Williams has beaten Kirilenko in all three of their matches, last in 2006.But the winner can’t understand how she’s done so well after her long pause: “I can’t believe I’m still in the tournament. It’s weird.”",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/Jankovic-crushes-Venus-to-bury-sister-showdown/article16299031.ece
1177,The technology helper: Mobile apps for your smartphone,DPA,2010-05-07,19:20:16 IST,"A BlackBerry Storm smartphone displayed at Best Buy in Mountain View, California.
  As more people are performing computing chores on their mobile phones, the search for useful apps is on.E-mail is usually covered adequately by smartphones, but how about instant messaging, forum reading, better web browsing, and tweeting? No problem. Read on for some suggestions.
Q: I’m addicted to instant messaging on the computer, but my iPhone doesn’t seem to have the ability to tie in to my Yahoo instant message account. Is there a cell phone app that will work?A: If you use only Yahoo!, you can certainly do worse that downloading and installing Yahoo! for mobile. Just navigate to >http://mobile.yahoo.com and type in your phone number. Yahoo will message you a direct link to the application’s download site. Or you can type m.yahoo.com into your phone’s browser, and you’ll get the same thing. The Yahoo! app will give you access to the IM client as well as plenty of other Yahoo! services, including e-mail.If you need access to more than one instant messenger from your smartphone, though, try Beejive (
>http://www.beejive.com). This nifty little application can aggregate your IM account from multiple services, including Yahoo!, AIM, Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger, and more. Also available for BlackBerry, Beejive sports a very intuitive and easy-to-read interface, and with it, you’ll be able to keep track of multiple conversations from multiple services at once.
Q: I use my BlackBerry for everything except web browsing because the browser is so slow and hard to read. Is there a better browsing application I can use?A: The web browser in the BlackBerry phone is indeed lacking. But there are options. Your first stop should be to >http://m.opera.com on your BlackBerry browser. There, you’ll find Opera Mini, a free browser that does everything that the BlackBerry browser doesn’t.It’s fast, first of all. But just as important, it makes web sites easier to read on the mobile phone by including a zoom rectangle around the mouse cursor. You move the rectangle to an area of a web page that you’d like to read, and the Opera Mini browser zooms in quickly to allow you to read that portion of the web sites.Opera Mini works not just on the BlackBerry, by the way. Just about anyone with a web-connected smartphone should be able to install it.Firefox fans will be glad to know that their favourite browser is coming soon to mobile phones. Firefox Mobile (
>http://mzl.la/NQySZ) will include such features as borderless browsing, so that your browsing is unhindered by toolbars, status bars, menus, and the like.It will also be able to synch your bookmarks between your desktop and browser, and it will include “location aware” browsing, which will allow the browser to offer you maps or tell you about events based upon your current location. Right now Firefox Mobile is available only on the Nokia N9000, but ultimately it will be universally available.Keep in mind that if what you primarily do on your BlackBerry’s browser is go directly to Google to conduct a search, you may be happy with the free Google Mobile app. Google Mobile puts an easy-to-read mobile version of Google on your BlackBerry or other smartphone, and it also includes handy links to Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, and Buzz. Since it’s free and small, Google Mobile is worth a download. Point your phone’s browser to m.google.com to download it.
Q: I’m a web forum junkie, but browsing forums on my phone is painful, and creating threads and posting replies is next to impossible. Is there a better way?A: Yes. Tapatalk (
>http://www.tapatalk.com) has quickly gained popularity as a web forum reader, and for good reason. First, for those forums that have integrated the code necessary for them to become Tapatalk-enabled, it does away with the forums’ bulky web interface and puts the primary content — discussions — in a phone-friendly format. Reading topics becomes a simple matter of scrolling through the threads, and of course you can create new threads or respond to existing ones directly from your phone.Right now Tapatalk is available for iPhone, Android, Nokia, and — in beta — BlackBerry. Once installed, you can use the application to browse for forums by topic, sign up, and start talking.
Q: What are some good mobile applications for using Twitter from my mobile phone?A: The idea behind Twitter — to let followers know what you’re doing as you’re doing it — seems tailor-made for mobile phones. So there are dozens upon dozens of mobile phone apps that can tie in to your Twitter account. But perhaps the best place for you to start is with the official smartphone applications from Twitter itself.Twitter for BlackBerry is available directly from your smartphone through the App World application. TwitterBerry (
>http://bit.ly/3HKWSd) is another good choice. For iPhone, Twitter acquired the popular Tweetie application (
>http://bit.ly/LjStO).Once installed, any of these applications launch in a flash and let you make tweets as easily as you type a text message.Also, no matter, which smartphone you might use, don’t forget Google Buzz (
>http://www.google.com/buzz), which will tie in to your Twitter account and some other popular social networking sites, like Flickr.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/The-technology-helper-Mobile-apps-for-your-smartphone/article16299090.ece

1179,Downturn has slowed down child labour elimination: ILO,Aarti Dhar,2010-05-07,23:57:20 IST,"Amid growing concerns over the impact of the economic downturn, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has warned that efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labour have slowed down and called for a “re-energised” global campaign to end the practice.In its global report on child labour, the ILO said the global number of child labourers had declined from 222 million to 215 million, or 3 per cent, over the period 2004 to 2008, representing a “slowing down of the global pace of reduction.”It expressed concern over the possibility that the global economic crisis could “further brake” progress towards the goal of eliminating the worst forms of child labour by 2016.The report, ‘Accelerating action against Child Labour,' says the updated picture from 2006 onwards is one of “uneven” progress towards the goal of eliminating the worst forms of child labour by 2016. The report warned that if current trends continued the 2016 target would be missed.The good news is that the overall pattern of child labour reduction has been maintained: the more harmful the work and the more vulnerable the children involved, the faster the decline. However, a staggering 115 million are still exposed to hazardous work, a proxy often used for the worst forms of child labour.The report breaks down data by age and gender. Progress was greatest among children aged 5-14, where the number of child labourers fell by 10 per cent. The number of children in hazardous work in this age range fell by 31 per cent. Child labour among girls decreased considerably (by 15 million or 15 per cent). However, it increased among boys (by 8 million or 7 per cent). What's more, child labour among young people aged 15 to 17 increased by 20 per cent, from 52 million to 62 million.The report includes data aggregated by region. It shows, for example, that the Asia Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean continue to reduce child labour, while sub-Saharan Africa has witnessed an increase both in relative and absolute terms. This region also has the highest incidence of children working, with one in four children engaged in child labour.Among children aged 5 to 14 in employment, the Asia and the Pacific region experienced a considerable decrease, not only in absolute numbers but also in relative terms (a decline of 26 million from 122.3 million to 96.4 million and a 4 percentage point decrease in incidence). For the same age category, the number of children in employment also continued to decline in Latin America and the Caribbean, albeit at a slower rate. However, the number of children in employment was increasing in sub-Saharan Africa in relative as well as absolute terms in the age group of 5-14.While most child labour was concentrated in South Asia because of its large population, other ‘pockets' of child labour — often the hardest to reach “hidden” forms — could be found in most countries across the region. Therefore the critical fight against child labour had to be won in South Asia, where the greatest numbers of child labourers were to be found. Often it was the ‘poverty of policy' rather than poverty itself that kept the mass of children out of school and in child labour.More than 48 million children in Asia-Pacific were in hazardous work – in other words, 42 per cent of all the children engaged in child labour in this region were involved in such work. They accounted for 40 per cent of the world's total number of children in hazardous work.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Downturn-has-slowed-down-child-labour-elimination-ILO/article16299135.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao said: “The situation in Manipur is very serious and highly alarming. The law-and-order situation is deteriorating day by day, constitutional machinery has broken down and fundamental rights of the common man were violated under the Okram Ibobi Singh-led government. The Centre should immediately dismiss the State government.The BJP leader, however, backed the decision of the State government of not allowing the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah to visit his native village Somdal in Uhrul district of Manipur. “There was no problem in Mr. Muivah's visit. But his agenda of bifurcating Manipur is not acceptable to the people of Manipur and the BJP also,” he said.

1181,“Governors owe their allegiance to Constitution”,Legal Correspondent,2010-05-07,23:51:43 IST,"A Governor is not an agent or employee of the Union government who can be arbitrarily removed by the Centre during change of party in power, the Supreme Court held on Friday.A Constitution Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said: “the doctrine of pleasure [under Article 156 of the Constitution] is not a licence to act with unfettered discretion to act arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously. It does not dispense with the need for a cause for withdrawal of the pleasure. The withdrawal of pleasure cannot be at the sweet will, whim and fancy of the Authority, but can only be for valid reasons.”The Bench was disposing of a writ petition filed as a public interest litigation in the wake of the removal of the Governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa on July 2, 2004 by the then President of India on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.The Bench said:“In the early days of Indian democracy, the same political party was in power both at the Centre and the States. The position has changed with passage of time. Now different political parties, some national and some regional, are in power in the States. Further one single party may not be in power either in the Centre or in the State. Different parties with distinct ideologies may constitute a front, to form a government.“On account of emergence of coalition politics, many regional parties have started sharing power in the Centre. Many a time there may not even be a common programme, manifesto or agenda among the parties sharing power. As a result, the agenda or ideology of a political party in power in the State may not be in sync with the agenda or ideology of the political parties in the ruling coalition at the Centre, or may not be in sync with the agenda or ideology of some of the political parties in the ruling coalition at the Centre, but may be in sync with some other political parties forming part of the ruling coalition at the Centre.“Further, the compulsions of coalition politics may require the parties sharing power to frequently change their policies and agendas. In such a scenario of myriad policies, ideologies, agendas in the shifting sands of political coalitions, there is no question of the Union government having Governors who are in sync with its mandate and policies. Governors are not expected or required to implement the policies of the government or popular mandates. Their constitutional role is clearly defined and bears very limited political overtones.“Reputed elder statesmen, able administrators and eminent personalities, with maturity and experience are expected to be appointed as Governors. While some of them may come from a political background, once they are appointed as Governors, they owe their allegiance and loyalty to the Constitution and not to any political party and are required to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.“We, therefore, reject the contention of the respondents that Governors should be in “sync” with the policies of the Union government or should subscribe to the ideology of the party in power at the Centre. As the Governor is neither the employee nor the agent of the Union government, we also reject the contention that a Governor can be removed if the Union government or party in power loses ‘confidence' in him.”The Bench noted that persons of calibre, experience, and distinction “are chosen to fill these posts. Such persons are chosen not to enable them to earn their livelihood but to serve society. It is wrong to assume that such persons having been chosen on account of their stature, maturity and experience will be demoralised or be in constant fear of removal, unless there is security of tenure. The doctrine of pleasure is not a licence to act with unfettered discretion to act arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/ldquoGovernors-owe-their-allegiance-to-Constitutionrdquo/article16299132.ece
1182,"Governors can't be removed at Centre's whims, says Court",J. Venkatesan,2010-05-07,23:29:08 IST,"A view of the Supreme Court.
  | Photo Credit: The Hindu The Supreme Court on Friday held that a Governor cannot be removed on the ground that he/she is out of sync with the policies and ideologies of the Union government or the party in power at the Centre. Nor can he/she be removed on the ground that the Union government has lost confidence in him/her.A five-judge Constitution Bench, comprising Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justices S.H. Kapadia, R.V. Raveendran, B. Sudershan Reddy and P. Sathasivam was disposing of a petition filed by the former Member of Parliament, B.P. Singhal.The Bench said that as a Governor was neither an employee nor agent of the Union government, it was rejecting the contention that a Governor could be removed if the Union government or the party in power lost ‘confidence' in him.It held that a change in government at the Centre was not a ground for removal of Governors to make way for others favoured by the new government.Writing the judgment, Justice Raveendran said, “What Article 156 (1) of the Constitution [under which a Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President] dispenses with is the need to assign reasons or the need to give notice, but the need to act fairly and reasonably cannot be dispensed with by Article 156(1).”The Bench said:“The President, in exercising power under Article 156(1), should act in a manner that is not arbitrary or unreasonable. In the event of challenge of withdrawal of the pleasure, the court will necessarily assume that it is for compelling reasons. Consequently, where the aggrieved person is not able to establish a prima facie instance of arbitrariness or mala fides in his removal, the court will refuse to interfere.“However, where a prima facie case of arbitrariness or mala fides is made out, the court can require the Union government to produce records/material to satisfy itself that the withdrawal of pleasure was for good and compelling reasons.

1186,Law introduced in US to revoke citizenship of terror suspects,PTI,2010-05-07,09:39:10 IST,"Concerned over terror groups recruiting expatriates in the U.S. to launch attacks against the country, a group of lawmakers today introduced a legislation in the Congress that would allow the government to revoke the citizenship of people who attack the U.S. or its allies.The bipartisan legislation - Terrorism Expatriation Act - would also allow the State Department to revoke the citizenship of people who provide support to terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda.“Under the terrorist expatriation act, the State Department would be able to revoke the citizenship of an American who affiliates with a foreign terrorist organisation or who fights against our country,” Senator Joe Lieberman told a press conference at the Capitol Hill on Friday.Foreign terrorist organisations are also designated according to statute by the U.S. State Department.The legislation is being introduced in the context of the arrest of Faisal Shahzad, Pakistani-American, who has been charged of terrorist activities and plotting to explode a bomb at the Times Square last Saturday.Identical bills were introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.However, Lieberman said the legislation, when finally becomes a law, could not be applicable to Shahzad.“This proposal if adopted cannot apply to Faisal Shahzad because that would be the retroactive application of a law, which would not be appropriate or constitutional,” he said.Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee Lieberman said Shahzad is just the latest in a growing and accelerating line of cases where American citizens have supported or fought for al-Qaeda or affiliated terrorist organisations against the United States.“The facts are now clear. Over the past several years, the threat from Islamist terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda has changed. On 9/11, 19 terrorist who were trained abroad were sent here to carry out their attacks on America.Now, with increasing frequency, American citizens like Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood - the alleged Fort Hood killer of 13, Abdulhakim Mohammad, who killed a U.S. Army recruiter in Little Rock last June, and Faisal Shahzad, the accused Times Square terrorist, are inspired or recruited by violent,” he noted.Once the law is passed, if an American citizen travelled to Somalia to train and fight for the terrorist group al-Shabab, the State Department will have the authority to begin proceedings to revoke their citizenship so that they cannot return here on their passports to carry out an attack against Americans, Liberman said.“If in some way they do and are then captured, they will not enjoy the rights and privileges of American citizenship in the legal proceedings against them. That, I think, will make America safer,” Lieberman said.“The law would also make it easier to pursue and prosecute individuals like Adam Gadahn, the aforementioned al Qaeda-American spokesman, by military commission. Gadahn famously destroyed his US passport in a jihadist recruiting video in what was obviously an indication that he wanted to renounce his citizenship.This bill only updates an existing statute that has been on the books for 70 years to account for the terrorist enemy that the U.S. is fighting today.Senator Scott Brown said al Qaeda and foreign terrorist organizations have a long-standing strategy to recruit U.S. citizens, and to train them in a foreign country, and then send them back to try to kill Americans and anyone visiting our country.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Law-introduced-in-US-to-revoke-citizenship-of-terror-suspects/article16299005.ece

1190,Will not allow Congress to benefit in Jharkhand: Gadkari,Prakash Kamat,2010-05-07,00:30:59 IST,"Nitin Gadkari
  Bharatiya Janata Party president Nitin Gadkari on Thursday declined to say if the party will press for a change in Jharkhand chief ministership. “I would say, wait and watch,” he said.At a press conference here, he said, “I will be going to Jharkhand tomorrow [Friday] and will meet all those related to the issue.”The BJP would take all steps to ensure that the Congress did not benefit from the impasse in the State. “We will ensure that the Congress does not benefit from the Jharkhand situation by breaking smaller parties with money and muscle power,” he said.Jharkhand plunged into a political crisis after Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Shibu Soren voted in favour of the United Progressive Alliance government on a cut motion moved by the BJP in the Lok Sabha on April 27. A day after the cut motion, the BJP's parliamentary board decided to withdraw the party's support to the Soren-led government, only to later put its decision on hold and instead ask Mr. Soren to quit and mobilise the JMM's support in favour of the BJP.
Nationwide agitation
Mr. Gadkari said the BJP would launch a nationwide agitation on May 12 against “the misuse of the CBI by the United Progressive alliance (UPA) government to blackmail and threaten Opposition leaders.”“BJP workers will protest outside the CBI offices in all State capitals against the large-scale misuse. We demand this misuse be stopped immediately. We will also raise this issue in the Parliament,” he said.He, however, declined to comment when asked to respond to the action taken against media portal Tehelka.com when the National Democratic Alliance was in power. “I cannot say anything about that now. But all I can say is there was no misuse of the CBI during the NDA regime,” he said.He also accused the CBI of specifically harassing the Gujarat government and its police officers over the issue of fake shoot-outs.The CBI was also used to pressure vulnerable Opposition leaders, particularly those belonging to the BJP, SP and the RJD and harassing those Opposition leaders who were not vulnerable to government pressure, he alleged.He said he had worked out a strategy to enhance the party's vote bank by 10 per cent till the next Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by reaching out to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, minorities and unorganised labour in a big way. The party would set up a “think tank” to work on the strategy.Mr. Gadkari is on a two-day visit to Goa.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/Will-not-allow-Congress-to-benefit-in-Jharkhand-Gadkari/article16299079.ece

Photo: Nissar Ahmad
  | Photo Credit: NISSAR AHMAD The Kashmir Valley erupted in a spontaneous celebration on Thursday after the news that Shah Faesal, a medical graduate from a remote village in Kupwara, had topped this year's Civil Services Examination.Faesal's journey to the topmost job in the country was seen as an achievement for the youth managed to crack the prestigious examination despite some recent traumatic experiences.Seen as recognition of the Kashmiri talent, Faesal is the first Kashmiri Muslim to top the All India Services.As Faesal was in Delhi, his temporary residence in Srinagar and ancestral home in Sogam village suddenly found themselves thrust in the limelight.“We never imagined that Faesal would achieve such a thing. The phones have not stopped ringing,” said family friend Abdul Majid Pir.Faesal's mother Mubeena, a government school teacher, is overwhelmed. After the killing of his father Ghulam Rasool Shah by militants in 2002, the first test Faesal faced was appearing for the Professional Entrance Examination for MBBS.“He was disturbed, but he went ahead and was selected,” said Mubeena, tears of joy sparkling in her eyes. “I did not put any restrictions on him and whatever he wanted to do, he went ahead and did it,” said the proud mother.After the death of Faesal's father, a respected teacher in the area, the family, including a sister and a brother, shifted to Srinagar. However, the incident did not affect Faesal's resolve to achieve his goal.People from all walks of life visited Faesal's home to congratulate his family for a feat that has “made every Kashmiri proud.”In Sogam, people celebrated by bursting crackers.
“Remarkable feat”
Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said it was a remarkable achievement. “Wherever Kashmiris have worked, they have excelled. I am proud of Faesal, who hails from a remote village. He has worked so hard and made us real proud,” he told The Hindu, adding that Kashmiri talent was unmatched.The former Chief Minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and People's Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti congratulated Faesal.In a joint statement issued here on Thursday, the PDP leaders also said that the youth from the remotest Lolab area of the Kupwara district proved his capability by securing the first position in the country. They said Faesal's achievement also proved the intellectual potential of the youth of Jammu and Kashmir and that his success would give inspiration to youth of the State.Youth National Conference president Qaisar Jamsheed Lone and MLA Lolab Abdul Haque Khan were among others who congratulated Faesal.
After a 16-year gap

1193,Hunger for humour,Rana Siddiqui Zaman,2010-05-07,20:23:07 IST,"Rakesh Bedi
  If they said laughter is the closest distance between two people, they certainly had people like Rakesh Bedi in mind. If his very name brings a smile to one's face, a chat with him fills you with laughter. Just like in reel life through various films and television serials where he had us in splits, he lives up to his roles in real life too.So, this graduate of Bhagat Singh College, Delhi University, begins with why he just couldn't become the engineer his technocrat father posted at the Australian Embassy wanted him to be.“On my father's insistence, I went to take the entrance test of IIT-Delhi. The test paper contained 13 questions with three parts each. I knew only one answer. The paper started at 9 a.m. I wrote that one answer and submitted the paper at 9.05 a.m. The examiner got the shock of his life. Wide-eyed, he asked, ‘Are you sure you have done the answers?' I replied, ‘Actually, I have come to the wrong address,' and left the exam hall!”Next, the actor tried Biology. “But the cockroaches on the table to be dissected sent shivers down my spine. I ran away from there too,” he recalls.During his school days at DPS Mathura Road, Delhi, and Kendriya Vidyalaya, Bedi was active in theatre. In 1972-73 he formed his own theatre group, called Ankur Arts, in Delhi. He reminisces, “Those were the days. With little money in hand, we used to produce, direct, write and market our own plays. Khud hi ja kar poster chipkate the aur theatre book karte the.”His love for acting made Bedi join the Film and Television Institute of India, , Pune. “My father wasn't angry as he knew this was the only thing I could do. Moreover, we were also an artistically-inclined family, as my maternal grandfather used to act in films and his co-stars used to be those days' big actors, like Ram Kumar and Chaman Lal. Since I inherited acting, there was not much bother in the family about my choice of career,” he says.Lessons in acting from an established institute, Bedi says, help you reach your goal faster. “If you know the technicality, you reach your goal faster, otherwise you beat around the bush. You set your own parameters any way.”After the course, Bedi knew exactly what he wanted to do — comedy. And in his debut in Saeed Mirza's film Diploma, he played the lead role of a comedian.“That was it. Those who saw it insisted that I must do comedy only. And I also think that if I tell you a joke and you laugh at it instantly, my job is done. I don't believe in the bifurcation of humour into white or black comedy. I think those who cannot make others laugh say it had black humour, or those who don't understand comedy say it was black humour. Plays like Tajmahal ka Tender and Massage, of which I have done over 100 shows, certainly have black humour, because they expose the system, but while I acted in them my sole aim remained to make you laugh instantly. Then you go home and think whether it was black or white or slapstick humour. You see Charlie Chaplin films. They have pathos but they primarily make you laugh, and that's why they are successful too”.The film Diploma brought him the famous serial Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi on Doordarshan. It also opened more doors in the film world, where he again preferred comic roles.“It's not that I didn't get serious roles or I couldn't do them. My bent of mind is such. By nature I am naughty. Main thoda shararti hoon and that's why even if I get into a tense situation, I prefer to wriggle out of it soon, even at the cost of belittling myself. For instance, if I have hurt someone and the situation has become tense, I prefer saying sorry even if it hurts my ego. That way, I know that at least I will be relaxed,” Bedi avers.With this easygoing temperament, Bedi has made great friends in stalwarts like Rajkumar, Sanjeev Kumar and Dharmendra. He recalls, “I have done some five films with Rajkumar and shared a great rapport with him. While working on the sets of Bulandi, I heard that my mother had passed away and I had to rush to Delhi for her last rites. The next day the producer was standing at my doorstep; he had come to take me back. With a heavy heart when I reached the sets, Rajkumar held my hand and took me for a long walk. He told me, ‘Once even I had to come for work when my brother died. If you hadn't come, the producer would suffermajor financial loss. We have to be professional actors and I am not responsible for calling you back.” With these words he put me in the right frame of mind.”Bedi has consciously stayed away from daily soap operas on TV. He says, “I am the only actor who has been regular on television without daily soaps for over 27 years. I can't work in serials where I have to stand in a corner for ages and execute only one emotion,” he laughs.But doing comedy in Hindi films hasn't made him happy either. “If there are lesser comedians or fewer comedy roles, actors can't be blamed. It is the fault of filmmakers.” He feels comedy gets pushed to the background during scriptwriting. “Comedy is only added later to bring some laughs. It always gets step-brotherly treatment in films.”That's why Bedi, a father of two children aged 23 and 19, has been active in theatre for several years. Few know that he is a poet too. And the poet in him sees the serious side of life. Sample this:
Tadbeer se zamane ki taqdeer ko badloon

Gar tera sath ho to tasveer ko badloon

Badal gaya zamana yar ab tu bhi to badal
Ya phir panditon or peer ko badloon?

  My workout regimen is a combination of gym and yoga. I go to the gym four times a week. I have reduced my cardio, and I do more of strength training.So my workout includes a lot of spinning and stretching. The reason why I do less of cardio and more of strength training is because of lack of time. I also like doing yoga and I practise it once a week.I do not follow a particular diet as such, though I definitely watch what I eat, because more than dieting it is important to eat healthy. Fortunately, I am not a foodie so I don't get tempted very often. I try not to eat fried and heavy food like paranthas and sweets very often.Other than working out, it is very important to have a healthy lifestyle. One must have a balanced routine. Sleep on time and wake up on time and make sure you get adequate rest.For girls, one should avoid using too much make-up, as it spoils the skin. Even if you do, make sure you take it off before you go to bed.And use as much natural stuff as possible, like cucumbers and tomatoes.

  | Photo Credit: Rajeev Bhatt If you want to catch hold of NIFT students on a break, you have one hour to do so, between noon and 1 p.m., Monday to Friday. There's not much time before classes resume, so chances are, all of them will be on campus or, at the most, across the road, over at Subhash's stall.The NIFT campus at Hauz Khas is a pretty one — cool corridors, brightly-painted canteen and amphitheatre (or ‘kund' as the students call it). The ‘kund' is obviously empty, the sun infusing it with the torturous blaze of a Roman coliseum at daytime. In the foyer, some students are putting finishing touches to projects they have to submit for ‘jury' appraisal. The amphitheatre isn't usually that sparse, we are informed, with cricket matches and ‘kavi sammelans' keeping it occupied on some evenings. That's also where the students have their fashion shows.
What's not to be
The one-hour break, which also means classes are taken seriously. “Since the break is short, even if students leave the campus, you'll find them on the other side of the road,” says Radhika with friends Palki and Aditi, while a colourful hand-painted umbrella does the rounds.
Alternatives
There's another unlikely place that comes up frequently during conversations with students. “Washrooms!” grins Neeji Bansal, a first year student of leather designing, out for lunch at the canteen with friends. “We sometimes also get breaks in-between classes,” says someone from the group. “Depends on the teacher,” drawls one more. The canteen, with its menu of dal-chawal and select Chinese, remains packed, with fried-rice Manchurian ranking higher than the rest. There's a Nescafe outlet too not far away.Close by, a bunch of hassled-looking second-year Fashion Communication students — Ishani, Harleen and Richa — are hanging out in the foyer. “We eat and we sleep,” they say about their break-time activity. “We talk in the library too,” they say about other ways of catching up.Students get together outside campus too. There's a Café Coffee Day outlet nearby and a Nirula's not too far off.“We also hang out at Select CityWalk because we usually have assignments in malls,” say some.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Swift-breaks-in-NIFT/article16299101.ece
1196,How to make…Grilled tandoori-flavoured prawns,Nisha Susan Mani,2010-05-07,17:53:07 IST,"Grilled tandoori prawns
  | Photo Credit: special arrangement 
What you need
King prawns (de-veined and cleaned): 250 gm
To marinate:
Yogurt: two tbspGinger paste: one tbspGarlic paste: one tbspLime juice: one tbspKashmiri chilli powder: one tspCumin powder: half tspCoriander powder: one tspTandoori masala: one tbsp (If you have this, omit coriander and cumin powder)Salt if requiredWooden skewers (soaked in water): 6 to 8Oil: enough to grease the griddle pan/ grillFresh lime: one wedge
Cooking instructions
Mix all the ingredients together and marinate the prawns. Keep aside for 10 minutes (if you have time, otherwise you can skip to the next step).Thread on the skewers (about six on each), oil the pan and once it is hot, place the prawn skewers in batches (if required) on to the grill. If you are using an electric grill, it cooks much faster, but be careful not to burn them. If you are doing it in a frying pan over fire, cook each side for three to four minutes. If it is on a barbecue grill, it could take a little longer, but you need to remember that prawns when over cooked, turn hard. It should retain its nice juicy texture. Squeeze some lime on top and serve hot along with some mint-coriander yogurt chutney.
On a day you crave for something spicy and something in a jiffy, these tandoori flavoured prawns come to your rescue. It's made its way through many a barbecue sessions at home and my mom, Jaga, even though not a huge fan of seafood, makes this excellent tandoori prawns in under 15 minutes.

Creative, determined, driven defiance. That's what creates menus such as Noma's: baby carrots served on an edible “soil” of malt, hazelnuts and beer. Featuring raw materials such as horse mussels, unripe elderberries and seaweed, all foraged from the region. A menu so dependent on sourcing the best produce possible, it even insists on curd from Iceland.Today's well-travelled, and admittedly spoilt, diners desire the unusual. At the same time, in these days of instability — whether we're talking politics, environment or finance — people crave connections to the past, the earth and tradition. The chefs who reach the top are the ones who manage to pull this all off.Competition is fierce. Fortunately, there's no dearth of talent.This list of the world's best restaurants, which generates reams of conversation and controversy every year, is published in conjunction with trade magazine, Restaurant to track dining trends. Drawn up by a jury of 800 of the world's most celebrated chefs, food writers and opinion makers, this year's list introduces a wave of young rock star chefs. All unapologetically breaking traditional rules of gastronomy. This includes Iñaki Aizpitarte, changing French fine dining with his Parisian bistro, Le Chateaubriand, which has risen to number 11, complete with its chalk boards and hard wooden chairs. Biko, in Mexico, is hip in a completely different way with its club atmosphere and signature foie 100 per cent candy, foie gras topped by a cloud of cotton candy and sherry vinegar.In an e-mail interview with MetroPlus, Nathan Garnett, director of the San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants list, explains why this exercise expresses global dining trends so comprehensively. “This highlights who is doing something important, culinary hotspots, restaurant designs that have captured the imagination and so on. For chefs it's a great opportunity to express respect or admiration for fellow chefs...”He adds that since food is subjective, the process of putting this list together is a lot of “fun”. “It creates a huge debate each year and that is precisely why we do it, to get people talking about what does make a great restaurant… A beach cafe on Bondi beach, or an Indian restaurant on the streets of Birmingham in the U.K. can all garner a vote if someone feels compelled enough to do so.”Stating that he's managed to try only a few of the restaurants on the list so far (“although I am working on that!”) Garnett says he likes all types of restaurant experiences. “I recently dined at the Fat Duck and it was incredible — I loved the story telling behind each dish and the fact that they transport you away to another time or place. Equally, I have dined at Momofuku Ssam Bar in the last 12 months and enjoyed the no-nonsense fun, experimentation, and local produce.”Asia is gradually making an impact on the list. Garnett says they have a significant proportion of the Academy based in Asia, voting and judging the region's restaurants. Iggys in Singapore, the first Asian restaurant to break in, has climbed to number 28. Jaan par Andre from Singapore, is at Number 39.It's about more than just great food. A great restaurant is about the whole experience. “The definition of a great restaurant will vary from person to person,” says Garnett, “I believe the ultimate test is the memories you are left with.”",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/And-the-winner-is%E2%80%A6/article11638807.ece

  Ramesh Krishnan doesn't remember a time when he didn't play tennis. Literally.“I've been around tennis courts with a racquet in hand for as long as I can remember,” he laughs. “There was a clay court in our garden, where my father learnt to play, and I'm sure I came out there as a toddler and hit some balls!”It came from being part of a large tennis-loving family, he says, where there was almost always a tennis game on, and never a dearth of players.“My grandfather T.K. Ramanathan was very keen on tennis and he made sure we all played,” Ramesh recalls. “Even back in the Sixties, the ladies in our family — my aunt and my mother — used to play, and there was always someone to play with. Our whole lives revolved around a tennis court.”Of course, it went without saying that the toddler who played in the backyard would eventually follow in the footsteps of his father, tennis legend Ramanathan Krishnan.“It was my grandfather's dream, and I never really gave any other career a thought,” he says simply. “By the time I was in high school, I was representing India in the Davis Cup, so my education was geared towards that. I don't know what I would have ventured into if not tennis!”And follow he did, chalking up a stellar career in juniors just like his father — he was ranked No. 1 in the world and won both the junior Wimbledon and French Open titles — and then building a solid career on the main tour (he was ranked as high as No. 23 in the world), featuring in some memorable matches at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and, of course, in the Davis Cup.“The Davis Cup matches always stand out — we reached the final in 1987 and the semi-final in 1993. And, reaching the quarter-finals at the U.S. Open [1981 and 1987] and Wimbledon [1986] is something I look back fondly on,” he says. “Both the Davis Cup and Wimbledon always meant a little extra to me.”In a career spanning three decades (1977 to 1993), he won a reputation not only for having a beautiful game, all amazing angles and volleys, but also for being a gentleman on and off the court.“The bulk of players from India were well behaved — I think our society demands that,” he says, unassumingly. “You were expected to carry yourself a certain way in public.”When it came time to retire in 1993, Ramesh was quite content to hang up his racquet , professionally speaking. It gave him more time to focus on that other core passion of his life — family.“My children had started school and they couldn't travel with me as much,” he says. “Suddenly I wasn't that excited anymore about boarding a plane and travelling leaving my family behind.”Fittingly, his family remains tennis-crazy, with both his daughters, Gayatri and Nandita, playing tennis, first in juniors' tournaments, and now for their respective universities in the U.S.Travelling with his daughters to juniors' tournaments as his parents did with him decades ago, Ramesh had come full circle — and discovered it wasn't easy. “There were times when Gayatri was playing and I knew her opponent was not being fair to her, but I had to detach myself — it's a whole new experience as a parent,” he says ruefully. “It's like being on the rollercoaster all over again… but, this time, I had no control over what was happening!”Today, sitting in the garden that once housed the clay court he played on, Ramesh exudes calm contentment. His days are spent caring for the Krishnan Tennis Centre (“a place to come play tennis and get some exercise”), the Indane Gas supply service his father started in 1963 (“he played in the amateur era and needed a livelihood”) and his daughters (“helping them achieve what they want to.”)He still plays tennis socially almost every day of the week, but says his role in the future of Indian tennis is just that of ‘cheerleader' — “I'm happy to root for people who're doing well,” he smiles.Tennis has been his life and his education, and that, for Ramesh, is enough: “It gave me a chance to grow as a person. I've had all these amazing experiences, and I have tennis to thank for it,” he says.
SERVE AND VOLLEY

Pitted against the best: I consider Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras the most outstanding players I ever faced – Borg in the early part of my career in the 70s, and Sampras towards the end of my career in the 90s, just as he was starting out.
Toughest opponent: I always found Ivan Lendl very tough to play. His style of play just didn't suit me – I couldn't serve big enough to unsettle him and he was a bit too overpowering. He was a nightmare for many players to face, and I was one of them!

1201,A new way to fitness,IANS,2010-05-07,17:04:35 IST,"To eat or not depends on your blood type Photo: AP
  | Photo Credit: PAUL SAKUMA After hitting the gym, doing yoga and jogging, people are now trying blood group-based diets, popular in the West. Experts say the secret to a fit body may be hidden in the blood type, and these diets are finding a foothold in India.Explaining how such diets work, Ekta Tandon, dietician at dailydiet.in, says a chemical reaction occurs between your blood and foods as they are digested.“Lectins, a diverse and abundant protein found in food, may be incompatible with your blood group. I recommend that one follow a blood group diet along with regular food to provide the body with all nutrients,” she adds. American naturopaths James D'Adamo and his son Peter D'Adamo, founder of blood group-based diets, feel each person's blood group is the key to how he/she burns calories. Also, it decides what food they should eat and how they benefit from a certain type of exercise.“People with A blood type have a different set of characteristics from people who are Type O — they are susceptible to different diseases, should eat different foods and exercise differently,” says Peter on their website www.dadamo.com.The blood group diet chart suggests that ‘Type O' people should eat high proteins; ‘Type A' should avoid heavy proteins and dig on carbohydrates; ‘Type B' people should drink more milk and avoid fruits such as corns, lentils and peanuts.People with the rare Type AB blood group can go for a combination of the diet recommended for Type A and Type B.“In the three months that I have been on a diet, I have lost almost five kg. So far, everything is good,” says Akankasha Darswal, who is a Type A.“The only difficulty was eating more carbohydrates. I was a bit sceptical, because we all believe that we should avoid carbohydrates to lose weight, but the results are there to see,” she adds.However, Tandon says that one should not overdo this diet. Also, it is important to consult a professional and factor in your age into the programme.”Food and exercise go hand in hand — eat well and exercise well to stay fit. But, the diet has its critics. “I don't recommend that my clients go on such a diet, and have never seen a particular diet showing the same results on those with the of the same blood group,” says Sonia Narang, a senior dietician.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/A-new-way-to-fitness/article16299056.ece

  | Photo Credit: NAGARA GOPAL ‘All the world's a stage' said Shakespeare… “I would love to carry the world with me,” is how Rammohan Holagundi, theatre personality, would end it. From a struggling start in streets, to forming Nishumbita, a theatre group with more than 100 registered members, Ram has come a long way.Years back when he was scripting the ‘acts of life' beating the dappu to spread awareness on family planning with his small group, he didn't realise the potential of theatre. “As a tool for spreading the message among people, it is a very powerful medium,” he says.Since childhood it has been Ram's dream to do something for the society and when he became a student of theatre, he realised that the tool to fight the ills of society was finally in his hands. It's been 21 years since then, now Ram uses theatre to help children find their creative instincts. His recent production was a play based on folk tales from different parts of the country and he is also preparing his little actors for the theatre fest to be held in Kolkata.“In a class of 60, around 40 children want to take up theatre, this goes to reflect the interest levels among children,” says Ram who teaches acting as a subject in different schools in the city. While kids look interested, the real task for Ram lies in encouraging the parents to let their children join theatre classes. “Parents somehow feel other subjects like computers science will make their child's future. Then I have to cite examples of software professionals and bureaucrats who do theatre despite being what they are,” shrugs Ram.Unlike most actors or directors, theatre wasn't something that Ram chanced upon. Though he began with painting, he and his brother as school kids had created an unofficial theatre group of St. Patrick School and represented the school in YMCA competitions. They won most of the awards and that meant the unofficial theatre group getting discovered by the school authorities. “Our Principal congratulated us and encouraged us to participate in such events ‘officially,”' smiles Ram.After that encouragement, theatre remained with the two brothers. Despite pursuing science and applying for CDS, Ram went on to do a PG Diploma in acting on his brother's suggestion, after which he did his MA in performing arts and won a gold medal. “During this time, I was assisting a friend for an acting workshop in school. I was supposed to be there in the evening, but after the first day, I was there from the morning. I was thrilled and excited about working with children and then the school offered me the job of part-time drama teacher,” he recollects.With the completion of his course and his coming in contact with young kids from slums in and around Charminar in the Old City to form the Koshish Theatre Group, he begun his crusade.From then on, theatre became his weapon and he started performing street plays on various aspects like communal harmony, national integration, girl child, child labour, education, AIDS, nutritional problems, environmental problems (including pollution, deforestation), water harvesting and lots more to bring awareness among the people.Besides acting, directing and teaching, there is another ‘part' which he plays. After completion of his standard X, he had joined Torn Curtains as a production assistant. “Here I did everything from moping, creating background props, painting, getting water and refreshments for all. I loved every bit of my time spent with the team. It was an enriching experience,” he says.So which part of Ram — actor, director or teacher is the real him? “All aspects. Kids at school teach you everyday. As a teacher I only assist them, like my Principal I encourage them to come up with suggestions and thoughts on a particular scene or story. I don't teach them dialogue delivery and facial expression, it comes naturally to them. My students are all rounders; they know everything from backstage management to costume designing. And when it comes to giving names they are experts,” he laughs.Ram also had the opportunity to teach special kids, “Their intelligence and enthusiasm encourages me at every step. And they have nicknamed me Gundu,” he laughs.Ram is now assisted by his wife Sowmya, brother and sister-in-law at Nishumbita and he says “I am very fortunate to have a supporting family.”Till date Nishumbita Theatre Group has staged over 60 plays.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Getting-his-lsquoactrsquo-together/article16299054.ece

  Nearly 90 per cent of the world's adult population consumes caffeine daily. Next to water, coffee and tea are the most widely consumed drinks in the world. Children take caffeine mostly in the form of chocolates, ice cream and caffeinated soft drinks. Coffee and tea contain several compounds that may have both beneficial and adverse health effects: caffeine and antioxidants (eg, polyphenols, catechins, and flavonoids). The following is a brief overview of these effects.
Neuropsychiatric effects: As anyone cramming all night for an exam or working a night shift knows, caffeine increases alertness and energy, and improves attention, mood, psychomotor performance, and working memory.Sixty five mg of caffeine (150 ml of instant coffee) has a modest painkilling effect in tension and migraine headaches. In fact, many OTC medications for migraine contain large doses of caffeine. On the other hand, chronic caffeine consumption may be associated with headache - which is also a symptom of caffeine withdrawal!Long-term caffeine use has a mild protective effect against Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease.Taking more than five cups of coffee/day can cause anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, irritability, and even panic attacks.
Heart effects: Taking up to three cups of coffee per day may protect against myocardial infarction. In susceptible individuals, heavy coffee use can trigger heart rhythm abnormalities and other cardiac disorders. Contrary to popular opinion, caffeine has little or no effect on blood pressure in habitual coffee drinkers, nor does it increase the risk of hypertension.
Endocrine and gastrointestinal effects: Taking coffee or tea reduces the risk of developing type-2 diabetes mellitus. Among alcoholics, caffeine reduces the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver. Caffeine is a potent stimulator of the intestines and helps prevent constipation.
Cancer: Although population studies suggest that intake of green tea may prevent several cancers, hard evidence from prospective studies is lacking. Randomized studies on caffeinated drinks and cancer are difficult to do because most cancers have a long latency period.
Musculoskeletal effects: In women with low calcium intake, caffeinated drinks increase the risk of osteoporosis. Among athletes, caffeine improves performance across a wide range of physical activities. The International Olympic Committee prohibits urinary caffeine concentrations of more than 12 mcg/ml. To stay within the legal limit, athletes should limit their intake of coffee to two to three cups per day (or the equivalent intake for other forms of caffeine).

  | Photo Credit: THE HINDU “Ichi, ni, san, shi, go…” the scream startled me as I drew close to Kofukan Shito Ryu Karate School . The master, G.S.Suresh came to my rescue just when I was wondering what those words meant.“It is simple counting in Japanese,” he smiled. The force with each of those numbers were pronounced fascinated me and I too joined the trainees instantly.“Karate is a Japanese martial art of self defence. It is necessarily not about protecting yourself when left in the lurch. Rather we concentrate to improve presence of mind. It is about how quick you respond to a situation. Karate helps in optimising this power in the body. In due course, blood circulation improves and mind gets relaxed increasing the fitness levels. As a result, even under trying circumstances you don’t panic and are able to take correct decisions,” Mr. Suresh elaborates.Impressed by his briefing, I take on. Broadly categorised as exercises for beginners, there are simple techniques for those in the next level and advanced techniques for those with two years experience. The class began with the callisthenics, partially warm-up and cool-down, that prepares the body for the strenuous fight-outs or sparring.It started with eye ball rotation to strengthen the optic nerve and improve blood circulation in the eye followed by neck, shoulder, hip and hand rotations. Push ups were a bit difficult for me as I had to do the drill with knuckles and fingers. Next was a series of sit ups to strengthen abdomen, thigh and calf muscles. Though I was at ease in raising the leg and skipping, I found the set of drills with toes a tough proposition. Pressing the toes down I had to lift my body followed by frog jump and duck walk. With that ended the first level exercises.“Once you are through with these drills, your confidence improves and now you are ready to face sterner tests and strenuous routines,” the master continued.Next on the list were punches, blocks and kicks. There were middle, upper, lower and double punches and middle, upper, lower and outer blocks. The kicks involved front, slap, side, scissor kick, jump kick and leg block. Definitely it was not easy for me, as for most of the session I was watching karatekas doing some sparring to perfect the technique.“All these kicks, punches and blocks serve as good stretch exercises to tone your muscles well. Moreover these drills help gain full control over the body and improve reflexes. In general, karate is a whole body exercise which prunes physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual abilities. In short it develops a positive mentality,” Mr. Suresh explained.For more details dial 9788692808 for Mr. Suresh",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/A-punch-here-and-a-kick-there/article16299080.ece

A record 22 Asian women stood in this election for all three main parties. Until now no Asian women have ever been elected as MPs.The first male Asian MP, the Indian Dadabhai Naoroji, was elected in 1892 for Finsbury in central London. Mohammad Sarwar became the U.K.'s first Muslim MP after winning Glasgow Central in 1997. Sayeeda Warsi became the first Muslim woman to sit on the front bench for the Conservatives in 2007 — as a baroness (member of the House of Lords) rather than as an MP.An Oxford University graduate and barrister, Ms. Mahmood is the daughter of the Birmingham Labour party's chairman and stood against another woman Asian candidate for the Conservatives, Nusrat Ghani. Her selection caused consternation among local activists but was fiercely backed by party chiefs.Speaking last month, Ms. Mahmood stressed that Muslim women were interested in politics and her candidacy showed that a role in the Commons was open to all ethnic minorities.“The image of the voiceless Muslim woman who cannot leave the house is just not true, they are interested in politics. Parliament is for the people — all of the people — and the ethnic minority population should claim it.” Ms. Mahmood said she had also faced fears that she would not be accepted by the Asian community.Ms. Qureshi (46), a Pakistan-born barrister, moved to the U.K. when she was nine. She advised the former London Mayor, Ken Livingstone, on human rights. She has also previously headed the criminal legal section of the U.N.

  Asking the UCPN (Maoist) to forge consensus among political parties and withdraw the indefinite strike, a massive peace assembly was held in Kathmandu on Friday.In a late development, the Maoists withdrew the indefinite general strike they called on Sunday. The withdrawal comes after the party faced immense pressure from all sectors.Earlier, speakers at the peace assembly, attended by thousands of people, said they did not elect leaders to trouble the citizens, but to respect their feelings. The speakers asked political parties to come to an agreement in two days' time and ease the situation. The assembly was attended by doctors, engineers, celebrities, lawyers, teachers, students, engineers, journalists and the common people. Most people were dressed in white, carried the national flag and held placards with messages like “stop the bandh” and “we want peace.”However, as the strike entered the sixth day, senior Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai said his party would rather change the nature of the protest now than withdraw it. On the other hand, the major coalition partner of the CPN (UML)-led government maintained that there can be no change in the government through the pressure created by the Maoists.The United Nations and its humanitarian partners have expressed concern about the problems created by the prolonged strike in this donor-dependent country.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Massive-peace-assembly-amid-Maoist-strike/article16299301.ece

  Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) on Friday ceased to exist, ending a political saga of over two decades of non-violent resistance to the continuing military rule in Myanmar.The party attracted “automatic dissolution” upon refusing to re-register under the junta's poll decrees, promulgated two months ago as the framework for a promised general election at an unspecified time. The timeline for re-registration ended at the stroke of midnight on Thursday.The NLD leaders and activists will, however, seek to transform the now-defunct party into a social service organisation, according to Nyan Win, Ms. Suu Kyi's close political associate. Details of the proposed outfit have not yet been finalised.Mr. Nyan Win told The Hindu from Yangon that the new move was in line with the “opinion of Ms. Suu Kyi,” still serving her latest term of house arrest. On a parallel track, four ex-NLD-leaders decided to form a new political party under the tentative name of a national democratic force.Tracing how the NLD was now passing into history, he said the Myanmar Supreme Court had in fact refused to accept an application from her for a ruling that the junta's current election laws were illegal.Her main contention was that the decree on registration of political parties for the promised poll was so crafted as to have the effect of banning the NLD. To retain recognition as a political party, the NLD was required to distance itself from her on the ground that she was serving a “judicial sentence” upon being found “guilty” of violating the restrictions under her previous term of house arrest.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Suu-Kyis-party-looks-beyond-dissolution/article16299125.ece

  North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il on Friday ended his four-day secretive visit to China, telling his hosts he was willing to help revive stalled negotiations over his country's controversial nuclear programme.“The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is willing to work with you to create favourable conditions for a resumption of the talks,” Mr. Kim told Chinese President Hu Jintao, according to a report in the Chinese official media.Mr. Kim this week held extensive meetings with Mr. Hu, and also met Premier Wen Jiabao and the seven other top leaders of the ruling Communist Party — a rare occurrence for a visiting head of state, reflecting the unique relationship between the two countries and the importance with which China views ties with its internationally-isolated neighbour.Official media quoted Mr. Kim as saying he was willing “to create favourable conditions” to resume the stalled six-party talks — the dialogue framework with South Korea, the United States, Japan and Russia over the North's controversial nuclear programme. North Korea quit the talks after the United Nations imposed sanctions following a nuclear test conducted last April.Whether the statement suggested the stalled talks would actually resume remained unclear. South Korea's Yonhap news agency, which has close ties to South Korean intelligence, reported that Mr. Kim had all but committed his willingness to return to talks during a banquet with Mr. Hu on Wednesday. However, Chinese analysts cautioned that the wording of Mr. Kim's statement left enough wiggle-room for other interpretations.During his visit, his first to China in four years, Mr. Kim also sought greater Chinese financial and food aid, amid persisting economic troubles and resource shortages in North Korea. “China will, as always, support the DPRK's economic development and improving people's livelihood,” Mr. Wen reportedly told the North Korean leader.China's media had, until Friday, blacked out all coverage of the visit of the North Korean leader, who insists on a high degree of secrecy for his state visits citing security fears. He arrived in north-eastern China on Tuesday, crossing the border in his armoured train. Mr. Kim has a fear of flying.Much of the focus this past week has been on the extreme secrecy with which the Chinese authorities have handled the visit, as well as on the massive security arrangements that have been put in place.An entire town in the north-east was essentially under police lockdown, and reporters had been barred from covering any part of the trip.Japanese journalists who managed to sneak a photograph of a frail-looking and limping Mr. Kim leaving a luxury hotel in the city of Dalian were detained by police.Official confirmation of Mr. Kim's “unofficial visit” came only after the North Korean leader was safely back in his home country on Friday.Even on Thursday afternoon, the Foreign Ministry claimed it “had no information” over Mr. Kim's visit, though grainy television images broadcast on South Korean media had left little doubt over his presence in the only country he can call an ally.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Will-work-with-Beijing-on-N-talks-Kim/article16299124.ece

  Gordon Brown returned to Downing Street — the London home of the British Premier — on Friday morning in a symbolic gesture that he is still Prime Minister, as all three of the main party leaders awaited the final results that will determine where the power lies in what certain to be a hung Parliament.Mr. Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron are locked in a constitutional standoff. The Tory leader claimed Labour had lost the right to govern but the Prime Minister, confident the Tories had not secured an overall majority, said he would look to see if he could form an alliance with the Liberal Democrats.All three leaders are now regrouping to plan their next move. Mr. Brown has the Constitution on his side and will have the first chance to form a government. But the Tories are claiming he does not retain the “moral authority” to govern, given the scale of the defeat, and the Lib Dems are wary of a coalition that does not have popular support, given their disappointing performance at the polls.With just a few seats left to declare, Mr. Cameron asserted that his party was on course to gain more seats than at any time in 80 years. He said it was clear that the country wants change that requires new leadership. He needs 326 to win an overall majority, something Tory insiders privately accept is out of their reach. Sources in the party said early on Friday that they expected to reach 314, which would be enough to operate with the support of the Democratic Unionists in Northern Ireland.Lord Mandelson told Sky News this morning : “The Prime Minister's duty is to stay at his post, to continue doing his job and not resign until it is clear who the Queen should call as an alternative to form a new government, should Mr Brown not be able to do so. The Prime Minister can't just resign and leave a vacuum for the Queen to deal with.” In the case of a hung Parliament, Lord Mandelson said: “Either there has to be a minority government which tries its chances or a combination of other parties — in this case most likely the Labour party and Liberal Democrats — would have to see if they can form some arrangement instead.” Amid vastly different regional swings, the results showed strong Labour resilience outside the south, and the Lib Dems had badly underperformed against euphoric expectations of only a week ago.Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was said to be depressed by the result, and wary of forming a “coalition of the defeated” that might be seen as ignoring the public mood. Mr. Brown flew to London from his Scottish constituency to offer the Lib Dems the chance to form a stable government, culminating in a referendum on electoral reform for the Commons.Mr. Clegg will wait to see the final result and meet his new group of MPs tomorrow. Some in his party will claim he can form a stable coalition for two years to deliver recovery and political reform, but others will be nervous of appearing to shun the electorate's will. The Tory leader, reflecting on the coming battle for power with Mr. Brown, promised to put the national interest first in “the hours ahead, or perhaps longer than the hours ahead”.Speaking after he had been returned in Kirkcaldy with an increased majority, Mr. Brown said: “My duty to the country coming out of this election is to play my part in Britain having a strong, stable and principled government able to lead Britain into sustained economic recovery and able to implement our commitments to far—reaching reform upon which there is a growing consensus in our country.” Mr. Brown's aides said they would try to form a progressive alliance if the Tories did not score as high as 320 seats. Private talks between intermediaries started almost as soon as the polls closed, but few were willing to predict the outcome.

  | Photo Credit: Alastair Grant The Conservative Party was on Friday in talks with the Liberal Democrats to form a minority government with their support after Britain's most closely-contested election of modern times resulted in a hung Parliament and defeat for the ruling Labour Party after 13 years in power.Conservative leader David Cameron and his Lib Dem counterpart, Nick Clegg, spoke on the phone and agreed to hold further discussions. This effectively put paid to Gordon Brown's hopes of staying on as Prime Minister with the Lib Dems' backing as part of a “progressive alliance.”The first move towards a deal with the Conservatives came from Mr. Clegg even as the results were still coming in. In a statement, he said that as the single largest party with “more votes and more seats” the Conservatives should have the right to seek to govern first.“It is vital that all parties… act in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage,” he said in an apparent reference to Mr. Brown's bid to hang on to power taking advantage of the British constitutional convention, under which the incumbent Prime Minister has the right to stay on until he/she is defeated on the floor of the House.Mr. Cameron was quick to reciprocate with what he described as “a big, open and comprehensive offer” to the Lib Dems claiming that the two had a common position on a number of issues. In remarks that were seen as a hint at a coalition with the Lib Dems rather than simply issue-based support, he said: “I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems — the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system,” he said.Mr. Cameron, whose party is expected to end up with 306 seats — 20 short of an outright majority — pointedly referred to Mr. Brown as the “outgoing Prime Minister” saying he had “lost the mandate to govern.” People, he said, had voted for “change” and a new type of politicsStressing the need for political stability at a time of deep economic crisis, he said: “We need a government that reassures the international markets. We need policies that will bring economic recovery.”Earlier, in a brief statement, Mr. Brown said he respected Mr. Clegg's wish to make contact with the Conservatives first but “should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing... I would be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties.”According to reports, the Lib Dems have not closed the door on negotiations with Labour but might demand change of leader as a condition for support. Both Labour and the Conservatives were also wooing smaller regional parties such as the Scottish National Party, the Unionist parties of Northern Ireland and the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru.Labour is expected to end with 258 MPs and the Lib Dems 57.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Conservatives-in-talks-with-Liberal-Democrats-in-Britain/article16299267.ece

Neither of the two main parties would be able to govern with a majority of their own.Mr. Brown cited the “immediate economic challenges,” including the Greek crisis and the “deteriorating situation in the euro area” as reasons why a quick solution to the stalemate must be found.

They will be the first Asian woman MPs in the House.The poll in the constituency of Thirsk and Malton has been postponed until May 27 due to the death of the UKIP candidate, John Boakes.Only 25 seats are left to be declared and even if Conservatives win all of them, they will still be short of an absolute majority — 326 seats.Liberal Democrats leader Mr. Clegg, who has emerged as a king-maker, said the party with the largest number of seats and votes should assume power.Mr. Clegg said the Conservatives had the “first right to seek to govern” after the election.“I’ve said that whichever party gets the most votes and the most seats, if not an absolute majority, has the first right to seek to govern either on its own or by reaching out to other parties, and I stick to that view,” Mr. Clegg said.“It seems this morning that it is the Conservative Party that has more votes and more seats though not an absolute majority.”An alliance, if not a coalition, between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats crosses the magic figure of 326 seats.Mr. Cameron declared that Mr. Brown and the Labour party had lost the mandate to rule. “Our country wants change. That change is going to require new leadership,” Mr. Cameron said and also indicated that he will enter into negotiations to determine who will form the next government.“What will guide me will be our national interest,” he said.Mr. Brown, on the other hand, insisted that it was his duty to ensure that Britain had a ""strong, stable and principled"" government, which pointed towards a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Conservatives-look-set-to-form-next-govt.-in-U.K./article16299078.ece

  An Australian opposition Senator, who dubbed burqa as “un—Australian” and sought its ban in the country, has been criticised by the Muslim community as well as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi lashed out in an article which was published on The Drum website, saying the burqa “needs to be binned“.Mr. Bernardi’s comment has irked Australia’s peak Islamic organisation which has reacted with disappointment over comments.He called it a “repressive domination of men over women” and said it establishes “different sets and expectations in society“.Mr. Rudd today accused the opposition of playing a cynical political exercise by floating the idea and said: “I think they are walking both sides of the street on this one....having someone like Bernardi go out there and talk this up.”“It’s a pretty interesting exercise in cynical politics” he added.In his article, Mr. Bernardi said it was unfair that people with motorcycle helmets had to remove them to identify themselves, where women wearing burqas did not because of religious freedom.“As an avid motorcyclist I am required to remove my helmet before entering a bank or petrol station,” he said.“It’s a security measure for the businesses and no reasonable person objects to this requirement.“However, if I cover myself in a black cloth from head to toe, with only my eyes barely visible behind a mesh guard, I am effectively unidentifiable and can waltz into any bank unchallenged in the name of religious freedom.”However, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said a ban on the burqa was not coalition policy.Muhammad Dahir from Islamic Association of Australia said the burqa is not a compulsory part of Islamic culture and most women have no problem showing their face to identify themselves.“If people want to see your face, then there’s nothing wrong with that, they have to accept these things. The majority of the Muslim community have no problem with that,” he said admitting there were some areas of society where men will force their wives to wear a burqa, but for the rest, it was a woman’s choice to cover herself completely.Mr. Bernardi also said Australia also needs to move towards a full ban and that migrating Muslims need to adopt Australian values.“New arrivals to this country should not come here to recreate the living environment they have just left,” he said.“They should come here for a better life based on the freedoms and values that have built our great nation.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Australian-Senator-flayed-for-burqa-comments/article16299017.ece

It was his first visit to China in four years.Diplomats in Beijing had expected Kim to ask China, one of the hermit state’s few allies, for economic aid and investment.

  As federal investigators try hard to find any possible link between Faisal Shahzad and terror groups in Pakistan, a top American general today said militant outfits like the LeT, blamed for the 26/11 attacks, has “transnational goals” like the Al-Qaeda.“The extremists in many cases would like to be transnational organisations, not just active in Pakistan, but indeed active elsewhere.“Al Qaeda, of course, is foremost among them, LeT, who carried out the Mumbai attack, another organisation with transnational goals and activities,” General David Petraeus, Commander of the US Central Command, told the MSNBC in an interview.His comments assume significance in the wake of US investigators probing whether Pakistani—American Faisal Shahzad, arrested for the failed Times Square bomb attack, had any links with Pakistani Taliban or other extremist groups based in the tribal areas of Pakistan.The FBI had on Wednesday said 30—year—old Shahzad had admitted to attending a terror training camp in the restive Waziristan tribal region.Gen. Petraeus was recently in Pakistan holding meetings with its top leadership on how to take action against these terrorist outfits.“It may be that the Pakistani Taliban has some of these (goals) as well...The way they generate resources, the way they get recruits, they way they can proselytise is indeed by successful high— profile operations. You’ve seen that as well with the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Anwar al—Awlaki, the Yemeni—American,” Gen.

But, you know, you had the planes flown into tall buildings, what is the next initiative going to be? And certainly this is among those. There has been an outreach through cyberspace.“It’s one reason that some of us have said we can’t allow cyberspace, which is a battlefield, just like a ground battlefield, to be uncontested space. We have to be active there as well, while certainly still ensuring the rights and freedoms of Americans, to be sure,” he said.Gen. Petraeus was in Pakistan, when the Times Square incident happened.He said the countries have to show “sustained and substantial” commitment in fighting terror elements.“We have recognised the impressive campaign that the Pakistani military has carried out in Swat Valley and in these other areas of their country where the Pakistani Taliban was threatening the Pakistani governance,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/LeT-has-transnational-goals-Gen.-Petraeus/article16299024.ece
1220,Uncertainty as Britain grapples with hung Parliament,PTI,2010-05-07,09:28:49 IST,"Uncertainty reigned on Friday as Britain’s main parties headed for an intense power battle after the general election resulted in a hung Parliament.The situation in which neither of the two big parties gained enough votes to form a government on its own was confirmed by results from most of the 649 constituencies.After results in 615 constituencies were counted, the Tories had 290 seats, followed by Labour with 247 and the Liberal Democrats with 51.The results mean it will be impossible for the Tories to reach the minimum of 326 seats required for an overall majority.The ruling Labour Party under Prime Minister Gordon Brown has indicated that it would aim to stay on in government with the support of smaller parties.Speaking after his re-election in his constituency in Scotland, Mr. Brown said it was his duty to secure a strong and stable government in Britain.“The outcome of this country’s vote is not yet known, but my duty to the country, coming out of this election, is to play my part in Britain having a strong, stable and principled government, able to lead Britain into sustained economic recovery,” he said.The official result of the election is expected later Friday.As the wait for clarity continued, Mr. Brown was locked in talks with his closest aides in Downing Street to assess the possibilities of a government pact with smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats.But there were clear signs that the process would be drawn out.The Liberal Democratic Party, led by Nick Clegg, said it would hold a meeting on Saturday to consider whether to enter into an alliance with Labour, or Mr. David Cameron’s Conservatives.Meanwhile, there were no signs that Queen Elizabeth II, who would have to “invite” the future government leader, was in any hurry to do so.The monarch, who was staying at the Windsor Castle outside London, was unlikely to become involved until the situation became clear, Constitutional experts said.It was her view that it was “up to the politicians to get together to produce a solution,” said one expert.“The monarch is not a referee,” he said, adding that the monarchy would be damaged if her role was seen to be “politicised.” It was already clear that Labour had lost the mandate to govern, Mr. Cameron said early on Friday.But Peter Mandelson, the Business Secretary and key Labour strategist, insisted that Labour could seek to form a government.“The rules are that if it’s a hung parliament, it’s not the party with the largest number of seats that has first go — it’s the sitting government,” he said.However, when asked whether the situation would become less intractable if Mr. Brown resigned and Labour put forward another candidate for the party leadership, he said: “All sorts of things are possible.” The result was a shock for the Liberal Democrats, led by Mr. Clegg, who appeared set to win fewer seats than in the last general election in 2005.Mr. Clegg, who had been branded the “superstar” of the 2010 election, campaigning for the Liberal Democrats to be given greater weight in Britain’s traditional two-party system, on Friday described the results for his party as disappointing.“We simply haven’t achieved what we had hoped,” he said.The key question now is whether the Liberal Democrats, desperate to seize the chance of a lifetime, would back Labour in a Lib-Lab pact.The Liberals have been campaigning for electoral reform, aimed at replacing the present majority first-past-the-post system with proportional representation.Several top Labour politicians indicated on Friday that the party would be prepared to hold talks on the issue.Under the unwritten rules of Britain’s constitution, the sitting Prime Minister has the first option to ask Queen Elizabeth II for the chance to form a government.However, convention also states that the party with the most seats has the “moral” right to ask to form a government.Markets showed signs of nervousness early Friday, as shares fell under the dual pressure of the Greek debt crisis and the hung parliament in Britain.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Uncertainty-as-Britain-grapples-with-hung-Parliament/article16299325.ece

  Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese president, held talks in Beijing with Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Mr. Kim paid an unofficial visit to China from May 3 to 7 as Mr. Hu’s guest. During their talks, Mr. Hu expressed warm welcome to Mr. Kim on behalf of the CPC, Chinese government and people.Mr. Hu also expressed gratitude for the condolence from the DPRK to earthquake—hit Yushu in northwest China, as well as the DPRK’s active participation in the World Expo in Shanghai.During Mr. Kim’s stay in Beijing, Mr. Hu hosted a welcoming banquet in honour of Mr. Kim and accompanied Mr. Kim in a visit to a biological company. Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and Wen Jiabao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese premier, met with Mr. Kim respectively.Other members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang, respectively accompanied Mr. Kim for the visiting tour. Mr. Hu said the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK is the common treasures of the two governments, parties and peoples, and it is the historical responsibility of the two sides to push forward their friendship with the progress of the times and from generation to generation.He said in recent years, Sino—DPRK relations have made continuous achievements, and last year in particular, the two countries celebrated the 60th anniversary of Sino—DPRK diplomatic ties and successfully held the Year of Friendship, and the political contacts and cooperation in all areas have been fruitful.Strengthening Sino—DPRK friendly and cooperative relations is the consistent policy of the CPC and the Chinese government, he said.Mr. Hu said China always handles, maintains and pushes forward the relations with the DPRK in a strategic and long—term perspective, and will make joint efforts with the DPRK to upgrade the relationship to benefit the two peoples and to contribute to lasting regional peace and common prosperity.Mr. Hu said boosting Sino—DPRK cooperation helps the two countries promote their own socialist construction, and safeguard and develop the common interests as well as regional peace, stability and prosperity. He put forward five proposals to strengthen ties with the DPRK: ——To maintain high—level contacts. The leaders of the two countries should keep in touch by exchanging visits, as well as sending special envoys and messages.——To reinforce strategic coordination. The two sides should exchange views in a timely manner and regularly on major domestic and diplomatic issues, international and regional situation, as well as on governance experience.——To deepen economic and trade cooperation. The relevant departments of the two governments should discuss and explore ways on expanding economic and trade cooperation.——To increase personnel exchanges. The two sides should expand exchanges in the cultural, sports, and educational fields, and the contacts between the youth in particular to inherit the traditional friendship from generation to generation.——To strengthen coordination in international and regional affairs to better serve regional peace and stability.Mr. Kim said he fully agrees with Mr. Hu’s proposals on pragmatic cooperation between the two countries.The traditional DPRK—China friendship, established and cultivated by leaders of old generations of the two states, has stood tests of the times, and will not change due to the change of time and alteration of generations, Mr. Kim said.The series of celebration activities marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties last year lifted the DPRK—China friendship to a new high in history, he said.With the joint efforts from the two sides, sound momentum of development has emerged in bilateral friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields, Mr. Kim said, noting the recent agreement on the construction of a new bridge over the border river, the Yalu River, will become a new symbol of DPRK—China friendly cooperation.With the principle of mutual benefit and win—win, the DPRK welcomes Chinese enterprises to invest in the country and will actively lift the level and quality of bilateral pragmatic cooperation, Mr. Kim said.The DPRK Party and government always view and handle relations with China from a strategic and long—term point of view, and are determined to inherit and pass on the DPRK—China relations, which have seen continuous consolidation and development, he said.Mr. Kim expressed his warm congratulations on the successful opening of the World Expo in Shanghai and his condolence to the casualty and property loss caused by the earthquake in Yushu, Qinghai Province.During each of his visits to China, Mr. Kim said, he could witness the new achievements made by Chinese people in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.China’s achievements are a great encouragement to the people of the DPRK, he said.The DPRK’s work in various fields is progressing orderly, and the core task of all the work of the DPRK party is to constantly improve the living standard of the people, Mr. Kim said.Mr. Hu spoke highly of DPRK’s active measures which have been taken to maintain stability, boost economy and improve people’s living conditions. He also expressed his wishes for the DPRK to achieve greater goals in the nation’s development under the leadership of the WPK, headed by Mr. Kim.Mr. Kim said he believes that under the leadership of the CPC, with President Hu as general secretary, Chinese people will continuously record new victories in the historical progress of improving the party’s ruling capability, practicing the scientific concept on development and building a harmonious society.Mr. Kim invited Mr. Hu to visit DPRK at his convenience. Mr. Hu appreciated and accepted the invitation.Mr. Hu also accompanied Mr. Kim in a visit to a bio—company in Beijing. During the visit, Mr. Kim said he got new understandings of China’s development and progress in relevant fields, especially in harmonious development and innovation, compared with the last visit to China four years ago.The DPRK people are proud of China’s achievements in its national development, he said. During the China tour, Mr. Kim also visited some economic development zones, bonded ports, and several food—processing, hi—tech and machinery companies in the cities of Dalian, Tianjin, Beijing and Shenyang.In Dalian, a booming coastal city in northeast China, Mr. Kim instructed DPRK officials in his delegation to study the experience of China’s renovation of its old industrial base.In Tianjin, Mr. Kim spoke highly of the development of a bonded port in the economic hub in north China.Mr. Kim’s entourage included Kim Yong Chun, vice chairman of the National Defence Commission, and senior officials with the DPRK’s foreign ministry, the WPK Central Committee and the DRPK cabinet.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Top-leaders-of-China-North-Korea-hold-talks-in-Beijing/article16299023.ece
1223,Unfair to focus only on Pakistan: Roemer,Sandeep Dikshit,2010-05-07,02:35:12 IST,"The United States has decried focussing only on Pakistan in regard to terrorism, by pointing out that there were terrorist groups in all parts of the world. It also expressed its willingness to carry out joint projects with India in Afghanistan, but the foreign office here distanced itself from any such proposal.Briefing journalists after returning from Kabul and Islamabad, U.S. Ambassador Timothy Roemer said that while Pakistan must do more to tackle terrorism, the focus should not be on that county alone, as there were other groups such as the Indian Mujahideen, which Indian intelligence agencies claim are operating all across the country.“Let's not focus on one particular country — we have Indian Mujahideen, we have Headley in Chicago, we have Faisal Shahzad [alleged to have attempted a bombing in Times Square]. It is very clear that the U.S. has said to Pakistan that we want more...We see it doing. We expect more.”“Whether we call a group Al-Qaeda, LeT [Lashkar-e-Taiba], JeM [Jaish-e-Mohammad] whatever the name, we have a serpent network of extremist groups targeting all of us — whether it is Pakistanis, whether it is Indians, whether it is Americans and we have to work together.” Mr. Roemer said the cooperation between the U.S. and India in the case of David Headley (prime accused in Mumbai terror attacks on November 26, 2008) was “unprecedented,” with both sides having exchanged “reams of information” on the issue. India now needs to work out the exact timings and dates to get access to Headley, currently in U.S. custody.Eyebrows were raised in the External Affairs Ministry over Mr. Roemer's claim that in Kabul he assessed the possibility of joint India-U.S. projects in areas such as capacity building for civil servants. “As far as we know, the U.S. Ambassador to India was interested in the projects we had done. There is no such move to undertake joint projects,” clarified sources.Asked about Pakistan's response on Afghanistan, Mr. Roemer said most of his interaction with its President and Foreign Minister fell in the zone of privileged diplomatic conversation. “Pakistan's response was thoughtful, considered and responsible in many ways. It showed they continued to think very clearly,” he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Unfair-to-focus-only-on-Pakistan-Roemer/article16298970.ece
1224,Pakistan hopes talks will not be hit,Anita Joshua,2010-05-07,00:03:11 IST,"As news broke of Ajmal Kasab being awarded the death sentence for his role in the Mumbai 2008 terror attacks, Pakistan on Thursday hoped that non-state actors, and shrill statements made by a section of Indian polity and officialdom would not derail the dialogue that was resumed in Thimphu only last week.Asked for a reaction by the media at a routine briefing just as television channels were beaming the trial court verdict, Foreign Office spokesman Abdul Basit — in the first official reaction to the death sentence — said legal experts would need to go through the detailed judgment first. At the same time, he pointed out that Pakistan had strongly condemned the horrific Mumbai attack and said “it is important that culprits are brought to book.''On the specific issue of observations by Indian officials that the verdict was a message to Pakistan that it should not export terror, Mr. Basit said: “It is important to avoid such far-fetched statements as both countries have agreed to resume dialogue.''Meanwhile, in an interview to “Devil's Advocate'' on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was optimistic of the spirit of dialogue prevailing over hiccups like Kasab's conviction and indictment of Hafiz Saeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi of the Lashkar-e-Taiba.Stating that the prime ministers of India and Pakistan have acknowledged dialogue as the only sensible way forward, he said: “Yes, there will be difficulties and hiccups but we have to move on. We have a much bigger agenda and we should not let any individual, non-state actor or any terrorist organisation impede the peace process. We should develop it to such an extent that it becomes irreversible.''On whether Pakistan would accept the death sentence or plead for leniency, Mr. Qureshi said: “We will have to respect each other's judicial process.'' As for Pakistan seeking Kasab's extradition, the Minister pointed out that it was not the decision of the government but a requirement of the court. “The Government of Pakistan was conveying the decision of the court.'' This distinction was again drawn by the Foreign Office spokesman at his weekly briefing.Contesting the charge made by the media that Pakistan has been spineless in its response when cases are filed against its nationals overseas, Mr. Basit said the government has always provided legal aid where it is legitimate. “We need to draw a distinction between where assistance is legitimately required and where it is not.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Pakistan-hopes-talks-will-not-be-hit/article13797885.ece
1225,Seven steps to control your Facebook privacy,DPA,2010-05-07,19:24:45 IST,"Exerting a complete lockdown on your Facebook information is a complicated task that someone should write a book about, and which would take eternal vigilance to maintain.But casual users of the world’s most popular social networking website can take seven easy steps to safeguard sensitive personal information and prevent it appearing to other Facebook users, marketers and across the Internet.1. Make friends with your Profile Privacy Page: spend 1 per cent of your Facebook time exploring what it can do for you.2. Control your contact information: you should limit it to close friends or — better yet — nobody. Let people contact you via a Facebook message.3. Your “friends” aren’t really your friends: they include acquaintances, family and professional contacts. Put people into different Friend Lists — private groupings of people who can be given different privacy settings.4. Pay attention to photos: avoid the ultimate Facebook nightmare — being tagged in an embarrassing photo that everyone can then see.This is a little confusing and can be found under the Friends, Tags and Connections section in the privacy settings.5. Control who can see your albums via the photos privacy page.6. Remove your Facebook info from search engines like Google via the search privacy settings page.7.

1226,Your life is an open book if you use Facebook,DPA,2010-05-07,19:22:21 IST,"Facebook has drawn flak from consumer groups for not taking user privacy seriously enough.
  As the world’s most popular social networking site, Facebook has more data on us than any other private company, and a lot more than most governments.So it can be both disconcerting and dangerous when the website — whether as a matter of policy or by mistake — lets out a lot more information than we would like.Unfortunately for Facebook and its users, that’s happening all too frequently. As the magazine PC World so succinctly put it after the last debacle: “Another day, another Facebook security snafu.” The latest glitch was revealed on Wednesday when Facebook said it had fixed a security bug that allowed user’s to snoop on their friends’ private chats and view the pending friend requests by others.In March, a bug exposed the private emails of many users and limited their ability to hide other contact information.In December, Facebook changed its privacy settings, sparking a new Facebook protest group that now boasts more than 2.2 million members.The new settings automatically share members’ information, unless they take specific steps to opt out of the info giveaway. That meant that your name, profile picture, gender, current city, networks, Friends List and all the pages you subscribe to were made publicly available and searchable for anyone on the web to see.Prior to that there was Beacon, a Facebook information system that mined data from member profiles to send them targeted ads and displayed users visits to external sites on their Facebook stream.Though a mass public outcry prompted Facebook to quickly abandon that idea, its newly-announced OpenGraph initiative is proving just as controversial.Given that the aim of OpenGraph is to accompany Facebook members on their travels to every corner of the web, the problem could get much more serious.The OpenGraph initiative allows websites to adopt the Facebook Connect sign-in system so that users activities on other sites are shared with all their Facebook friends.Some aspects of the idea sound good in theory, because they will make the web more personal. But it also means that you could unwittingly expose your web activities to your wife, employer or anyone of the hundreds of people who might be “friends” on Facebook but who in reality are just as likely to be mere acquaintances, work colleagues or rivals.That possibility scares privacy advocates. The Electronic Privacy Information Centre, an advocacy group, filed a complaint on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission.“Facebook continues to manipulate the privacy settings of users and its own privacy policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited purpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes,” Marc Rotenberg, the group’s executive director, said in a letter to the commission.Facebook, which overtook MySpace as the platform of choice largely because of the control it gave users of their profiles, insists that it is fully focused on its members’ privacy needs.Elliott Schrage, Facebook’s vice-president for public policy, told The New York Times that “for a service that has grown as dramatically as we have grown, we think our track record for security and safety is unrivalled.” Many critics disagree, pointing to the flippant comments on privacy by billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 25, who said in January that privacy was no longer a “social norm.”“People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people,” he said. “That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.” He has a point, according to a recent study by Consumer Reports.The study of 2,000 online US households found that two-thirds of them used Facebook or MySpace. Of those, 52 per cent of them posted personal information that could pose a threat to them and their families, the report found.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/Your-life-is-an-open-book-if-you-use-Facebook/article16299087.ece

  | Photo Credit: The Hindu One of the signs that show a city has 'arrived', according to most youngsters, is when it has multi-national food chains; a place where they can hangout with friends and with good food. Well, going by that admission, the city is showing signs of arriving as Marrybrown, a Malaysian chain, has reached the city. True, we have Subway and Dominos (open only to Techies), but a popular fast food joint in the heart of the city is a first.Located at Panavila Junction, near the Bakery junction flyover, this 60-seater three-storied restaurant (the top floor might be turned into a party hall) is cosy. Actually a bit too cosy as the tables and seats (which are comfy) are too close for comfort.A quick look at the menu and it's the combo meals that catch your eye. We order combo 5, (which has a choice of either a rib and a drumstick or a thigh and wing) and combo 6 (two pieces of chicken, a side of coleslaw, a serving of mashed potato and a pet bottle of cola).Other interesting combos include combo 2 that has a double-decked burger (Rs. 149), a paneer wrap combo (Rs. 55) and combo 6 that has five pieces of fried chicken wings that is served with a hot and sweet dip (Rs. 99). All combo meals come with a side of fries and a glass of cola.We also order a kiddie meal (a choice of chicken or vegetarian burger, smileys or chicken poppers and a glass of orange juice) that comes with a surprise gift.The chicken has a crisp slightly spicy outer coating and is cooked just right. It is also not too oily. While the coleslaw has generous grated vegetables covered with a helping of mayonnaise, the mashed potato tastes as if it was cooked in stock. It has bits of pepper in it which gives the dish a bite. The chicken burger has a succulent thick pate placed in between a soft bun. Ground chicken meat that is mildly spiced is made into balls and fried for the chicken poppers.
Finger food
Those who have small appetites can order burgers and fried chicken a la carte. There is also a choice of finger food like chicken lollipop (Rs. 60), chicken nuggets (Rs. 55), nachos (Rs. 40) and Tandoori nuggets (Rs. 35). A choice of vegetarian and non-vegetarian rice meals are for those who need their daily dose of rice. While two pieces of fried chicken, a helping of coleslaw and pulau comprises the non-vegetarian, instead of fried chicken, it is smileys (potato wafers) that is different in the vegetarian version. The restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Contact: 4061010.",https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Food/Merry-times-ahead/article16299065.ece
1228,Talking movies,Saraswathy Nagarajan,2010-05-07,17:50:12 IST,"Malayalam movie Director T.K.Rajeev Kumar Photo: S. Mahinsha
  | Photo Credit: S.MAHINSHA Filmmaker T.K. Rajeevkumar's work defies categorisation. Viewers have learnt to expect the unexpected from this film director. After a lull, he returns with two films – Khushti in Hindi and Oru Naal Varum in Malayalam. Khushti is the remake of Mutharamkunnu P.O. while Oru Naal Varum revives the winning duo of Mohanlal and Sreenivasan on screen.While many other directors would take a break after the hectic shooting and promotional work, Rajeev plans to travel in India and Europe to document the sounds of percussion and to “jam with percussionists who play a wide range of interesting percussion instruments,” says Rajeev, a trained percussionist.Before Rajeev engraved his credits on the screen, he was a well-known name on the campuses of Kerala as a superb percussionist and mimic. One of his hit performances was a panchavadyam that faithfully duplicated the sounds and rhythms of a percussion ensemble without a single instrument on stage. “Over the years, I have become a little rusty and so I have started training in earnest on the mridangam, maddalam and also on other percussion instruments such as the thavil, thimila and the edakka,” says Rajeev.
Percussion yatra
He also plans to film the jamming sessions. The percussion yatra, which will also be filmed, will culminate in a concert in the capital city, adds Rajiv.He says it is the quest for new subjects and styles of filmmaking that keeps intact his passion for filmmaking. A passion that was ignited during his student days when Venu, a relative and a role model, joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to study cinematography. “G. Aravindan was also a relative and a family friend. I yearned to study filmmaking. The late seventies and early eighties were the heyday of film societies and the first ever Kerala University film festival opened my eyes to a new language and vocabulary of cinema,” says Rajeev.Although, he qualified for the entrance exam, he never made it to FTII as his parents were keen on him taking up a white collar job. But the Zoology graduate kept alive his silver screen dreams even while creating waves on the campuses with his mimicry and music troupes.“Once, after a show in Muhamma, entrepreneur Mathew Paul met me and asked me if I was interested in films. He directed me to Navodaya where I met my mentor Jijo. I made it clear to him that I had no interest in becoming an actor. I felt I did not have the looks to become one. When he heard of my attempt to join FTII and my ambition, he took me, still a student, on aboard the team of My Dear Kuttichathan, the first 3-D film in Malayalam,” recalls Rajeev.One thing led to another and soon the young director was calling the shots for the big budget multi-starrer Chanakyan, starring Kamal Hassan, Madhu, Thilakan and Jayaram. A dream break for any director. “My first shot was with Madhu sir. I still remember him putting me at ease by asking: ‘Rajiv, what is the next shot?' I was able to give him a convincing answer. Despite having a galaxy of veterans in my film, it was my film. Never once did any of them try to step into my space.”After the racy Chanakyan, just when everyone expected him to direct another action-packed film, Rajeev came out with the romance-filled Kshanakathu.“I did get several offers from Tamil and Telugu to direct Chanakyan. Kamal even wanted me to direct the Hindi version of Avai Shammughi. But I refused. My stand is that one has to pursue new themes and genres to challenge one's own creative boundaries.”Rajeev agrees that this has its own drawbacks and advantages. “Being associated with a certain kind of films helps pull in viewers who are drawn to that category of films. If the film lives up to their expectations, then you have made it. So each film has to pique their curiosity and keep them glued to the screen,” explains Rajeev. Therein lies the challenge for Rajeev the filmmaker who agrees that this sometimes translated into films that did not set the cash registers ringing.
Eclectic filmography
Thus his eclectic collection of films include Ottayal Pattalam, Mahanagaram, Pavithram, Kannezhuthi Pottum Thottu,' ‘
Sesham' ….And then Rajeev took over as Chairman of the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy in 2003. A decision that surprised many then. “It was not about the position but I wanted to see how one could best synergise cinema, the Government and the Academy. Plans to begin a touring talkies, to set up a permanent centre for cinema and so on were put into motion when I helmed the Academy. Decisions that are bearing fruit now. I see it as an educative period when I was able to test myself as an administrator and catalyst. It also gave me an opportunity to see and interact with world-class filmmakers and technicians.”In addition to films, Rajeev also went on to become a sought-after director for stage shows in India and abroad.However, Rajeev maintains that his first love has and will always be cinema. “My idol is Mrinal Sen. That is why I called my son Mrinal.”On being prodded to name his best works that he would want Mrinal and his daughter, Keerthana, to see, a little hesitantly, he says: Chanakyan, Pavithram, Kannezhuthi Pottum Thottu and Sesham.“I have to satisfy myself first and those are the films that met my own standards,” avers Rajeev.
Soundtrack

Rajeev tunes in to music when he is not thinking, talking and creating films. “I enjoy Carnatic music and my favourites are Maharajapuram and the Ambalappuzha Brothers. I also enjoy Western Symphonies a great deal.

Veeraswamy.The government purchased 2,000 mw and had put in “restriction and control measures” (load shedding in areas other than Chennai and its suburbs) to manage the deficit of rest of the 1,000 mw, he said.He said while the AIADMK government announced a few power generation projects, none of them were “actually implemented.” ‘We have been taking care on power-generation projects and some of the ongoing ones including those in Chennai and Mettur will be completed by next year,” he said adding the state could become power-surplus by 2012 or 2013.He said the delay in production from Koodankulam nuclear power plant, a joint initiative with Russia and dip in production at Kalpakkam and Kaiga (Karnataka) power plants were adding to the state’s woes on power front. Besides, low water levels in dams had affected hydel power generation.He said by the month-end, windmills were expected to increase power generation, which could ease the situation, following which load shedding could be relaxed.Number of consumers had also increased from 1.78 crore in 2005-06 to 2.12 crore in 2009-10, he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Increased-consumption-among-reasons-cited-for-TN-power-crisis/article16299066.ece

Venkatesan,2010-05-07,11:38:35 IST,"Holding that gas is a national asset and the Centre's pricing policy will prevail over any private agreement, the Supreme Court has directed Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) of the Mukesh Ambani group to initiate renegotiations with Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. (RNRL) of the Anil Ambani group for fixing the price of gas to be supplied to RNRL.Disposing of a batch of appeals, a Bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justices B. Sudershan Reddy and P. Sathasivam on Friday rejected RNRL's claim that it was entitled to get 28 mscmd of gas from the KG Basin at $2.34 mBtu in terms of a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Anil and Mukesh without any price approval by the government..In a separate judgment written by Justice Sathasivam and agreed to by the CJI, the Bench said that while initiating renegotiations “the parties should take into account the MoU [which], even though not legally binding, is a commitment which reflects the good interests of both parties.” This Bench expressed its dissent on some of the points dealt with by Justice Reddy in his separate judgment.Justice Reddy, while directing the parties to renegotiate, said the exercise should be dehors the MoU. Such renegotiations should be within the framework of governmental policy and approvals on price, quantity and tenure of supply of gas.Justice Sathasivam's judgment said: “It is not permissible for RIL to enter into a contract with RNRL to supply a fixed quantity as the gas continues to be the property of the government till the time it reaches the delivery point, and thus RIL has no right to dispose of the same without the express approval of the Union government.”On RNRL's contention that gas should be supplied without any governmental approval, the Bench said that having insisted on a Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) in conformity with the NTPC draft GSPA dated May 12, 2005 which contained an unequivocal stipulation of government approval for quantity, tenure and price, it was not open to the Anil group to argue that government approval for supply was not required.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Centres-gas-pricing-policy-will-prevail-rules-Supreme-Court/article16299180.ece

1244,"Decision soon on caste-based census, Manmohan assures Lok Sabha",Vinay Kumar,2010-05-07,16:16:38 IST,"TV grab shows Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressing the Lok Sabha on Friday.
  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday assured the Lok Sabha that the government would soon take a decision on the Opposition demand for a caste-based census.“I am aware of the views of the Members of Parliament belonging to all sections. I assure you that the Cabinet will take a decision shortly,” Dr. Singh said in a brief statement.The statement put at ease agitated Opposition members, particularly Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh, Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad and Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav.The three leaders and other Opposition members were ruffled over Home Minister P. Chidambaram's reply to the debate on census. He said there were difficulties in conducting a caste-based census and the government would keep in mind the members' views.As soon as the Minister concluded his reply, which was punctuated by interruptions from the Opposition benches, and the House was adjourned to meet again at 2.30 p.m., the three leaders approached the Prime Minister, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee. They were seen talking to them, trying to elicit some kind of an assurance on their demand. They also held a meeting with Mr. Mukherjee separately, when BJP's deputy leader Gopinath Munde was also present.When Dr. Singh gave the assurance soon after the House reassembled, the three leaders thanked him and the Congress president for trying to resolve the matter in an amicable manner.
“A valuable guide”
Earlier, while taking note of the discussion over the last two days that witnessed arguments and reasons for canvassing the question of caste, Mr. Chidambaram said the government was seized of the matter. “The views of honourable members will certainly be a valuable guide to the government,” he said in his statement, which virtually gave out nothing but offered explanation relating to the Census 2011 and preparation of the National Population Register (NPR), the two exercises which are on. The debate on the issue saw members cutting across party lines favouring a caste-based census.Replying to the debate, the Home Minister stressed that the main aim of the exercise was headcount and listed difficulties in including caste in the list. The Registrar-General had pointed out a number of logistics and practical difficulties in canvassing the question of caste while conducting census. However, he assured the House that the government “will give due weight to all aspects of the issue.”“The enumerator is not an investigator or verifier,” Mr. Chidambaram said, pointing out that 21 lakh enumerators — mostly primary school teachers — had no training or expertise to classify the answer as OBC or otherwise.“There is a Central list of OBCs and State-specific lists of OBCs. Some States do not have a list of OBCs while some have a list of OBCs and a sub-set called Most Backward Castes,” he said.
Many issues
Quoting the Registrar-General, Mr. Chidambaram said issues regarding methodology, avoiding phonetic and spelling errors, stage of canvassing of caste, maintaining integrity of enumeration and doing an accurate headcount of population would arise.“The census is done under the authority of the Census Act, 1948. Census 2011 will be the 15th national census since 1872 and the 7th since Independence. Population census is the total process of collecting demographic, economic and social data. What is published as the census data are only aggregates; the information relating to the individual is confidential and not shared with anyone or any authority,” he said.While throwing up the question if the census was the vehicle to carry out caste-based enumeration, he pointed out that records showed that an attempt was made by the Ministry of Social Justice to include caste as one of the questions that should be canvassed in the 2001 Census. “However, the government of the day — the NDA government — did not take a decision to that effect and maintained the policy that has been in force since 1951,” Mr. Chidambaram said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Decision-soon-on-caste-based-census-Manmohan-assures-Lok-Sabha/article16299151.ece

Mahtab and Arjun Charan Sethi (BJD) demanded that the university authorities be brought to book on charge of criminal negligence as, being “highly educated”, they ought to know the repercussions of auctioning the Gamma Cell as scrap.“Mistake was made by the (Delhi) University in not adhering” to rules and its own undertaking to atomic energy authorities that the device, which was used by its Chemistry Department, would not be re-sold, Mr. Chavan said replying to the Motion.He said the DU authorities “did not follow rules” and asserted that responsibility will be fixed. “No guilty person will be spared, I assure you,” Mr. Chavan told the House.The radioactive leakage occurred when a scrap, which originated from Delhi University’s Chemistry Department, was being cut at a shop.Responding to members’ concerns, the Minister said all the 112 cobalt slugs related to the accident have since been identified and sent to the Narora Nuclear Power Plant for safe keeping.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/DU-violated-rules-by-selling-radioactive-scrap-Govt./article16299044.ece

Advani explained to Ms. Patil the gist of the memorandum and why the MPs felt it necessary to complain to her about the “misuse” of CBI by the government.Later, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj told reporters, “Our main point was that CBI should remain impartial in its investigations. It has become a weapon in the hands of the Congress.”Ms. Swaraj enumerated cases against Congress leaders like Satish Sharma, Bofors pay-off accused Ottavio Quattrochi, and more recently the disproportionate assets cases against SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, RJD president Lalu Prasad and BSP supremo Mayawati in which CBI allegedly went slow or played a partisan role.However, the cases against Mr. Advani and Mr. Murli Manohar Joshi were expedited, she alleged.“We have also been in power but never misused the CBI. It has become the working style of the Congress to get a clean chit from CBI to their leaders, corner opposition leaders and dangle it like a Damocles’ Sword in front of those leaders who fall in between to get their support,” Ms. Swaraj said.The BJP leader insisted that the Congress-led government was misusing the CBI in the Sohrabuddin encounter case by arresting several police officers, which was “demoralising” the State police.She also questioned the timing of the arrests and said it was done when the Swarnim Gujarat (marking 50 years of formation of the State) celebrations were on, to embarrass the Narendra Modi government.BJP also sought a discussion in Parliament on the alleged misuse of CBI.“We will now raise this issue during the Monsoon session of Parliament as this session is getting over today,” Ms. Swaraj said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/BJP-leaders-submit-memorandum-on-lsquomisusersquo-of-CBI-to-President/article16299022.ece

  | Photo Credit: Visma Thapa Security was intensified at Mao checkgate on the Manipur-Nagaland border to arrest NSCN (IM) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah the moment he enters Manipur to reach his native village, as a 48-hour general strike to protest against the visit crippled life across the state.Official reports said Manipur Chief Minister O. Ibobi Singh had informed the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister about the situation in the state following the death of three persons at the Mao gate on the Nagaland side in a stampede resulting from the bursting of tear gas shells by the Manipur police on Thursday.On the other hand, Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio in a statement has held the Ibobi Singh government ?solely responsible? for the tense situation arising out of Muivah?s proposed visit to Somdal, his village in Ukhrul district.He said the Nagaland government had arranged for humanitarian and emergency services to the injured in yesterday?s incident.Mr. Rio said the alleged ?repressive action? of the Manipur government might jeopardise peace talks between the Centre and Naga underground groups.?It is unfortunate that the brute forces of the state government are being blatantly used to suppress the genuine voice and democratic rights of the people enshrined in the Constitution of India,? Mr. Rio said in his statement issued last night.Various Naga organizations blame Manipur government for the incident and have asked the Centre to defuse the tension over Muivah?s proposed visit, which has been put off following yesterday?s incident.Official reports said markets, shops and business establishments remained closed and transport services to neighbouring states were cancelled in response to the strike called by the All-Manipur United Clubs? Organisation last evening.Muivah?s visit has been opposed by Manipur government that says it would disturb communal amity in the state.The NSCN(IM) has been demanding a ?greater Nagaland? proposed be formed by merging Naga populated areas of adjoining states, which has been rejected by Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh governments.Several organizations like Naga Hoho, Naga Students? Federation, Naga Mothers? Association, Naga People?s Movement for Human Rights and Tenyimi People?s Organization, said they condemned ?the barbaric and inhuman act? of the Manipur police.Nagaland medical minister Kuzholuzo Nienu, accompanied by a local MLA, visited Naga Hospital in Kohima where seven of the injured are admitted.The minister told newsmen that apart from one injured who was put in the ICU, the remaining six were declared out of danger.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Security-intensified-at-Mao-checkgate-to-stall-Muivahs-visit/article16300143.ece
1251,"Fix accountability for sabotaging AI merger, say unions",PTI,2010-05-07,11:01:12 IST,"In this file photo,a man walks in the backdrop of a parked Air India plane at the airport in New Delhi. AP.
  A group of Air India unions today asked Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel to fix the accountability on those who are “sabotaging” the airlines merger process and have led to a loss of Rs. 18,000 crores in the last three years.Common Action Group (CAG), a group of unions of Air India—NACIL who have joined hands to save the national carrier, said that “accountability be fixed on those persons for sabotaging the merger process, propagating the rhetoric of de—merger and causing losses to the tune of Rs. 18,000 crores.”The CAG, in a statement, alleged that some anti—Air India (NACIL) lobbies comprised well—established people opposed to the merger of AI and Indian Airlines. The merger took place in 2007.“In a bid to keep alive the very ‘division’ of both the companies, they propagated that the merger was a futile exercise and that eventually there would be a ‘de—merger’Following this, the integration went haywire — the process which would have been done in the first three months — could not be completed in three years,” they said.The group claimed that some officials created divisions among the union by “consistently misusing their official positions and by giving recognition to splintered minority groups in the unions as against pro—merger majorities, they sabotaged the merger badly“.“Initially, the consulting company informed that the airline would benefit around Rs. 832 crores by operational synergies alone in the first three months but even operational integration could not place and the company lost Rs. 7,200 crores in the first year, Rs. 5000 crores in the second year and the third year Rs. 5,400 crores. The cost of sabotaging the merger has caused the company a whopping Rs. 18,000 crores so far,” CAG said.The group warned that if the rhetoric of ‘de—merger’ was allowed to be propagated it would lead to a loss of Rs. 36,000 crores.Eleven recognised Air India employees unions are today holding a conference in a bid to save the airline which would be addressed by CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury and Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam.The CAG also attributed frequent change of CMDs in the last three years as a contributing factor which allowed the anti—merger conspiracy to deepen further.

Krishna while replying to supplementary questions in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.Without naming Pakistan, he said the nature of development “is only the vindication of what India has been conveying to the United States government that the epicentre of all terrorists activities comes from only one country.''He was responding to a question from Prakash Javdekar (BJP) whether India would draw the attention of the U.S. of New Delhi's concern over terror emanating from Islamabad in the light of the last week's incident. Authorities in New York arrested Pakistan born U.S. citizen Faisal Shahzad for leaving a vehicle behind in the Times Square to explode.The Minister said the incident strengthened India's assessment that the U.S. would understand the reality that a terror attack could emanate from anywhere and strike at any place.To questions on India's stand on the U.S. plan to supply drones to Pakistan, the Minister said New Delhi had recounted its past experience and cautioned Washington to constantly monitor how the military equipment supplied to Islamabad was being used.Mr. Krishna said whenever there were high-level exchanges between India and the U.S. “we invariably point out our experience in the past and then the possibility of the lurking dangers'' over India's head.The U.S. had promised it was closely monitoring how military aid given to Pakistan is being used and New Delhi's concerns would be kept in mind.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lsquoFaisal-arrest-in-United-States-vindicates-Indias-stand/article16298989.ece

Besides a GJM delegation, officials of the Union Home Ministry and the West Bengal government will be attending.The talks are being viewed as precursor to another round of political level discussions slated for later in the month.Though the West Bengal government is amenable to the idea of an alternative administrative set-up with greater powers than what the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) was invested with it is opposed to the jurisdiction of such a body extending beyond the three hill-subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong. It also favours constitutional status to such a set-up.The issue of jurisdiction is of greater importance to the GJM leadership presently than the powers it demands for the interim set-up, GJM sources said.While the West Bengal government has ruled out any bifurcation of the State for the creation of a separate “Gorkhaland,” State regional parties in the Darjeeling hills like the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League and the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists have been increasingly strident in their criticism of the GJM.According to them, it is allegedly settling for a “regional authority” rather than pursuing its professed agenda for a separate State.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/GJM-threatens-agitation/article16298975.ece
1255,Political parties double efforts to woo Thakurs in Uttar Pradesh,Atiq Khan,2010-05-07,02:34:07 IST,"Political parties in Uttar Pradesh have doubled their efforts to woo the Thakurs or the Kshatriyas, who constitute roughly about three to four per cent of the electorate and are considered to be the “floating vote.”Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has taken the lead in this regard by constituting a three-member committee, comprising three Thakur Ministers — Vinod Singh, Badshah Singh and Jaiveer Singh, to enlist the support of their kinsmen for the BSP.Not to be left behind, several senior Thakur leaders in the Congress are expected to be present at the Maharana Pratap birth anniversary celebrations in Lucknow on May 9. While the former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and the All-India Congress Committee general-secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, is the chief guest, Sultanpur MP Sanjay Singh has been designated as chairman of the gathering. Banda MLA Vivek Singh and former party MP from Azamgarh Santosh Singh are other invitees.The Rajputana warrior-king's birth anniversary celebration is being organised by the Maharana Pratap Jayanti Aayojan Samiti. The samiti had invited the former Bharatiya Janata Party president, Rajnath Singh, as the chief guest when he was the Chief Minister in 2001.On Mr. Digvijay Singh being chosen as chief guest, convenor Vakil Singh said: “The samaj (community) wanted Mr. Digvijay Singh as the chief guest at the warrior-king's birth anniversary celebrations this year.” He denied that the committee was a political forum, though sources in the Pradesh Congress Committee said there was nothing wrong in wooing the Kshatriyas.Unlike other caste components of the State's electorate, chiefly the Brahmins and Muslims, the Thakur vote is scattered. It is in the Avadh region, synonymous with the erstwhile principalities, the rajas and maharajas, and the landed gentry, where the Thakurs have an established presence.According to rough estimates, there are almost 40 to 50 Assembly seats where the Thakur vote may prove to be crucial.The Samajwadi Party was in the reckoning for the Thakur-support till former general-secretary Amar Singh was expelled by party president Mulayam Singh.Since then, Mr. Amar Singh has formed the Lok Manch, which he claims, is a apolitical organisation.He is touring different parts of the State to muster the support of the Kshatriyas, Muslims and the Most Backward Classes.In the recent past, the former SP general-secretary was the chief guest at several functions organised by groups claiming to represent the Kshatriyas.SP sources said Mr. Mulayam Singh is unsure of Thakur support as a long-term political option.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Political-parties-double-efforts-to-woo-Thakurs-in-Uttar-Pradesh/article16298968.ece

1258,"Centre misusing CBI to defame Modi, says BJP",Neena Vyas,2010-05-07,02:27:28 IST,"For the first time since the Supreme Court decided to get to the bottom of the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, the Bharatiya Janata Party has come to the defence of Chief Minister Narendra Modi.It described Sohrabuddin as one who was “spreading terror” and associated with the “Dawood and Latif” gang of criminals.After the “encounter” was staged in 2005, the “story” given by the Gujarat police was that Sohrabuddin was out to kill Mr. Modi and that his plan was foiled after he was killed in an encounter.Apparently, it was at a meeting at senior BJP leader L.K. Advani's residence early in May that Mr. Modi asked partymen to focus on the Central Bureau of Investigation rather than go on talking about the prices of dal and wheat.The BJP decided to hit out at the United Progressive Alliance government for its alleged misuse of the CBI ahead of the voting on the cut motion in the Lok Sabha, but it would seem that the larger intent was to defend Mr. Modi. The cut motion was defeated on April 27, and the next day the CBI arrested senior Gujarat IPS officer Abhay Chudasma in the Sohrabuddin case.The BJP said the UPA had used the CBI to arm-twist leaders of the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal into deserting the Opposition-sponsored cut motion. The first to make this charge was Arun Jaitley, who issued a statement to this effect on April 27, but he did not mention the Gujarat cases.Following the cut motion vote, the allegation was repeated by several party leaders including Sushma Swaraj and Gopinath Munde. It was about the same time that Mr. Chudasma was arrested, setting off alarm bells in the party.On Thursday, the party leaders, led by Mr. Advani, sat in dharna in the Parliament House complex to protest the “misuse of the CBI.” Separately party president Nitin Gadkari issued, from Goa, a three-and-a-half page statement on the subject, of which nearly two pages were devoted to defending the Modi government's record.His case was that there had been many more encounter deaths in other States — Uttar Pradesh headed the list — but the UPA was going after the Modi government.“The CBI is being misused to suppress [the truth] and defame the Chief Minister. The State of Gujarat is being punished for electing the BJP in successive elections,” Mr. Gadkari said.He said the UPA government had taken an “extraordinary interest” in entrusting the encounter killing case to the CBI after the Gujarat police filed charge sheets against several senior police officers.”“Sohrabuddin was earlier accused of spreading terror and was arrested … 24 AK-56 rifles …. were recovered from a well in the fields belonging to Sohrabuddin.”The issue was also raised in the Rajya Sabha by some BJP members. In the Lok Sabha, Ms. Swaraj was listed to speak on the working of the CBI on Thursday, but it could not be taken up for lack of time.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Centre-misusing-CBI-to-defame-Modi-says-BJP/article16298961.ece

1260,Call for Asia-Pacific nations to invest more in social sector,Aarti Dhar,2010-05-07,02:13:06 IST,"A United Nations report has called upon governments in the Asia-Pacific region to increase social spending to consolidate the region's stronger than anticipated economic rebound and to spur over the long term a fairer, more balanced, and sustained economic recovery.The Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2010, an annual publication of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) released globally on Thursday provides the governments of the region — representing 62 per cent of the world's population — a roadmap towards a more inclusive and sustainable development path.According to the survey, even at the height of this crisis, Asia-Pacific was still the fastest-growing region, supported in large part by fiscal stimulus packages adopted by the region's biggest economies.The report finds the outlook for 2010 has improved significantly, with the region's developing economies forecast to grow by 7 per cent, led by China (9.5) and India (8.3).However, rising inflationary pressures, especially of food products, and asset price bubbles, in a number of countries make 2010 a complex year for policy makers who will have to balance the momentum of growth with financial stability. While monetary tightening may be necessary to restrain inflationary pressures, policy makers must be cautious about withdrawing fiscal stimulus packages lest the fledgling recovery process is disrupted, it said.It also recommends the use of capital controls to moderate short-term capital inflows — the result of a massive expansion of liquidity in western countries —which has created asset bubbles, inflationary pressures and exchange rate increases in the region's developing economies.A sustained, long term development for all economies within the region will have to rely on creating new engines of growth, with greater regional consumption through increased intra-regional trade, and accelerating the development of an Asia-Pacific consumer market.Increased social spending directly supports income security for households by providing food security, education and access to health care, reducing the need by poorer families to maintain precautionary savings to protect against adversity. These families are then able to contribute more to local economies and invest more in their own development, it suggests.Also, as the majority of the region's poor lives in rural areas deriving benefit from agricultural growth, the survey recommends continued support for crop and rural development, urging a new, knowledge-intensive Green Revolution to make agriculture more environmentally resilient. Countries can also increase the development value of the agricultural sector by making it more socially inclusive: returning ownership of land and resources to farmers, especially women, and economically empowering the poor.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Call-for-Asia-Pacific-nations-to-invest-more-in-social-sector/article16298948.ece
1261,Separate facility in trains to transport undertrials?,K. Balchand,2010-05-07,02:07:11 IST,"Will the Railways soon have a separate facility for transporting undertrials?Whether or not that happens is a moot point, but the Railway Board is seized with the matter after the collision of two trains in October, when an undertrial pulled the chain in a bid to escape and another train rammed into the halted train from behind.The authorities brought up the issue at the recently held meeting of zonal general managers. According to sources, Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee has just about given her nod to the board to probe options to transport undertrials more safely so as not to cause any hardship to passengers or disrupt the movement of trains.The choice is a tough one, as providing such a facility in all trains would entail heavy cost, besides eating into space that can otherwise be utilised commercially. The authorities are presently contemplating segregating undertrials altogether to prevent them from getting access to the emergency chain or coming in contact with passengers.The authorities, however, are clear that the undertrial could not be held responsible for the October 21 accident. On the day, the Goa Express rammed into the Mewar Express near Mathura, killing 22 persons. The undertrial was being transported in the Mewar Express.Railway officials concede that his action could not be taken as an excuse for the accident, as any train can be brought to a halt for any number of reasons, including a genuine emergency.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Separate-facility-in-trains-to-transport-undertrials/article16298944.ece
1262,"Nothing unconstitutional about MPLAD scheme, rules Supreme Court",J. Venkatesan,2010-05-07,02:02:24 IST,"The Supreme Court on Thursday held that the Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme, under which every MP is allotted Rs. 2 crore a year for constituency development, was intra vires the Constitution.“A mere allegation of misuse of the funds by some MPs in itself may not be a ground for scrapping of the scheme as checks and safeguards have been provided,” said a Constitution Bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justices R.V. Raveendran, D.K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and J.M. Panchal.Writing the judgment, Justice Sathasivam said: “The information furnished shows that the scheme has benefited the local community by meeting its various developmental needs such as drinking water facility, education, electricity, health and family welfare, irrigation, non-conventional energy, community centres, public libraries, bus stands, roads, pathways, bridges and sports infrastructure. Parliament has the power to enquire and take appropriate action against erring members. Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha have set up standing committees to monitor the works.”On the contention that spending of monies on various projects had to be separately provided for by law, the Bench said: “If the Union government intends to spend money for a public purpose and for implementing various welfare schemes, the same is permitted by presenting an Appropriation Bill, which is a Money Bill, and by laying the same before the Houses and after getting the approval of Parliament, the Lok Sabha, in particular, it becomes law and there cannot be any impediment to implementing the same so long as the scheme is for the public purpose.”The Bench said: “Clearly, the MPLAD scheme does not give carte blanche to the MPs with respect to the kind of works they can recommend. The scheme falls within the meaning of ‘public purpose' aimed at fulfilment of the development and welfare of the State as reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy. ‘Laws' mentioned in Article 282 would also include Appropriation Acts. A specific or special law need not be enacted by Parliament to resort to the provision. Thus, the MPLAD Scheme is valid as Appropriation Acts have been duly passed year after year.”The Bench said: “Even though MPs have been given a seemingly executive function, their role is limited to ‘recommending' works and the actual implementation is done by local authorities. There is no removal of checks and balances since these are duly provided and have to be strictly adhered to under the guidelines of the scheme and Parliament. Therefore, the scheme does not violate separation of powers.”Further, “panchayat raj institutions, municipal as well as local bodies have not been denuded of their role or jurisdiction as due place has been accorded to them by the guidelines in the implementation of the scheme.”The Bench said: “The court can strike down a law or scheme only on the basis of its vires or unconstitutionality but not on the basis of its viability. When a regime of accountability is available in the scheme, it is not proper for the court to strike it down, unless it violates any constitutional principle.In the present IMLAD Scheme, an accountability regime has been provided. Efforts must be made to make the regime more robust, but in its current form, it cannot be struck down as unconstitutional. The scheme does not result in an unfair advantage to the sitting members of Parliament and does not amount to a corrupt practice.”The Bench dismissed all writ petitions filed by Bhim Singh and others as well as transferred cases.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Nothing-unconstitutional-about-MPLAD-scheme-rules-Supreme-Court/article16121962.ece

Union Minister of State for Water Resources Vincent Pala said this in a written reply in Rajya Sabha.The NCA, chaired by the Union Water Resources Secretary, gave instructions in 2008 that the next stage of construction at the dam would first be considered in the Environment and Rehabilitation and Resettlement sub-groups, after consultation with the Grievances Redressal Authorities set up in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.So far, the environment sub-group had “conditionally permitted” construction of the spillway piers to its full height and the installation of gates (to be kept in raised position). Approval from the Rehabilitation and Resettlement sub-group is yet to be obtained, the Minister added.In its order on a writ petition filed by the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), the Supreme Court said in 2000 that the NCA would give permission to raise the height of the dam from time to time “after” it obtains “clearances” from the Rehabilitation and Resettlement sub-group (including consultation with the three Grievance Redressal Authorities of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra) and the environment sub-group.

Chauhan said: “As regards the implementation of the NHRC Report, the government is directed to file a detailed report as to what steps have so far been taken regarding the registration of various criminal cases and the progress made in the various criminal cases which are already pending in courts.”The Bench said: “The State would also respond to the suggestions made by the petitioner [Nandini Sundar] as to whether a committee could be appointed to consider the question of rehabilitation and compensation, if any, to be paid to the victims. The State shall file its response within four weeks.”When the petitioner referred to the rights violations and drew the court's attention to the plight of the people, the CJI observed: “We agree with your concern for the ordinary people in Dantewada district.”The CJI referred to the statements made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P. Chidambaram on the ongoing fight against Naxalites in the country's tribal belt. “Your PM and HM have said it's war. Is it not war?” “Who will protect them there? The government could not even take care of its own people [referring to the April 6 Naxal attack on CRPF jawans]. If something happens who will take care?”The CJI, expressing concern over the plight of the people caught in the conflict, said: “There are no schools, no primary health centres, no roads, the people are suffering. Such are the conditions.”He rejected the demand for setting up of a committee to oversee registration of police complaints, saying it was violative of the principles of criminal justice. “Criminal prosecution is not something that can be interfered with.”Ms. Nandini said that as the State government had failed to address the issues raised by an NHRC team, the court should depute a team of rights activists or independent eminent people such as the former Election Commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh, to visit those areas. “The constitution of a monitoring committee can lead to a de-escalation of conflict. It could act as a confidence-building measure. It could invite complaints (of excesses) from people and hold out an assurance of peace to the people.”The government had so far inquired into only 22 of the 114 instances of rights violations noted by the NHRC and filed FIRs on seven of them, the petitioner said.Her counsel Rajinder Sachar argued that the government had not compensated all those affected by the conflict.In her rehabilitation proposal, Ms. Nandini wanted that all affected and displaced persons given immediate humanitarian assistance, “wherever they are. In particular, they have the right to food, shelter, healthcare (including mental health care), clothing and education. There should, at the same time, be a time frame for full and voluntary return of all displaced persons in conflict situations.”The government, on its part, said “police forces” had been “blown up and their legs amputated” when they went to find out people reported missing by activists. Its counsel, Manish Singhvi, said: “The State is committed to providing compensation to all affected by violence committed by any outfit.”The matter will come up for further hearing in July.
Correction

In a report “[Supreme] Court calls for NHRC report on Chhattisgarh” (May 7, 2010), the petitioner, Nandini Sundar did not ask for the court “to send a team of rights activists to Chhattisgarh to look into complaints of rights violations” as was reported in the first paragraph. As part of the rehabilitation plan, the petitioner wanted a high level monitoring committee which would include retired civil servants or judges as well as representatives of the Government of Chhattisgarh; a survey to be carried out under the aegis of a reputed academic institution, and district judges to receive and process claims of heinous crimes.

1266,Supreme Court to examine validity of Tandon committee,J. Venkatesan,2010-05-07,01:52:55 IST,"The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would examine the validity of the constitution of the Tandon Committee set up by the Human Resource Development Ministry to go into the working of the deemed universities in the country.The Professor Tandon Committee had earlier recommended de-recognition of 44 institutions for failing to meet the prescribed standards and said that these institutions after de-recognition would be affiliated to the respective State universities.During the resumed hearing on Thursday, Justice Bhandari heading a Bench told Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam that when there were allegations against Professor Tandon himself that he was heading a deemed university and it was not appropriate for him to head the Committee, “we have to examine the whole issue.”Justice Gyan Sudha Misra was the other judge on the Bench.Assailing the setting up of the committee, petitioners had contended that the deemed varsity status could be withdrawn only pursuant to a power statutorily conferred authorising such withdrawal and in accordance with statutory regulations. The right conferred on these universities could not be restricted by executive directions issued on the whims and fancy of the government.It was pointed out that each of the 126 deemed universities was given only 10 minutes to give a presentation before the committee about their institution and the committee had determined its conclusions on nine parameters in these 10 minutes.“It is absolutely absurd that the fate of a university with thousands of students and staff and investments in crores of rupees can be concluded in such a hurried and inadequate manner.”Pointing out that the entire constitution of the committee was vitiated, the petitioners sought a declaration that the committee was without authority and its report was illegal and unenforceable. The Bench asked the government and the parties concerned to complete the pleadings and directed the matter to be listed for final hearing on August 3.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Supreme-Court-to-examine-validity-of-Tandon-committee/article16298936.ece

  Four miners were killed and 28 injured in a massive blast in the Anjan Hills coalmine in Chhattisgarh's Koriya district on Thursday.Six members of a technical team were still trapped in the mine, and rescue workers were unable to make contact with them. The mine, operated by South Eastern Coalfields Limited, an undertaking of the Coal Authority of India, is located 50 km from Chirmirri, district headquarters.“Of the 28 injured, 14 are being treated in the district hospital at Chirmirri, while 14 have been shifted to the Apollo Hospital at Bilaspur,” Collector Alok Awasthi said. “S.K. Goswami, deputy general manager, operations, was among the dead.”While the exact cause of the explosion, which occurred at about 11.30 a.m., is yet to be ascertained, Mr. Awasthi told The Hindu that it happened probably when carbon monoxide gas leaked into a mine shaft and caught fire under high pressure and temperature that prevailed in the mine.The leak and the rise in temperature were detected on Wednesday, and there was no mining operation on Thursday. In the morning, a rescue team and a technical team entered the mine for a safety check.However, they were trapped in the explosion that spewed scalding fumes to the surface.“Thirty-two miners standing at the mouth of the mine were injured,” Mr. Awasthi said, “While two died in the hospital in Chirmirri, two died en route to Bilaspur.”Rescue teams were waiting for conditions in the mine to stabilise before launching a search for survivors.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4-killed-in-Chhattisgarh-mine-explosion/article16298934.ece
1268,JPC probe sought into 2G spectrum issue,Aarti DharK. V. Prasad,2010-05-07,01:46:55 IST,"AIADMK members disrupting Lok Sabha proceedings on the 2G spectrum allocation controversy, in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.
  The 2G spectrum allocation controversy figured in both Houses of Parliament with the AIADMK members, supported by the BJP, demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the issue. They also demanded a statement from the government on the matter.In the Lok Sabha, AIADMK member M. Thambidurai asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take the issue seriously and order a JPC probe. He said Telecom Minister A. Raja should be “kept out of the Ministry'' till a JPC probe is held and the ongoing investigation by the CBI is completed.Mr. Thambidurai pointed out that the Leader of the House and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was present, had promised that the government would respond to various issues raised by the Opposition, including 2G spectrum allocation. Mr. Thambidurai was supported in his demand by BJP members.He alleged that the country had lost Rs. 1 lakh crore in the allocation of 2G spectrum during 2007-08. This led to a clash between members of the AIADMK, supported by the BJP, and the DMK.Mr. Thambidurai said the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had noted that Rs. 26,000 crore had been lost “because of wrong-doing by this [Telecom] Ministry.” He said even the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) had pointed out that Raja's policy of giving 2G spectrum on ‘first-come-first-served' basis resulted in allocation at cheap rates which was “not acceptable.”On the CVC's order, the CBI lodged an FIR under Section 120 (B) of the Cr.PC and under the Prevention of Corruption Act, Mr. Thambidurai said, adding that the CBI had subsequently raided some “benami companies.''DMK leader T.R. Baalu, who repeatedly interrupted Mr. Thambidurai, insisted that no allegations should be levelled against the Minister against whom no case has been lodged.Speaker Meira Kumar assured Mr. Baalu that she would go through the records and expunge anything objectionable. In the ensuing melee, Ms. Kumar adjourned the House for an hour.In the Rajya Sabha, the AIADMK members forced a brief adjournment before staging a walkout demanding Mr. Raja's dismissal from the Union Cabinet.As soon as the House met for the day, the AIADMK members displayed CDs and newspapers carrying purported taped conversation with Mr. Raja and public relations lobbyist Nira Radia. Chairman Hamid Ansari asked members not to show CDs or display newspapers before adjourning the House for 10 minutes. Post-adjournment the AIADMK members again raised the issue before staging a walkout.Earlier, when the Lok Sabha assembled in the morning, the BJP tendered unconditional apology for alleged remarks of its member Ananth Kumar in the Lok Sabha against Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Prasad during the Census 2011 debate.As soon as the House met for the day, Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj said: “I unconditionally apologise for the remarks made by Ananth Kumar yesterday [Wednesday.]'' When Mr. Prasad sought to intervene, Ms. Swaraj said in a lighter vein that she apologised on behalf of Mr. Prasad also.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/JPC-probe-sought-into-2G-spectrum-issue/article16298952.ece

  National Socialist Council of Nagalim leader T. Muivah, on Thursday put off his visit to his ancestral village in Manipur, even as three persons in a crowd waiting to welcome him across the border were killed in a stampede when the police fired teargas shells.Official reports reaching Imphal said the Manipur police fired teargas shells when the crowd, waiting at Mao on the inter-State border in Senapati, turned restive and burnt a vehicle of the India Reserve Battalion. The police action led to the stampede. The dead included two women.Mr. Muivah, who arrived at Viswema village from the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) headquarters near Dimapur on Wednesday, said he responded to a request by four non-governmental organisations to postpone his visit to Somdal village in Manipur's Ukhrul district to facilitate proper arrangements.The Manipur government is opposing his visit on the ground that it will disturb communal amity. But a defiant Muivah said he would visit his village.The NSCN(IM) has been demanding the formation of a ‘greater Nagaland' by merging Naga-populated areas of adjoining States, but the plea has been rejected by the Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh governments.The Naga leader said he failed to understand why the Manipur government was objecting to his visit when the Centre had given its nod. On the Manipur government clamping prohibitory orders to prevent his entry, he said Nagas must resist its “nefarious designs“.On the ongoing talks, Mr. Muivah said both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P. Chidambaram had expressed their commitment to resolve the Naga issue peacefully.Noting that the complex Naga problem might not be resolved in one-go, he advocated a step-by-step solution.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, who flew to Delhi on Thursday morning to brief the Prime Minister and the Home Minister on the situation in Manipur, returned here in the afternoon.Late Wednesday night, four Naga organisations —— Naga Hoho, NSF, NPMHR and NMA —— appealed to Mr. Muivah to postpone his visit by a few days to “facilitate proper arrangements“.Civil society, in a joint statement, said: “This visit should be a memorable and meaningful one, and we feel your life and service that you have are very important to us and the Nagas.”",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/At-NGOs-instance-Muivah-puts-off-visit-to-ancestral-village/article16298912.ece

He has also indicated that he could go to Ranchi this weekend to make a spot assessment of the situation before taking the final call.As of now, the party does not think that the JMM will come forward to support a BJP-led government. There will also be problems in the BJP if it decides to withdraw support from the Soren government as its ministers are keen to continue.Many in the party admit that the parliamentary board decision to withdraw support was taken in haste. There is the view that since such a decision was taken and announced publicly, the BJP should act on it if the JMM does not agree to give it support.It is now over a week since the withdrawal of support decision has been put on hold, making the BJP leadership's position untenable, one section of the leadership said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/BJP-likely-to-take-final-call-on-Jharkhand-soon/article16298904.ece

Hailing from Gooty town in Anantapur district, Bharat achieved the feat in his very first attempt. He finished his MBBS from Government Medical College, Kurnool recently.Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Bharat said his preparations started in the third year of MBBS when he realised that Civil Services was a better way to serve people. He attributes his success to his senior, Dr. Vamsi Krishna, who inspired him to attempt Civils.Another feature of this year's results is that several candidates who left lucrative jobs in the corporate sector cracked the exam. Moreover, lot of candidates who are already undergoing training as IPS and IRS officers have bettered their ranks.Kartikeya Goel, son of senior IAS officer, A.K. Goel, who retired recently, secured 47th rank to bag the IAS.

He also expressed serious concern over extending of seasons every year which had been adversely affecting the agricultural produce.Collector S.

Only a few progressive farmers were able to adopt new technologies. “Why can't mango farmers in Andhra Pradesh compete internationally when rubber farmers in Kerala are able to?” he asked adding that there was a need to promote different varieties of mangoes in the international market.The session had discussions on various issues pertaining to mango production and the problems being faced by farmers.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Scientists-urged-to-help-mango-farmers/article16298983.ece
1277,Arjitha Seva tickets scam rocks TTD,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,02:45:27 IST,"Even as the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTS) is grappling with the legal battle over the controversial ‘Anantha Swarnamayam' project, yet another row has surfaced in the form of a major scam in the sale of the prime Arjitha Seva tickets (paid sevas), allegedly involving some ‘insiders'.While the TTD's vigilance authorities have been on a discreet probe into the scandal on the basis of prima facie evidence confirming the operation of a racket in the sale of Arjitha Seva tickets, especially the sought-after ‘Vasthralankara' ticket, what touched off a furore was reports in the vernacular print and electronic media which eventually caught the attention of Chief Minister K. Rosaiah.Apparently shocked over the magnitude of the scam, the Chief Minister spoke to TTD Executive Officer I.Y.R. Krishna Rao over phone on Thursday to get a first hand report on the operation of the well-entrenched racket which according to preliminary reports involved a sum of Rs.125 crore. Besides asking the E.O. to expedite the probe and bring to book all those involved, Mr. Rosaiah also suggested certain guidelines which were to be strictly followed with ‘immediate effect' in the sale of Arjitha Seva tickets.“We are immediately enforcing all the prescriptions of the Chief Minister,” said Mr. Krishna Rao at a hurriedly convened press conference on today to explain the fire-fighting measures being initiated by the TTD to rationalise the sale of prime tickets and also to go on the trail of the scamsters.According to preliminary investigations, the modus operandi of the racket, comprising influential middlemen, politicians, representatives of some leading industrial houses besides some TTD ‘insiders' had been to buy tickets on benami names of all the prime sevas such as Vasthralankara Seva, Abhishekam, Thomala, Archana, Suprabhatham etc from out of the 50 per cent ‘discretionary quota' earmarked for VVIPs, using their clout with the powers that be in the TTD, allegedly on a quid pro quo basis.The worst-hit was the sale of Friday ‘Vasthram' tickets whose price was only Rs.12,500 if officially booked in advance (it is already booked up to the year 2032) and Rs. 50,000 if officially sold out of the ‘discretionary quota'. This was said to be the breeding source for the scam.Reports said the price of the ticket secured under ‘discretionary quota' used to go as high as Rs.1.25 lakh to Rs.1.5 lakh depending on the demand and the ‘soundness' of the ‘party'. Same was the case with other tickets.The EO said as pointed out by the Chief Minister, the TTD would henceforth insist on production of photo ID card by the ticket holders for all the Arjitha Sevas including ‘Abhishekam' so that ‘proxy' system was curbed.As another measure, each devotee would be issued the prime Vasthram ticket only once a year and tickets already booked by the same devotee more than once in a year would be cancelled immediately.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Arjitha-Seva-tickets-scam-rocks-TTD/article16298981.ece

Association representatives, who interacted with the committee headed by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, explained how Telangana literature or writers from the region did not find a mention in the text books published by the government.They also alleged that the region has not got its due share of exposure in the cultural and literary fields, while pioneers of Telangana region including poets and writers have been discriminated by Andhra and Rayalaseema leaders. The language used in the textbooks was devoid of the Telangana flavour and students from the region were put to hardship in learning a form of Telugu which was ‘alien' to them. On the cultural front, Telangana dialect had been made a language of villains and jokers in films and the people of the region were forced to face derogatory remarks about their language by ‘pundits from seemaandhra'.Association convenor S.

Girls, as usual, outperformed boys. Among the 22, are three government schools, including the Government School for the Deaf and Blind.Students in Mysore city fared relatively better than their rural counterparts, with Mysore South taluk topping the list with a pass percentage of 72.32.

1281,‘Action plan will give thrust to national policy on HIV/AIDS',Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,03:09:51 IST,"“A committee could be formed to come up with an action plan to implement the national policy on HIV/AIDS and World of Work,” said Ramesh B. Zalki, secretary, Department of Labour.“The committee, which could include experts and representatives from unorganised sector trade unions, could help us create a road map,” he added while speaking at the State-level workshop on National Policy on HIV/AIDS and World of Work, organised by Department of Labour and Population Services International's Project Connect, here on Thursday.Welcoming the national policy, Mr. Zalki said the committee should come up with an action plan in one month's time.“Through the action plan, we could ensure that workers with HIV do not lose their jobs, and help create a conducive environment and support systems for the workers.The labour officials should spread the message in their respective areas. The recommendations of the committee could be implemented in July,” he said.Mr. Zalki said the policy is based on the 10 guiding principles of the International Labour Organisation's Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and World of Work.“Due to the social culture here, people, even those who use contraceptives, are not open about it. Even purchasing contraceptives from medical stores is done with some hesitation and awkwardness,” he said. He suggested that Condom Vending Machines could be installed in hotels and dhabas (eateries) across the State. Divya Verma, Senior Programme Officer, ILO's Sub-Regional Office, said that effective collaboration and implementation of the national policy would protect the Indian working population and mitigate its social and economic impact. She later spoke about the relevance of workplace policies and lessons from policy development, dissemination and implementation.M.S. Ravishankar, Commissioner, Department of Labour, said that it was now time to draw a road map with definite milestones to ensure non-discrimination of workers and continued care and support.He also suggested that larger companies, as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility, should adopt certain towns and take up active programmes, such as opening of ART centres and prevention programmes.Atul Kapoor, programme director, PSI, spoke about Project Connect.He said the ILO and Revised National Tuberculosis Control Project (RNTCP) are technical partners on the project, which is supported by United States Agency for International Development (USAID).Anand Rudra, project management specialist, USAID and Gurudas M.

1283,Anganwadi workers make DC taste ‘substandard' food,Staff Correspondent,2010-05-07,03:06:58 IST,"Anganwadi workers and their assistants organised a novel protest here on Thursday to highlight that the quality of ready-to-cook food provided to children and pregnant women, as part of a nutrition programme, was substandard.The protesters cooked food from a packet supplied by the Government under the Integrated Child Development Scheme . Then, they requested Deputy Commissioner B. Shivappa to taste the food .Police officers, presspersons and members of the public also tasted the food and concurred with the protesters. .The protesters had gathered under the banner of the Bellary district unit of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers and Assistants' Federation, affiliated to the All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).The stir was part of a Statewide agitation called by AITUC.Arkaani, president of the district unit of the federation, told The Hindu that the Government had brought in changes to the food kit supplied under the three-decade-old programme. As a result, the kit contained powdered grain with oil mixed in it, instead of foodgrains, she noted.Ms. Arkaani suspected that either the contents in the packets had become old or sub-standard grain could have been used by the agencies that had been awarded the contract, resulting in the contents turning bad.“Children and pregnant women have been rejecting the food served to them in the anganwadi centres,” she said. This had defeated the very purpose of the Government programme, she added.In a memorandum submitted to the Governor and Chief Minister, the anganwadi workers urged the authorities to stop the supply of ready-to-eat food and restore the earlier system of supplying foodgrains. If this was not done, the beneficiaries might stop coming to the anganwadi centres, resulting in the closing down of all centres and rendering 1.08 lakh workers and assistants jobless, they warned.General secretary of the district unit of the Communist Party of India K.

  The Indian science community has for long contended with one discomfiting statistic: a staggering 60 per cent of women with Ph.Ds in science do not make it to research positions in science institutes.The reason, as conventional perception had it, was that women scientists were overwhelmed by family responsibilities, particularly after childbirth, and pressured to drop out of research.But a new study presents a different picture of the Indian woman scientist — as someone with formidable tenacity and ambition, who ensures she balances career and family, working longer hours than her male counterpart, and proactive about keeping herself updated.The proverbial “glass ceiling” that cuts short women's careers in science comes not from family, but largely from a systemic bias at the institutional level, finds the report titled “Trained scientific women power: How much are we losing and why?” co-authored by Anitha Kurup, Associate Professor; Maithreyi R., Research Associate at the National Institute of Advanced Studies; and Rohini Godbole, Professor at the Indian Institute of Science and Chair of the ‘Women in Science' panel of the Indian Academy of Sciences.The three-year-long project created a database of 1,985 women with a Ph.D. in science, engineering or medicine in the 30 to 60 age group. The survey covered 568 women scientists and 161 men scientists in research. The women were divided into three categories: those engaged in research; those in undergraduate teaching, managerial or temporary research posts; and women scientists presently not working.The majority of unemployed women Ph.Ds said they “did not get jobs” (66.7 per cent). “Family reasons” was cited by only 3.3 per cent as the main reason for not working. This lack of job opportunity underlines the need for transparency in the selection procedure at institutions, and also the importance of gender audits, says the report. A mandatory — and publicly displayed — gender break-up of staff, faculty and students would aid the process of increasing recruitment of women in science, it adds.As many as 85 per cent of all women said they successfully balanced work and family, many of them choosing to negotiate “winding career paths” in an attempt to stay on the research track after childbirth. Interestingly, 13 per cent of women in research had chosen to remain single, compared to just three per cent of their male counterparts.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lsquoWomen-scientists-face-systemic-biases/article16298901.ece
1286,Headscarf row: principal suspended,Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,20:31:14 IST,"The principal of Believers' Church English Medium School at Gurupuram, who issued a transfer certificate to a Muslim girl student allegedly for wearing a headscarf to school, has been placed under suspension by the school management. However, the parents of the student have refused to accept the suspension and have threatened to move court if the principal was not sacked.Believers' Church Kerala secretary Fr. Williams informed the decision to suspend the principal at a meeting convened to sort out the issue here on Friday by District Collector P. Venugopal. Fr. Williams said the church authorities did not know about the issue of the transfer certificate and that they were not informed about it at any stage. The principal's act, they said, had questioned the very credibility of the church, he said.Talking to reporters after the meeting, Fr. Williams said there were several Muslim students in various schools run by the Believers' Church, and nowhere did any such rule banning headscarves exist. Apartfrom suspending the principal, Mary Jessintha, the Education Committee of the church was conducting a separate inquiry and, if need be, further punitive action would be initiated. The church would also cooperate with any probe by the government and had in fact demanded that an officer of IG rank should conduct an inquiry, he added.However, Nazir Musaliar, father of the student, said the principal's act had questioned religious customs and that a mere suspension was not enough. “She should be sacked, a criminal case should be booked against her and she should be jailed. If they do not do it, we will file a case in the court and see that she gets apt punishment,” he told reporters.Mr. Nazir also said he did not intend to send his daughter to the same school, though the school management had agreed to take her back. He wanted to send her to another CBSE school in Mannancherry. The Collector had allowed time till Monday to take a decision, he said.Mr. Venugopal, meanwhile, said he preferred the student to return to the same school. But since the parents were not of the same opinion, he would help them to secure admission in the school of their choice,The principal, Ms. Jessintha, did not participate in the meeting.Church authorities said she kept away from the meeting fearing an attack against her.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Headscarf-row-principal-suspended/article16299143.ece

It was also the arena of leaders of the rival parties to incite party workers. The situation became serious after the destruction of nearly 30 flags of the CPI(M) last month by IUML workers. The retaliatory exercise of removing the flags of the rival parties continued till a peace meeting was held at the Pariyaram police station on April 29. The meeting, attended by CPI(M) and IUML leaders, decided to restore peace in the area. Peace, however, was short-lived as the rival workers resumed the attacks on party flags and flag posts on May 3.The latest outbreak of tension was over the destruction of an IUML flagpole at nearby Poyil. In a retaliatory attack, the CPI(M) flagpole at Koranpeedika was uprooted and the CPI(M)-sponsored bus shelters in the area were given a coat of green paint by IUML activists. The police on Tuesday dismantled three bus shelters and flag posts of the rival parties. Another bus shelter constructed by the CPI(M) was dismantled by a group of IUML workers. The police registered a case against nearly 70 IUML workers in connection with the case.
All-party meet
An all-party meeting convened by Taliparamba Tahsildar P. Thampan reached an understanding that political parties could erect only one party flag each at Koranpeedika. Following opposition from the police, the meeting decided that the dismantled bus shelters, if re-constructed by the rival parties, should not carry the names of the parties and should be given the colour stipulated by the municipality.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Stern-action-by-police-defuses-tension/article16299085.ece

Eight of the 17 candidates who would get allotted to various services, are from the city. In all, 34 candidates underwent training for the civil services examinations this year.Divya V.

1292,Purandeswari asks States to step up education spending,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,12:56:28 IST,"Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development Daggubati Purandeswari has urged the State Governments to step up their spending on education.This was necessary to let the “fruits of education percolate down to the last child,” Ms. Purandeswari said after opening the 20th triennial convention of Xavier Board of Higher Education here on Friday.She said that in view of the landmark Right-to-Education law and the need for expanding the education base of the nation, the education sector required a much higher fund allocation. While the Union Government had enormously increased its education allocation, the States’ contributions had actually declined over the past few years.The Centre was now allocating close to 4 per cent of its budgetary pie to education and gradually increasing the share. She wanted the States to significantly increase their shares.Ms. Purandeswari said the government wanted to set up an ‘Educational Finance Corporation’ to give financial support and loans to young people so that more of them could seek higher education.She noted that the gross enrolment ratio in the higher education sector in India was “abysmally low” at 12 to 14 per cent which was far below the international average of 23. The Planning Commission had planned to raise the ratio to 15 per cent, but this was a ‘Herculean task’ now.She said the government would dovetail the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan scheme to the Right-to-Education law. She noted that there was a 20-25 per cent shortage of qualified teachers in the higher education sector.Ms. Purandeswari pointed out that research received poor attention in India.For instance, though India was considered an IT power house, the research in the area was remarkably low. While the U.S. produced some 800 PhDs, India’s score stood at a poor 25. Children should be nudged into research while in school. Noting that a substantial section of higher education was outdated, she said the sector was “ripe for reforms.”The three-day convention, being held at Rajagiri College of Social Science, has attracted authorities of some 200 Catholic higher education institutions across the country. It will discuss the qualitative changes that these institutions needed in the coming three years.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Purandeswari-asks-States-to-step-up-education-spending/article16299027.ece

The mining law relaxes this and makes it 50 m. Many District Collectors, who are responsible for the grant of mining leases, take into consideration the mining law. The government lost a recent case in the High Court because of this discrepancy.)Replying to a special call attention motion, Mr. Thennarasu said his department was working with the Higher Education Minister, who was in-charge of mining, for a solution to ensure that the Tamil Brahmi inscriptions were protected. A committee chaired by Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudy was examining the issue. It was yet to finalise its recommendations.Mr. Thennarasu said the issue was also raised by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and that the need to protect the inscriptions was being taken seriously at the highest level. The government was of the view that the entire area where an inscription was found should be declared a protected area.D. Ravikumar (VCK), who raised the issue, warned that the Tamil Brahmi inscriptions were the only proof that Tamil was a classical language. Every single site of the inscriptions was being run over by quarries. Unless the government acted quickly, there was no way to save the inscriptions.All the main sites of the inscriptions – Keezhlevalavu, Tiruvadavur, Kazhugumalai, Melakuilkudi, Muthupatti and Kongarpuliyankulam – are almost congruent with the quarries, he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Solution-being-evolved-to-protect-Tamil-Brahmi-inscriptions/article16298941.ece

Karunanidhi said on Thursday.Five workers died and one person is still in hospital after they inhaled noxious fumes inside a sewage tank at a tannery in Vaniyambadi on Friday. They had been hired to clean the tank.Intervening on a special calling attention motion on the subject, he said from the government side Rs.2 lakh each would be paid to the next of kin. Another Rs.3 lakh each had already been disbursed from the company's side. The Chief Minister made it clear that action would be taken against those who violated laws.Most members representing political parties who spoke – T.K. Raja (PMK), C. Gnanasekharan (Congress), K. Pandurangan (AIADMK), G. Latha (CPI-M) and D. Ravikumar (VCK) – pointed to the lack of inspections and the repeated failings of the Pollution Control Board.Abdul Bahsid (DMK) wanted better pollution monitors and continuous inspections so that such incidents did not recur. Mr. Pandurangan demanded a higher compensation and jobs for the next of kin of those who died. Mr. Gnanasekharan said every year, people died of similar causes and nothing much was done. Though a common effluent plant did exist in most places, these were not enough.Mr.Raja said that both in Cuddalore and Vellore districts, the Pollution Control Board had abdicated its responsibility. He wanted the owner of the factory, where the deaths occurred, arrested.Ms. Latha pointed out that the workers did not have any protective gear when they descended into the tank.V. Sivapunniyam (CPI) faulted the lack of foresight and said that only after an accident did the establishment wake up.Gnanadoss (MDMK) said that merely giving compensation was not a permanent solution.Mr. Ravikumar said the government had to draw up a clear policy on handling sludge and sewage. The owners of the factory should not be allowed to get away lightly.Labour Minister T.M. Anbarasan said the factory had licence to process 15 lakh tonnes of goat skins each year. The sewage and sludge had chromium content and the workers did not have any protection when they went in.

1299,High-tech “corporate strategy” to mark anti-Nitish Kisan Mahapanchayat,Staff reporter,2010-05-07,20:12:03 IST,"The considerable marketing skills of Bihar’s politicians would put any sharp salesman to shame, as the elaborate preparations for the upcoming anti-Nitish “Kisan Mahapanchayat” on May 9, translate like a veritable sales procurement blueprint.For every major leader behind this “Mahapanchayat” has been handed with a “business procurement target” – that of gathering a sizable amount of followers from his allotted area.It is as well, for this “show of strength” is in reality, a do-or-die situation for the many of the dissidents and the Opposition leaders, as they struggle to stay politically credible and relevant.The five major dramatis personae in his high-stakes “credibility” play to be held in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan include JD (U) dissidents and bitter Nitish critics Rajiv Ranjan Singh “Lallan” and Prabhunath Singh, LJP’s Surajbhan Singh, RJD’s Akhilesh Prasad Singh and ex-JD (U) MP Digvijay Singh.The chief objective of this rally - which is being staged by dissidents within the ruling Janata Dal (United) and prominent leaders in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) - Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP) combine - is to protest against the state government’s allegedly anti-farmer measures while provoking Mr. Kumar to comment on the contentious issue of ‘bataidar’ (sharecropper) rights in this critical election year.According to informed sources within the Mahapanchayat, the five stalwarts have divided between themselves a “target” of gathering a minimum of 30,000 upper-caste Bhumihar and Rajput farmers from 24 state districts.Similarly, lesser leaders have been asked to gather at least 15,000 supporters from the remaining 14 state districts.“Sunday’s rally will be the biggest ever to be held in Bihar in the last 20 or 25 years,” said RJD leader and former Union Minister, Mr. Akhilesh Prasad Singh, speaking to reporters today.“This rally is for the benefit of the state’s farmers. He [Nitish] must clarify his stand on the ‘bataidar’ issue,” remarked ex-MP Prabhunath Singh, who has a dozen criminal cases pending against him.If not anything, this massive ‘anti- Nitish’ ganging up certainly is a hyper-tech savvy affair indeed.As part of the aggressive campaigning, the Mahapanchayat’s media cell has flooded the farmers’ mobiles and mailboxes with text messages and electronic mails, inviting them to the rally.The logistics strategy is no less impressive as the planners have arranged no less than 35,000 private vehicles – SUVs, tempos, smaller cars - to ensure that their claques reach the venue on time.“We have also arranged for 3 special trains to ferry farmers from all over the state,” said Mr. Akhilesh Prasad Singh.Incidentally, the Left opposition too has started work in earnest with a massive rally organized by the Left parties coming up on May 10, a day after the Kisan Mahapanchayat.Their objective is to attack the Nitish Kumar government on exactly the opposite issue – non-implementation of the ‘bataidari’ bill.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/High-tech-ldquocorporate-strategyrdquo-to-mark-anti-Nitish-Kisan-Mahapanchayat/article16299097.ece

1301,Merciless Australia pounds India into submission,S. Dinakar,2010-05-07,22:43:29 IST,"Australiian opener David Warner drives for a six during the Super Eight Twenty20 Cricket World Cup match against India in Bridgetown, Barbados, Friday, May 7, 2010.
  Undone by the Australian quicks on a juicy Kensington Oval pitch, India hurtled to a 49-run defeat in a Group `F' match of the ICC World Twenty20 Super Eights here on Friday.India, fatally, went into the contest a paceman short and then its batting floundered against some high quality fast bowling from Dirk Nannes and Shaun Tait.Only Rohit Sharma, getting on top of the bounce and striking the ball with timing and confidence, defied with a 46-ball unbeaten 79 as India chased a daunting 185.Even as wickets fell around him, the wristy Rohit displayed character.He pulled Mitchell Johnson for the maximum, struck Shane Watson over the long-off fence, whipped Nannes over the long-on ropes and waded into leg-spinner Steven Smith. His was a brave effort in vain.India was rocked early by the pace duo of Nannes and Tait. The side's old failing against the short-pitched stuff from the quicks was evident again.The red hot Nannes, working up real pace from a left-armer's testing angle, took out Murali Vijay in the third over when the batsman got a leading edge attempting to work one off his legs; the ball got to him faster than expected.In the same over, Nannes prised out the left-handed Gautam Gambhir on the pull stroke. The sluice gates had been opened.The speedy Tait gave little respite from the other end. IPL hero Suresh Raina looked like a cat on a hot tin roof on this bouncy track. The southpaw miscued a pull – the ball climbing into him a touch too quickly – and was walking back.Nannes then fired out the left-handed Yuvraj Singh with a scorching yorker. India was reeling at 23 for four after five overs. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, forced to target leggie Smith, holed out. And Yusuf Pathan fell to a brilliant catch by David Warner at deep point when he sliced left-arm paceman Johnson. India was 42 for six after nine overs. There was going to be only one winner in the contest.India, which opted to field, got the composition of its attack horribly wrong. It was incomprehensible why the side did not pick a third paceman in the eleven on a Barbados pitch.If Vinay Kumar - a crafty paceman well-equipped for Twenty20 cricket - is not fielded even in an emergency situation caused by the injury to Praveen Kumar, then what is the point in bringing him to the Caribbean?By retaining left-arm spinning all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and including an additional batsman, the Indians were a bowler short as well. This was a largely defensive ploy.Jadeja was dismissed for six successive sixes - off his last three deliveries of the fourth over and the first three balls of the tenth over - by Watson and David Warner.He pitched short at Watson, who was brutal with his trademark pulls. And then he bowled predictable length deliveries to the left-handed Warner, who bludgeoned the ball between long-on and mid-wicket.The Indians were paying the price for faulty selection.Jadeja had earlier grassed a hard catch at square-leg to reprieve Watson (on seven) off Harbhajan Singh.The experienced off-spinner, who operated with the new ball, varied his pace and trajectory and switched his line capably to the right-left combination. The others struggled.Watson, a terrific batsman on bouncy tracks, excelled his horizontal bat strokes. He picked the length in a jiffy and was ready with his response.Left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan was dismissed over the long-on fence by Watson. Australia and Watson seized the initiative even as Zaheer struggled to slip into a rhythm.Warner rocked from the other end. He is a powerful southpaw with terrific bat speed. He is someone who hits through the line - unmindful of the length - banking on his strength to muscle the ball over the field. The left-hander's six over long-off off Zaheer was a awesome strike.Australia, gaining momentum, was 53 for no loss after the six overs of field restrictions.The openers continued to pound the bowling. The fielders were forced to watch the flight of the ball into the stands.The breakthrough was achieved against the run of play. Watson (54 off 32 balls) reached his half-century swiping Yusuf Pathan over the mid-wicket fence and was bowled attempting a similar stroke. Theopening pair had put on 104 in only 10.5 overs. Warner (72 off 42 balls) continued relentlessly, striking Yuvraj Singh's left-arm spin for sixes in the arc between long-on and mid-wicket before being snared outside the off-stump by a delivery of extra bounce.David Hussey (35 off 22) biffed a few weighty blows during an entertaining cameo. However, the Indians came back strongly in the last two overs with left-armers Zaheer and Nehra giving little away.Australia made only eleven runs off the last two overs and just five from a superb last over of short-of-a-good length deliveries and yorkers from Nehra.But then, the Aussies had inflicted too much damage earlier.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Merciless-Australia-pounds-India-into-submission/article16299141.ece
1302,Impressive South Africa faces confident England,PTI,2010-05-07,15:06:49 IST,"With each of them having two points in the kitty, both the Englishmen and Proteas will be aiming to continue with the winning momentum and inch closer towards a semifinal berth.
  It will be a battle of equals when a confident England locks horns with title favourite South Africa in a Group E Super Eight match of the Twenty20 cricket World Cup at the Kensington Oval here on Saturday.While England defeated Pakistan by six wickets in their first match of the Super Eight stage on Thursday, South Africa also produced a clinical performance to get the better of New Zealand by 13 runs in the other match of the day.Neither batting nor bowling is a worry for England, which rode on Kevin Pietersen’s sizzling unbeaten 70 to defeat Pakistan and the team will expect another crackling performance from the experienced cricketer.England have an dependable opening pair of Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter, who can give a solid foundation while there are batsmen like captain Paul Collingwood and Eoin Morgan to support Pietersen in the middle-order.Their bowling has been equally impressive so far in the tournament.Ryan Sidebottom makes the batsmen’s life miserable with his consummate line and length, while Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad have the ability of producing some timely breakthroughs in the middle overs.On the other hand, consistency is the main strength of the South African batting department, which includes star all-rounder Jacques Kallis and the experienced Herschelle Gibbs.Captain Graeme Smith is coming up in the order, while the rest of line-up also has power-hitters like AB de Villiers, Albie Morkel and Mark Boucher who can pull the team out of the pit in case of any early slip-up.Their bowling line-up is also ready to give the English batsmen some tough time.Charl Langeveldt has proved his mettle with the new ball on several occasions and he will get support from speedster Dale Steyn and medium pacer Andre Botha.At times Smith would also like to take the help of Kallis who can fetch from his wide experience to produce required breakthroughs.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Impressive-South-Africa-faces-confident-England/article16299034.ece

We are working hard but right now I don’t know why we are missing opportunities,” Afridi said.",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Waqar-frustrated-with-Pakistan-fielding/article16299033.ece

  South Africa closed out the match with finesse after its batsmen had powered the side to a strong total. In pursuit of 171, New Zealand never really threatened to win. Behind in the run-rate for most part, the Kiwis fell short by 13 runs in a critical Group `E' clash of the Super Eights at the Kensington Oval on Thursday.Eventually, Albie Morkel's brutal 18-ball 40 – his innings featured five sixes – proved the difference between the sides. The South African was adjudged Man of the Match.New Zealand required Brendon McCullum to fire but the intrepid Kiwi was spectacularly held by a diving Herschelle Gibbs at cover when he flat-batted swing bowler Charl Langeveldt in the first over.The Kiwis required at least one batsman to consolidate and guide the chase but lost wickets at regular intervals from both the ends. Jesse Ryder – he top-scored with 33 – and Martin Guptill kept the side in the hunt for a phase but the pressure created by the persistent South African bowling and sharp fielding led to their dismissals. Guptil, striking with a hint of desperation against off-spinner Johan Botha, holed out. Ryder, charging Botha, was done in by flight and loop.The talented Ross Taylor threatened briefly before being wonderfully taken by Gibbs – the South African was exceptional on the field – at mid-wicket off lanky paceman Morne Morkel. The South Africans were on the ball. Dale Steyn, fast and furious, impressed in particular.Earlier, Albie Morkel's hitting was awesome. Irrespective of the length of the ball, he was striking through the line.His strong forearms and a wonderful straight swing of the willow sent the ball into the stands between long-on and long-off. The Kiwi pacemen erred by not bowling short-of-a-good-length at him. Albie thrived.Indeed, Albie and de Villiers took the game away from New Zealand. The Kiwi bowling bled towards the end after crafty left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori had bowled bowled beautifully. The last six overs fetched the South Africans a whopping 70 runs.Albie was destructive. He bludgeoned Tim Southee for three sixes in the 19th over. The Kiwi paceman, striving for yorkers, erred in his length. He was punished.The South African dismissed Southee over long-on. Then, he struck two majestic sixes down the ground.Even Vettori, well as he bowled, did not escape punishment. Albie's six off the Kiwi skipper over long-off was a clean, uncomplicated strike.Importantly, Albie picked his spots in the arena and played to his strength. de Villiers' 39-ball unbeaten 47 was a pleasing effort. The duel between the fleet-footed South African and the canny Vettori was an engaging one. The left-arm spinner altered his length while varying his pace to keep de Villiers guessing. But then, de Villiers is a versatile batsman and he collected runs with deft placements – his ability to play the ball late is his ally – and the occasional big hit.In fact, the South Africans did well as a batting group. Gibbs dazzled for a while, smacking seamer Jacob Oram for a meaty straight six and then sweeping off-spinner Niel McCullum over mid-wicket. He eventually fell top-edging an attempted swipe off the off-spinner. Jacques Kallis blazed away at the start after South Africa elected to bat. He top-edged spearhead Shane Bond for a six. He then thumped the paceman past point. Bond was not allowed to settle down.Kallis fell to a spectacular diving catch at third man by Southee after cutting Oram uppishly. Graeme Smith, whipping one, was earlier held at deep mid-wicket off Southee.This was an afternoon when the depth in South Africa's batting came to the fore. Albie was brilliant.

Brief Scores:

South Africa: 170 for four in 20 overs (AB de Villiers 47 not out, Albie Morkel 40; Jacob Oram 1/22).New Zealand: 157 for seven in 20 overs (Jesse Ryder 33, Nathan MCCullum 26 not out; Morne Morkel 2/27).",https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/Albie-Morkel-de-Villiers-star-in-South-Africas-easy-win/article16299032.ece

Wisdom is the refined form of knowledge,” he said.To become successful in one's life, he pointed out that integrity was the best honesty to oneself.“You cannot do a work for money alone. The work is to be done for the sake of work and not for material gains. Money is just a by product and becoming rich is the result of a quality in a person,” he said.He said that failures came from within. Greed and fault were the traits that bring downfall.“You have enough potential in you to become what you want to be. You can raise yourself to the level of supreme soul and enjoy the bliss.He asked, “Which is the best quality in human being? Is it the ability to move, taste, smell, see and hear? No. There are other living being on earth which also share the similar qualities, even better than us. As we are human beings, we should develop humane spirit,” he said. Mr. Rajeev pointed out that the special gift given to human beings was the power to think.The history proved that persons with good thinking capacities and communication skills had never failed.Those who spoke included College Principal M Madheswaran, Secretary K Gunasekaran, AGM, KVB S Raghunathan and R .Premanand, DRM, The Hindu, Salem.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/lsquoWisdom-is-the-refined-form-of-knowledge/article16298905.ece
1310,Court seeks details of norms for issuing look-out circulars,Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,01:27:33 IST,"The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the Union Home Ministry to file an affidavit on the existing system for issuance of look-out circulars to check arrival or departure of foreigners or Indians who have been banned from leaving or arriving in the country.Justice S. Muralidhar passed the direction on a petition by Vikram Sharma who was detained by the Foreigners' Registration Regional Office (FRRO) here in March 2008 on a request by the National Commission for Women (NCW) for opening a Look-Out Circular against him. Vikram Sharma has challenged his detention.The Commission at that time was seized of a complaint against the petitioner. The complainant had submitted before it that she had an apprehension that the petitioner might flee the country to avoid the mediation process pending before it.The Commission had sent the request for issuance of the circular when the petitioner expressed his inability to appear before it.Acting on the Commission's request, the FRRO had offloaded the petitioner at Indira Gandhi International Airport here from a flight going to Dubai.Justice Muralidhar further said the affidavit would be filed by a senior officer of the Ministry within four weeks and he would be present in the Court on July 20, the next date of hearing, for clarification.The Court also asked the Delhi Police Commissioner to file an affidavit explaining the procedure it adopts for issuance of the circular.In addition to the Ministry, the Delhi Police had also made a separate request for issuance of the circular which was later withdrawn.The police would also reply to a contention by the petitioner that his case was unnecessarily transferred from the Crime Against Women Cell to the Anti-Extortion Cell.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Court-seeks-details-of-norms-for-issuing-look-out-circulars/article16298919.ece
1311,‘State of malnutrition in Delhi worse than sub-Sahara',Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,01:26:28 IST,"“With Delhi having a malnutrition rate of 47 per cent among the urban poor and 35 per cent in the city, the rate of malnutrition is far worse than even sub-Sahara,” stated experts at a consultation on “Declining quality of life of the young child in Delhi' organised by non-government organisation Delhi Forces in the Capital earlier this week.The consultation follows a Jan Sunvai, a collaborative effort of Delhi Forces and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights.Speaking on behalf of the five-member jury of the Jan Sunwai, Dr. Vandana Prasad said they were shocked at the plight of people residing in the three bastis in Delhi -- Kirby Place, Dwarka and Jhareda.“There is a gross denial of basic rights and these ranges from lack of electricity and water supply in the permanent settlements, denial of payment of minimum wages and children's rights to survival, protection and development. Also none of the persons here had ration cards, only one person had a below poverty line card and there are no anganwadi centres at these places,” Dr. Prasad said.At the Jan Sunvai, an independent jury of eminent persons hears complaints of women from urban poor settlements of South-West District of Delhi. The jury comprised people from various sectors including non-government organisations, media and the government.Chairing the jury Mr. Amod Kanth said: “Out of the several lakh population that resides in the slum nearly 50 per cent include children. It is indeed a matter of great shame that the needs of such a large segment of neglected and deprived section of the population are not being addressed.''The Jan Sunvai also released two studies: “Situational analysis of young child in Delhi: A citizen's report” and a survey conducted by Delhi Forces in 21 bastis with a sample of 4,600 households.Sharing the findings of the jury, Dr. Vandana Prasad said: “ The Government is violating the Supreme Court orders by not providing anganwadis on a priority basis for communities that are demanding it within the stipulated period of three months. The lack of crèches on worksites is a direct infringement of the obligations the government is accountable for under the Construction Worker's Act, 1996. The jury also found that discriminatory practices relating to access, quality and affordability of health care are rampant across the three bastis. Children living with disability are often denied admission to schools.”In the light of all these violations, the jury recommended that in every slum, crèche and anganwadi centres must be opened with immediate effect, any authority that does not comply with the Supreme Court orders on opening anganwadi centres on the demand of the community must be duly punished, children affected by disability must be reached out and pro-active measures taken to address their issues including right to education in mainstream schools.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lsquoState-of-malnutrition-in-Delhi-worse-than-sub-Sahara/article16298918.ece
1312,BJP protest against water crunch,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,01:24:51 IST,"Wondering why the summer action plan of the Delhi Jal Board for 2010 has still not been released when lakhs of residents across the city are facing an acute shortage of water, BJP workers led by former Sangam Vihar MLA Vijay Jolly and area councillor Mool Chand Sharma on Thursday staged a protest holding empty water pitchers near Delhi Assembly. They also charged that the water supply in Delhi was very skewed with residents in some areas only getting an average of about 30 litres per person per day while those in others were getting over 500 litres per day.The protesters, who also included Delhi BJP general secretary Pravesh Verma and Mahila Morcha president Sarita Chaudhary, demanded that water from Sonia Vihar be immediately supplied to the Sangam Vihar area. A number of residents of Sangam Vihar, Deoli Village, Deoli Road colonies, Tigri, Mehrauli and adjoining residential participated in the protest.Mr. Jolly accused Chief Minister and Jal Board chairperson Sheila Dikshit of not managing the water resources of the city properly. He charged that while people living in Outer Delhi villages and unauthorised colonies were suffering badly due to non-availability of water, in many other areas water was being supplied in abundance.Pointing to the skewed supply, Mr. Jolly said in Mehrauli areas the DJB supplies 31 litres of water per person whereas in Delhi Cantonment it supplies nearly 16 times more or 509 litres per person per day. In Lutyens' Delhi too, there was no dearth of water with 462 litres of water being supplied per person.Noting that as against a total requirement of 1100 MGD water, the DJB is able to supply only 850 MGD water in Delhi, the BJP leader said this should have prompted the department to manage the water resources better. But, he said, water leakages in Delhi were a whopping 40 MGD and even the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has pulled up DJB for poor water management, delayed projects and water leakages. Besides, he said, the percentage of contaminated water supply has increased from 0.73 per cent to 2.88 per cent leading to spread of water-borne diseases in many areas.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/BJP-protest-against-water-crunch/article16298917.ece

However, sporadic cases continue to get reported from districts and there is always a possibility of the virus making a comeback next winter, physicians maintain.To be prepared for this eventuality, authorities on Thursday launched swine flu vaccination drive among healthcare workers, who are, when it comes to fighting H1N1 virus, the first line of defence.All government hospitals including those in the districts have been given sufficient doses of the vaccine for inoculation of healthcare workers.This is the first phase of swine flu vaccination drive and, according to authorities, the second phase covering high risk groups among general public will be taken up after an indigenous vaccine is developed.The present vaccine being administered to health workers, has been imported by noted pharma giant Sanofi Pasteur.Health care workers from private hospitals, who are willing to get inoculated, can also get themselves administered with the vaccine at any of the Government hospitals, authorities said.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has supplied close to 80,000 doses of swine flu vaccine for inoculation of health workers in the State. In all, the Centre has procured nearly 15 lakh doses of swine flu vaccine for distribution all over the country.The swine flu vaccine will provide immunity for only one year because of the possibility of the virus changing its ‘nature' and turning into a more virulent form in the next few years. “In the second phase of vaccination, which could start in three to four months, pregnant women and children will be our prime targets.Because of their compromised immunity, they are susceptible to this virus and hence they will be given the indigenous vaccine,” said state swine flu coordinator Dr. K. Subhakar.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Swine-flu-vaccination-drive-launched/article16298924.ece

Anand said here on Thursday.Participating as a chief guest at traffic awareness programme organised by APSRTC here, he asked the drivers to adhere to rules to ensure smooth flow of vehicular movement. “Stringent action will be initiated for jumping red signal at junctions and stopping buses on the roads instead of at bus bays,” he said.Explaining violations being committed by auto and bus drivers in twin cities, Mr. Anand said haphazard parking at bus bays was one of the main causes for traffic gridlocks. “Auto drivers park vehicles at bus bays forcing RTC drivers to stop buses on the main roads. As a result, vehicles coming from behind come to a standstill,” he pointed out.He said awareness programmes were organised in a phased manner for the benefit of both auto and bus drivers. “It's everyone's responsibility to follow rules,” Additional Commissioner said stating CCTVs would generate pictures of violators at the junctions. Action was initiated against shopkeepers for encroaching pavements and parking spaces.Referring to representations made by bus drivers on the delay in granting bail in connection with accident cases, he assured an appropriate decision would be taken after discussing it with other officials.RTC Regional Manager (Secunderabad) A. Purushotam underscored the need for analysing driving skills to prevent accidents and added that separate training programmes were conducted for newly recruited and in-service drivers to improve their abilities.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Special-drive-against-lsquoerrant-auto-RTC-drivers/article16298923.ece

Panchan, D. Raju and C. Nayan are coming to Kochi to reap the fruits of hard labour their tribesmen have put in. The five-member team will receive a cheque from Forest Minister Benoy Viswom for the organic pepper their tribesmen have grown in the colonies of Mannakudi, Paliyakudi and Vanchivayal of Thekkady.Last year, the tribals of Vanchivayal harvested 13,006 kg of green pepper, which was cleaned and dried for export. After the drying and processing, 4,450 kg of pepper was exported. The organic export consignment earned the tribals Rs. 9.56 lakh. Eco Land Herbs and Spices, Hamburg, Germany, purchased the pepper.The Periyar Foundation functioning under the Periyar Tiger Reserve coordinated the activities including the collection and obtaining the export licence for pepper marketing. While collecting the green pepper, the foundation gives the tribals 33 per cent extra of the market rate.It was in 2008 that the first export consignment was sent from Vanchivayal tribal colony. During that time, 14,361 kg of pepper was collected and 3,825 kg was exported.Last year, bad weather rendered a portion of the pepper consignment unfit for export as moisture was detected in 371 kg of pepper. As there was not sufficient sunshine, the pepper was dried using driers. The pepper meant for export has been collected and stocked by the Forest department. Steps will be taken for auctioning this pepper, said Forest officials.This year, 15,245 kg of green pepper was harvested from Vanchivayal and 1,813 kg from Mannakudy and Paliyakudi colonies.

It is the first hospital in the Government sector in the State to go in for a quality upgrade so as to receive accreditation by the NABH.The preliminary assessment was done on January 31 and February 1 in which the hospital authorities were given a list of 64 instances of non-compliance.These include putting up proper signage, installing power laundry, incomplete case history of patients, passageway to be without hurdles, statutory fire safety, Pollution Control Board's certificate and central sterilisation for equipment, linen used in operation theatres and other procedures.A central sterilisation system at a cost of Rs. 22 lakh is being installed at the General Hospital that would be completed in a couple of days. The Government has also in principle approved setting up a sewage treatment plant, though the sanction is still awaited.All the rest of the non-compliances pointed out by NABH inspectors are not a costly affair, said Junaid Rehman, nodal officer for the hospital for NABH certification.The attitudinal change of the staff is more important in complying with most of the deficiencies pointed out by the inspection team, he said. Some of the changes that have been brought about are introducing a token system in the Out Patient Department and having nurses and nursing assistants in the OPD. Computerisation is being implemented in phases.It would take about two-three weeks training to co-ordinate all the departments into the system, said Dr. Rehman.While the ratio of patient to doctors is rather poor for the 743-bed hospital which has only 43 doctors, the deficiency is being met by doctors provided on contract by the National Rural Health Mission.There is a deficiency of specialty doctors in all the government hospitals and as such the General Hospital is deficient in specialists in General Medicine, where instead of six, there are only three doctors.Likewise other departments like Ophthalmology and Psychiatry are some of the departments that have less than the required number of specialists.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/General-Hospital-gears-up-for-accreditation/article16298929.ece

  | Photo Credit: S_RAMESHKURUP A hartal has been called in Balussery and Elathur Assembly constituencies on Friday in protest against the police lathicharge on protestors at the Kinaloor industrial park.The hartal is being backed by constituents of the United Democratic Front who alleged that the survey being conducted for a four-lane road on the Malikadavu-Kinaloor road by revenue officials was on the behest of vested interests.Vehicles are exempted from the hartal which will be from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.District Congress Committee president K.C. Abu, who visited Kinaloor on Thursday, alleged that a land mafia was behind the attempt to acquire land for the four-lane road. Top district functionaries of the Congress and Indian Union Muslim League also visited the site.IUML State general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty warned the CPI(M) that it should not resort to a ‘Singur model of development' in Kerala. He condemned the CPI(M) attitude of ignoring people's struggles.Mr. Kunhalikuttty and Mr. Abu demanded an explanation from the Home Minister on why the police assaulted the protestors without any provocation. They said action should be taken against the policemen who attacked the protestors, including women and children.District Collector P.B. Salim said in a press release that the survey would be restarted only after the anxieties of all sections was solved. He termed it unfortunate that protestors provoked the police by throwing cow-dung water and stones.Dr. Salim said the road widening was taken up because this was a major demand by prospective investors who had shown interest in starting firms there. Only five kilometres of survey could be completed on Thursday, he said.The residents of Kinaloor continue to be divided over the need for the four-lane road. While CPI(M) workers and the Kinaloor Vikasana Samiti support the survey, the opponents of the project have grouped under a Jana Jagrata Samiti.The Samiti had raised its voice at a meeting convened by the District Collector at the Civil Station. The Samiti said the people in the area had initially agreed to the land acquisition for the road widening because of the interest evinced by the Malaysian agency to build a satellite city at Kinaloor as they hoped this would provide jobs and bring development to the area.Over 200 families will be displaced in the road widening. Residents said they did not trust the promise by the government of offering them five cents of land on the roadside itself to build a new house besides a job for one member of the household at the Industrial Park.Krishnan Kallidukkal, a resident whose land was surveyed on Thursday, said he was hesitant to let go off his land. “I will lose the well which provides water to mine and five other households here. After the Malaysian company withdrew I don't understand the need for this widening.”There are also notices stuck on walls on the way to Kinaloor Park welcoming the survey for road widening. But members of the Jagrata Samiti say that those are by persons owning bigger plots for whom losing a few cents of land does not make a difference.Over 700 residents of Morikkara are also opposed to the road widening. They complain that their houses will be drowned once the elevation of the road rises as it will sandwich them between the new road and the Poonoor river.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/Hartal-in-Balussery-Elathur-today/article16298927.ece

A 100 Watt power (Wp) solar module being used for illuminating a hoarding would get a subsidy of Rs.15,000.A solar powered 1,000-Wp system to illuminate a hoarding would cost around Rs. 2.2 lakh, of which, it is eligible for a subsidy of Rs. 1.5 lakh or nearly 70 per cent of the total cost, Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency (TEDA) Deputy General Manager (Madurai Region), S.E.S. Syed Ahamed, told ‘The Hindu' on Thursday. The Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's (MNRE) ‘Solar Off-grid Application' scheme is being implemented in Tamil Nadu by TEDA. The major benefit of such a system was that it could result in saving over 4,000 units of power per year. The advertiser could recover the cost of establishing the unit within three years.He said that the TEDA would render consultancy and all technical assistance required for such ventures. “In view of the prevailing power situation, promoting such power conservation systems will be of tremendous help. Efforts are on to popularise solar power systems.”The popularity of solar power is rising in recent times due to the increased awareness of Centre's schemes such as Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission and Rooftop Power and Stand alone Small Grid-connected Power Plant .In the TEDA Madurai Region alone, which comprises 11 southern and Central districts from Kanyakumari to Tiruvarur, 43 firms have submitted ‘expression of interest' to establish SPV Grid Interactive Power Plants of capacity ranging from one to 10 megawatt. Their approval was pending for want of final MNRE's guidelines, said Mr. Syed. The application of a firm in Sivakasi to establish a 1MW SPV plant under RPSSGP had been forwarded to the TEDA headquarters, he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Subsidy-for-utilising-solar-power-to-illuminate-hoardings/article16299029.ece

He also has a hump on his back and walks with a limp. All these congenital abnormalities have not deterred 12-year-old R. Agumani of Mottamalai next to Vilacheri near here from enjoying his childhood. But if there is something he is nervous about, it is the police!The articulate and enthusiastic young boy, who can catch and throw a ball much better than any other normal child, says that he has stood witness to the numerous atrocities allegedly let loose by the police on his family members including his 13-year-old aunt whenever the men in uniform visit their locality in search of male members in connection with theft cases.“I belong to the Kuravar tribe. My father is a trader and he sells bangles, combs, toys and other such articles. The police often come to our house either in search of my father or my paternal uncle. If they are not there, they use to torture all of us. Once, my aunt was kicked with boots. The policemen also banged her head on the wall for pleading ignorance about the whereabouts of my uncle,” he recalls.Not so different is the case of sixteen-year-old A. Kalaivendan, of Maruthapandi Nagar near B.B. Kulam here, a direct victim of torture.The boy, who had just completed his X standard, claims that he and his family members were taken to a local police station on February 15 and assaulted brutally for not disclosing the whereabouts of his maternal uncle Kalmandaiyan alias Murugan.“We were tortured to the core until my uncle surrendered. However, he was ultimately killed in an encounter on February 16. After all these incidents, I was mentally disturbed and could not go to school regularly. But somehow I regained my exposure with others' assistance and appeared for the public examinations. Otherwise, things would have worsened for me,” he says with fright.Fifteen-year-old N. Vinitha of Akkaraipettai in Nagapattinam district has a different tale to narrate. Her father and elder brother, both fishermen, were allegedly tortured by the Sri Lankan Navy for entering the island nation's territorial waters. “My father could not go for fishing after that incident and the earnings of our family dropped significantly. Even my brother is yet to come out of the trauma,” she claims.The teenage girl, now in her ninth standard, wants to study law so that she could fight for the cause of victims of human rights violations. “I am deeply moved by the plight of every other person here,” she says pointing to a group of around 100 children who had gathered for a weeklong summer camp organised by People's Watch, a non-governmental organisation based in Madurai.The child victims of torture have been taught life skills at the camp titled ‘Sangamam 2010, a celebration of child rights.' They are also provided with free boarding and lodging facilities at the Mahatma Residential School campus at Alagarkovil near here for the entire camp period spanning between May 1 and 7.

  | Photo Credit: L_Balachandar Though paddy farmers in the district were dejected over a poor yield during last season, those who raised chilli this season have reasons to be happy following a good yield.Chilli is the second major crop after paddy in Ramanathapuram district. As per official records, more than 21,000 hectares have been brought under chilli crop this year. It has been raised on an average of 3,000 hectares in Kamudhi, Kadaladi, Mudukulathur and Paramakudi blocks. Farmers of Thiruvadanai, Thiruppullani and Ramanathapuram have also raised chilli in few hundred hectares. Though there were reports that pest attack dampened the spirit of chilli farmers in a few areas, the current report has indicated that the yield is better than last year.The current yield is estimated at 350 kg per hectare as against the average yield of 400 kg per hectare. It is estimated that farmers had been getting 75 percent of average yield. “If the farmers get 50 percent more than the average, we term it as a good yield. Reports from different parts of the district have indicated that farmers are getting more than 75 percent of the average yield,” said S. Rajendran, Deputy Director of Horticulture. The yield in Kamudhi, Kadaladi and Paramakudi were relatively good.The chilli crop could be successfully raised with less water. The important factor was that the field should have moisture content but it should not be flooded for more than four or five days. The chilli crop was successful this year as almost all factors, including rain, were good this year. However, farmers who raised chilli in low-lying areas said that the yield was poor due to water stagnation for a few weeks in January.A. Sathiah of R. Kavanur said he could not get a good yield due to water stagnation for a few days as his field was situated in a low-lying area.

Issues set at rest
“The judgment of the Supreme Court has set at rest numerous issues which had been raised in relation to the gas discovered and produced by RIL from the KG D6 field. RIL sincerely hopes that the clarity of findings of the judgment brings to a permanent closure the incessant distortion of facts and malicious allegations which were being levelled against the government's policies of regulating and developing the natural gas sector for the greater good of the people of India and in the interest of nation's energy security.”RIL stated that the Supreme Court has, inter-alia, held that: MoU among the family of the promoters does not bind the corporate entity RIL; the terms of the PSC shall have an over-riding effect; the parties must restrict their negotiations within the conditions of the government policy, as reflected inter alia by the Gas Utilisation Policy and EGoM decisions. While the MoU may be kept in mind during the process of renegotiation, it is clearly held that the MoU is not binding.“RIL has always held that it is bound by the provisions of the PSC and everything else would be subservient to this overriding agreement with the sovereign.

  The Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict on Friday in the case relating to ‘Reliance gas dispute' between Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) of the Mukesh Ambani group and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. (RNRL) of the Anil Ambani group, considered as one of the biggest corporate legal battles in recent years.The batch of appeals was against a June 15, 2009, Bombay High Court order that asked RIL to supply gas to RNRL at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) against the officially prescribed $4.2 per mBtu.A three-judge Bench of Chief Justice K. G. Balakrishnan, Justice B. Sudershan Reddy and Justice P. Sathasivam had reserved the verdict on December 18, 2009, after marathon arguments. Initially Justice R.V. Raveendran was on the Bench and the case was heard for few days. But he recused saying that his daughter worked for a law firm which advised RIL on global acquisitions.Thereafter, Justice Reddy was inducted into the Bench.The case pertained to RNRL's demand that it be supplied 28 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd) of gas from RIL's KG-D6 gas fields at a price of $2.34 per mBtu agreed in a 2005 family MoU.It was the contention of RIL that Central Government's gas pricing policy would prevail over any private agreement and this aspect had been overlooked by the High court in its order.On the other hand, RNRL alleged that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas was dishonest and collusive with RIL to deny RNRL its due share of gas.It contended that “any suitable arrangement” for the supply and pricing of the gas could not be subject to the approval of price by the government.It said that RNRL was entitled for 28 mscmd of gas from the KG Basin at $2.34 mBtu and though RIL was willing to supply, the government was not approving it.It said the production sharing contract (PSC) between RIL and the government entered in April 2000 was for 40 blocks in about four lakh sq. km. and the contract to supply gas between RIL and RNRL constituted less than one per cent of the gas exploration area available to RIL, “which is 336 sq. km and there are 19 wells in which exploration is taking place.” It said the policy gave full marketing freedom to the contractor to supply gas at the price he wanted.It was the Centre's argument that “the gas title is that of Government. The title only passes to the contractor under permission at point of delivery with qualified marketing freedom. RIL is no more than an agent to sell gas. Any agreement of contractor over-riding Government public sharing contract was not called for.”",https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/Apex-court-verdict-in-Reliance-case-on-Friday/article16299003.ece

In addition, the council said, the college first started offering the courses in 2008 and sought university's approval in 2009, which was against the rules.The council decided to forward its decision to the State Government.The council took the decision based on a report of a three-member inspection committee it had set up to examine the college's request for considering the three courses for autonomous status. The committee visited the college on May 3.The report tabled in the meeting said: “…the committee is of the unanimous opinion that the application for grant of autonomy for the three courses cannot be recommended. The committee opines that the college is not fit for autonomy for running the three courses.”The report said that the committee came to know that students had completed their four-semester (two-year) courses and had already appeared for the fourth semester examinations.Vice-Chancellor of the university T.C. Shivashankara Murthy presided over the meeting.Prof. Murthy said that the university could not award degrees to students of such courses because they had been designed by the college against the norms. Autonomy given to the college did not mean full freedom to design courses against the regulations of the university, he said.He wanted to know why the college did not seek the approval for the courses before starting them.With regard to the future of students, Prof. Murthy said that as they were not registered with the university, the varsity could not award them degrees. ReportThe report said that the college had not appointed qualified staff to teach the subjects that were included in the three courses. Those recruited for undergraduate courses were made to teach students in the postgraduate courses. The examination pattern adopted by the college for the three courses was not in line with the university regulations either, the report said.The college had fixed the maximum internal assessment marks at 50 for the three courses instead of 20 prescribed by the university, the report pointed out.
MA Communication
The college had two teachers with Ph.D. degrees for the postgraduate course in communication. But, basically they had been recruited to teach undergraduate students and not the postgraduate course. Of the three visiting faculty members for this course, two were not qualified. One had an MBA degree while the other had an MA in English.The report said that the marks cards issued to communication students mentioned the nomenclature of the course as Master of Communication and Media Studies instead of MA in Communication as approved by the university.The report said that the college had not recruited permanent teachers for M.Com in Applied Finance and Accounting. Five part-time teachers and two permanent teachers recruited for undergraduate courses were handling this course. One of the five part-time teachers had only a bachelor's degree and another did not have an M.Com degree, the report said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/St.-Aloysius-College-three-PG-courses-disapproved-by-council/article16298946.ece
1340,Verdict can impact ADAG's power plans,Sujay Mehdudia,2010-05-07,23:27:22 IST,"With the Supreme Court delivering its much awaited verdict on the gas dispute between the Ambani brothers, the 2-1 verdict against the younger sibling, Anil Ambani, could have an adverse impact on the outcome of its power projects, including the 7,000 MW plus Dadri power project in Uttar Pradesh.Notwithstanding the assertions by the ADAG Chairman Anil Ambani that his company would continue to pursue and achieve tremendous growth in the power sector, things looked a bit different on ground.
Dadri project
The Dadri project, hanging fire for years now, will now most likely have to buy gas at the government approved price of $4.20 per mBtu (million British thermal unit) as and when the Government makes any such allocation. The verdict has also rendered Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) as a shell company as it at present has little or no projects in hand.The Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) hinted on Friday that might sell gas from its KG-D6 fields to RNRL at $4.20 per mBtu.It also said that the tenure of gas supply would have to be drastically cut from 17 years as being sought by RNRL. This could have an impact on the long-term cost analysis on the power generation plans of its gas-based projects, which are estimated at 8,000 MW, and projections by the ADAG would have to be re-drawn and re-done in the changed circumstances.There will be no impact of this verdict on its Ultra Mega Power Projects as they are all coal-based units and already half-way through with their implementation.The Supreme Court ruled that the Ambani family MoU could not over-ride the Government's right to fix price and approve utilisation of gas and had asked the two firms to renegotiate fuel supply.“The price will be what the Government has fixed. Supplies will be subject to Government allocating the fuel to ADAG firms and the tenure of supply will have to be in line with development plan approved for the KG-D6 fields,” RIL Executive Director P. M. S. Prasad said soon after the verdict.
Family MoU
In the 2005 family MoU, RIL was to supply 28 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas to RNRL for 17 years at $2.34 per mBtu. The gas was sought by RNRL to fire its proposed 7,800 MW power plant in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh.Mr. Prasad said RIL would renegotiate the agreement in line with the Government policy.The Dadri plant might not come before three years and practically supplies could not be for more than five years and the KG basin Dhirubhai-I and Dhirubhai-II finds were to last only for nine years.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Verdict-can-impact-ADAGs-power-plans/article16299117.ece
1341,China industry hits out at telecom equipment ban,Ananth Krishnan,2010-05-07,22:12:12 IST,"Chinese industry groups have hit out at the reported restrictions on the import of Chinese-made telecom equipment, accusing India of using security concerns as a pretext for trade protectionism.The Chinese government, however, has responded cautiously to the latest brewing trade spat between the neighbours, calling on both countries to create “a sound environment for trade and investment” and to work together to meet the $60 billion trade target for this year.The restrictions on Chinese equipment were “discriminatory”, according to He Weiwen, an executive council member of the China Society for Word Trade Organisation Studies.“India cannot reject Chinese imports citing security reasons. An import ban is warranted only if the Chinese imports are hurting Indian companies,” he told the official China Daily newspaper in an interview.The State-run newspaper also quoted the head of a prominent law firm in Beijing, which handles trade remedies, as saying the move was “pure protectionism”. “The Chinese side must seek consultations and a proper way out,” said Fu Donghui, Managing Director of Allbright Law.The Chinese government's response, however, was more guarded. Asked about the restrictions, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu avoided a direct reply, instead praising the growth in bilateral trade between the two countries.“China and India should be cooperative partners of mutual benefit and win-win outcome,” Ms. Jiang said. “The two countries are exerting joint efforts to reach a trade volume of $ 60 billion by 2010. It takes efforts of both sides to expand trade and enhance cooperation. We believe trade between China and India enjoys a bright prospect.”Asked to comment on the specific case, Ms. Jiang referred the question to the Ministry of Commerce.

  Welcoming the Supreme Court verdict on the Ambani brother's gas dispute that the natural gas belongs to the nation thereby upholding the Government stand on the issue, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Murli Deora on Friday said his Ministry's stand had been vindicated.Talking to newsmen after the apex court delivered the judgment on the matter, Mr. Deora said the Supreme Court had upheld the government's right to fix price of gas and decide its utilization. “Apex court verdict upholds the fact that gas belongs to the government and the people of the country and that is what we have been saying,” he said. The court through the 2-1 verdict had maintained that the Ambani family MoU seeking to divide gas between Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) was not binding, both legally and technically.“I welcome the verdict. No matter what campaign one ran against the government, the nation is supreme,” he said without naming the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group or its Chairman Anil Ambani.The Government had moved the Supreme Court asserting its sovereign right on gas pricing and utilisation.Union Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde termed the Supreme Court verdict as “fair decision” and said that it would have no bearing on the ongoing dispute State-run NTPC and RIL.
NTPC-RIL case
“It has nothing to do with RIL-NTPC case,” he said shortly after the judgment came. RIL had in 2004 bid for an NTPC tender to supply 12 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas to the State utility at $2.34 per mBtu (million British thermal unit).However, the contract could not be concluded over differences on terms. The NTPC has dragged RIL to Bombay High Court seeking performance of the contract.Mr. Shinde said the verdict had nothing to do with NTPC's dispute with RIL.“It has nothing to do with my case of NTPC against RIL. No reference has been made on the dispute in the court judgment,” he added.He also declined to comment on the supply dispute between RIL and RNRL, saying it was a matter between two brothers.Mr. Shinde acknowledged: “I was part and parcel of the ministerial panels that first approved $4.20 per mBtu price of RIL's KG-D6 gas, fixed priority and users of the fuel and then decided to appeal against the Bombay High Court decision,” he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/Ministrys-stand-vindicated-says-Murli-Deora/article16299123.ece

  On Sunday Russia will mark the 65th anniversary of victory in World War Two with an unprecedented military parade that will see western troops march for the first time in Red Square.Military units from WWII allies of Russia — the U.S., Britain and France — have been invited to join Russian troops for the V-Day parade on May 9. Servicemen from nine former Soviet republics will also take part.Altogether the one-hour parade will see more than 10,000 troops from 20 countries march past the Kremlin and feature several types of defence equipment for the first time, including the Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile. A total of 161 tanks and missiles will roll through the Red Square.The highlight of the parade is a flyover of 127 planes and helicopters, including Tu-160 Blackjacks and Tu-95 Bear nuclear-capable strategic bombers, the world's biggest transport plane, An-124, mid-air refuelling tankers, as well Sukhoi and Mikoyan fighters.Rehearsals for the parade have been going on for the past week, shutting down traffic in downtown Moscow for several hours every day. Military parades will also be held in 70 other Russian cities, involving a total of about 100,000 troops.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Chinese President Hu Jintao are among 25 foreign leaders set to attend. Many other countries are sending in delegations to Moscow. However, India will be conspicuously absent from the Moscow celebrations in contrast with the 60th V-Day anniversary, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. It is true that in 2005 Mr. Singh came at a special invitation of then President Vladimir Putin, whereas this year President Dmitry Medvedev sent out personal invitations only to the leaders of the former Soviet states. However, all other countries were also invited to attend.The Indian Embassy in Moscow could not say why New Delhi decided not to send any delegation. All that an embassy spokesperson would say was that “the Government of India will not be represented”, in the Moscow festivities.It may be argued that India was not directly involved in the world's most destructive war. But then, Vietnam was not involved either and Israel did not even exist at the time. Yet, both states will be represented in Moscow. Besides, “several thousand Indian troops also laid down their lives” in WWII, as Mr. Singh recalled on departure to Moscow for the 60th V-Day anniversary five years ago.In his statement for the press on the occasion, Mr. Singh made it clear that he was going to Russia, not only to commemorate “the immense sacrifices made by Russia and other allied countries in defeating the forces Fascism and Nazism”, but also because “we attach the highest importance to our relations with Russia, which has been a tried and tested friend, and has stood by us in times of need”.There is no evidence to suggest that New Delhi has since revised either its assessment of Russia's contribution to WWII victory or its view of bilateral relations with Russia. India is still the most trusted strategic partner of Russia, whose arms played a no small role in defending India's independence over the past decades.Yet, no India official will be present in Red Square on Sunday to mark Russia's most sacred holiday, for which its people paid a horrendous price of almost 27 million lives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Moscow-readies-for-V-Day-parade/article16299116.ece
1347,Mauritius wants greater Indian role,Pranay Gupte,2010-05-07,23:20:47 IST,"Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun
  Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Rashid Beebeejaun says that Mauritius wants greater participation by Indian companies in developing the infrastructure of this island-nation.“Our bilateral relations have always been excellent, but we feel that there's much more room for collaboration,” Mr. Beebeejaun said in an interview with The Hindu on Friday at his modest office in the capital city of Port Louis. “We expect more interest from our friends in India in setting up enterprises here.”Besides strengthening the infrastructure of this Indian Ocean country of 1.3 million people, Mr. Beebeejaun said Indian companies could assist in such fields as renewable energy, shipping, electricity generation, and sewage-treatment.“I can personally assure you that Indian companies will be welcome in Mauritius,” the 75-year-old Deputy Prime Minister said. “But they should be more present, and more forceful. Certainly, all Indians who come here are made to feel at home. But that's only the first step. The second step is that we want them to assist us in our sustainable economic development efforts, and deliver. But hardly any Indian firms are showing much interest so far.”Mr. Beebeejaun suggested that foreign direct investment from Mauritius into India “could possibly increase”. The current FDI figure of nearly $12 million annually is the highest of any country in India, and more than three times that of the next biggest FDI provider, the United States.The FDI from Mauritius is not necessarily indigenous money but funds routed from other sources that take advantage of this country's liberal tax regulations. India, however, does not figure high on the list of countries from where Mauritius imports consumer and other products. India annually sends about $200 million worth of such goods, including cotton, to Mauritius — barely 10 per cent of this country's total imports. Imports from China exceed $500 million, and more and more Chinese tourists have also been coming here in recent years.Mr. Beebeejaun spoke a day after winning a tough race in the election for the 60-member Parliament. The three-party alliance led by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam obtained 41 seats, while 18 went to the leftist Mouvement Militant Mauricien, and one was wrested by an Islamist candidate.The Deputy Prime Minister looked fit and surprisingly relaxed for a man who had just completed a brutal political campaign. In that campaign, he was maligned by Muslim opponents as not being a faithful Muslim.Mr. Beebeejaun said he was not bothered by “false and malicious” accusations.“Some Muslims resented the fact that I did not say that I was a Muslim first and foremost,” he said. “I am first and foremost a Mauritian. I am a man of deep personal faith. I practise my religion. But I believe in sharing universal values. I believe in nation building. I participate in all national functions. I attend Chinese festivals, I attend Hindu festivals, I attend mass at churches. I feel enriched by such exposure to my country's diversity and religions.”“Mauritius is one place where we celebrate our differences,” Mr. Beebeejaun said. “As in India, Hindus and Muslims and Christians and others live together under the banner of one nation. Those who seek divide us pollute minds and create groundwork for an undesirable legacy.”He was alluding to the communalism that has long characterised certain sectors of Mauritian society, where nearly 50 per cent of the population is Hindu, followed by other communities such as Creoles, Christians, Muslims and whites of French descent known as Francos.“We seek to build in Mauritius a nation where every component of society feels part of the national spirit,” Mr. Beebeejaun said. “I belong to a government that represents all our people, and not any one single community.”Indeed, Mr. Beebeejaun added, Mauritius could point proudly to the fact that, as a nation, it had acquired a reputation for being non-ideological and nonpartisan. Noting the many friendships of his friend and boss, Prime Minister Ramgoolam, with world leaders of different political persuasions, Mr. Beebeejaun said the non-partisanship of Mauritius in world affairs offered it “independence and flexibility”.
On the international scene
There are reports that these elements may be utilised by Mauritius to amplify its voice on the international scene, perhaps through the establishment of a centre for the global south. Such a centre could consist of a think tank on strategic communications and public diplomacy, and also focus on promoting cross-cultural understanding.While Mauritius has maintained non-partisanship sine its independence from the British 42 years ago, it has also sought to strengthen economic links with other developing nations, particularly in Africa, West Asia, and Asia.In recent years, Asian giants such as China and India have figured large on the Mauritian radar. China is building an industrial city here to assemble consumer and other goods for re-export to Africa and Europe. Indian leaders visit Mauritius frequently, and Prime Ministers Ramgoolam and Manmohan Singh are known for their warm rapport.Asked how concerned he was that the growing Chinese economic presence in Mauritius is reportedly irritating India, Mr. Beebeejaun said: “Our relationship with China is not at the expense of India. We believe in friendship and cooperation with all countries who demonstrate good will toward Mauritius.”
Correction

The fifth paragraph of an article “Mauritius wants greater Indian role” (Op-Ed, May 7, 2010) was “The current FDI figure of nearly $12 million annually is the highest of any country in India, and more than three times that of the next biggest FDI provider, the United States.” The figure should have been “$12 billion”.

The first three companies to use it are TE Data, Vodafone Data and Link Registrar, said the country's Communications Minister, Tarek Kamel, hailing “a milestone in internet history”.Instead of using the old .eg domain name, organisations in Egypt can use “.misr”, written from right to left in Arabic script as the default country code for domestic websites. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also introducing the new codes, respectively “.Al-Saudiah” and “.Emarat”.One of the first of these “internationalised domain names” leads to the Egyptian Communications Ministry. If a browser has the correct fonts installed, the user should see an Arabic name. When you mouse-over or click on the link, what you see will depend on the browser. “Confusing for us, a relief for the Arab world,” commented the specialist IT site THINQ.co.uk.The move comes six months after the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann, approved the use of non-Latin domain names.The innovation is a significant moment for the internationalisation of the world wide web — half of whose users do not use a Latin script as their primary language.Arabic accounts for one per cent of all web content — though its estimated 280 million speakers constitute five per cent of the global population — but until now it has had to be hosted under Latin addresses. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/World-wide-web-launches-Arabic-URLs/article16299115.ece

Rather than attempting to realistically portray the Mahatma or Tagore, the actors pay more attention to the content of the letters. These missives reveal the ideological differences between these two greats over the freedom movement, and how the rift widened over the years. The play is directed by Vijay Padaki, an active theatreperson for over 50 years, and 1993 winner of The Hindu award for his script, Credit Titles.For the five performances in Bangalore, the role of Gandhi will be explored by Anand Ramprasad and alternately by Sanjeev Iyer and the role of Tagore by Abhijit Ganguly and Shashank Purushotham. The play will be narrated by Aparna Nori and alternately Kshema Shivakumar.The script, which is highly educational in content but entertaining nonetheless, was adapted by BLT from a manuscript by Shailesh Parekh, Tagore scholar-translator.

However, II PUC students had to wait till evening to access their results even as they were uploaded at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time.No less than 16 sites hosted the results, making it a smooth affair for students. Interestingly, Internet cafes — that are usually crowded on results day — recorded a decline in the number of students coming in. Café owners attributed this to the fact that the youngsters were using their mobile phones or logging in at home to download their results.Sanjay S., a student from the NPL Shastri PUC College, despite having scored 92 per cent, said he was disappointed. Others showed more enthusiasm and rejoiced like Anutha M., a student of Government Girls College, Malleswaram, who said she was more than happy with her first class.Not so Shweta Gopalakrishan, a student of Cambridge Indiranagar School, and her mother. The two were despondent stepping out of the cyber cafe near their home in Domlur.

So, there is a lot of work to be done here,” Mr. Ram said.Pointing to changing trends in the era of globalisation, he said: “In the old days, nationalism meant that you wanted your young people to stay home and barriers were erected to people going abroad to study, but that has changed now.”Bryan Dalton, acting Consul-General, U.S. Consulate-General in Chennai, said such fairs were crucial to help students understand the options and “find the best fit”.Pointing to an increased emphasis on international education and reasons to value it, he said U.S. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made cooperation in education and development one of the five pillars of newly defined U.S.-India strategic partnership.Apart from stalls put up by universities and education consultants, the venue also has State Bank of India's stall to exclusively focus on student loan options.Day two of the fair will also feature a series of workshops. A seminar on U.S. student visas and education counselling will be held from 10.45 a.m. to noon, while a session on Canada will be from noon to 12.45 p.m.A seminar on education opportunities in the U.K. will be held from 2 p.m. to 2.45 p.m. and one focussing on education opportunities in Holland will be held from 3 p.m. to 3.45. p.m.Sessions on education in Singapore and Germany will be held at 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. respectively.

  Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi on Friday clarified in the Assembly that there will not be any tariff hike for 'the sections of society for whom the Communist Party of India (Marxist) claimed to be working'.He was reacting to a query from CPI (M) floor leader K. Balabharathy on the tariff hike issue during the debate on the demands for grants to the Energy Department.The CPI (M) leader pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board had submitted a petition to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission for the tariff hike in respect of domestic consumers consuming over 200 units [bimonthly], small industrial units and other establishments.She also recalled the Chief Minister's statement on Thursday that there would not be any tariff hike and urged him to give up the move to increase the tariff.Mr. Karunanidhi said that the free power supply scheme for farmers and handloom weavers would continue.Replying to the debate, Law Minister Durai Murugan asserted that the State would be surplus in power during 2011-2013 as a number of generation projects, now under execution, would be commissioned.Responding to the criticism of former Electricity Minister R. Viswanathan (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) that the present government had neglected generation projects, the Minister said apart from pursuing the projects initiated by the previous AIADMK regime, the DMK government had taken the initiative to execute several projects such as Mettur Thermal Power Station – Stage III (one unit of 600 megawatt); a joint venture project with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) in Udangudi (two units of 600 MW each); and a thermal power project in Kattupalli (1,600 MW).Referring to the AIADMK's contention that there was no power cut when it was in power during 2001-2006, Mr. Durai Murugan argued that the DMK regime, during 1996-2001, had closely followed up the implementation of many projects initiated by the AIADMK in its previous spell (1991-1996). As a result, capacity addition of 1,197.57 MW was achieved. This was why there was no power cut during the subsequent AIADMK regime.When Peter Alphonse (Congress) asked the Minister to spell out the State government's plan of action to implement projects under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, he replied that the State would implement solar energy project as soon as the Centre announced its guidelines.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Karunanidhi-clarifies-in-House-on-power-tariff/article16299224.ece

Several others too received copies of the question paper in advance and some accused received monetary consideration for supplying it.According to the petitioners, a senior police officer, Radhakrishnan, the then member secretary of the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board, was an accused in both the FIRs relating to the year 2005.

Veeraswami, said they were among the chief reasons responsible for the power shortage experienced during 2009-2010. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) was forced to impose certain restrictive measures to limit the demand. Of 2,000 megawatt (MW) to 2,500 MW being procured from the market to meet the present deficit, 490 MW to 740 MW was purchased form captive power plants in the State.Giving projections of power shortage from June 2010 to May 2011, he stated that the deficit would vary from 1,400 MW to 3,400 MW during peak hours (6 p.m. to 10 p.m.); 1,700 MW to 3,600 MW during day (6 a.m. to 6 p.m) and 500 MW to 2,100 MW during off-peak hours (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.)Former Electricity Minister R.

The mock interview at the Anna Institute of Management helped her.“IAS officers P.W.C. Davidar and T. Udayachandran asked me to face the interview as an officer and answer with authentic data. Fortunately, the interview panel asked me questions mainly on rural and social schemes in Tamil Nadu.”“I am an officer now and the confidence level is high. I want to join IAS. I will be happy if I get the home cadre. My second option is Karnataka,” says Kanagavalli, who is getting married to Thanesh, an industrialist based in Bangalore.

  They come in many shapes, sizes and colours, are easy to take, and can boost your health. But if you think these pills (minerals, vitamins, and protein), or nutritional supplements can replace a balanced diet, think again. While there is no denying the significance of these nutritional supplements in specific cases, it would be a fallacy to believe that popping a pill or downing a protein shake will save you the trouble of picking your vegetables, fruits, and meats.Meenakshi Bajaj, medical nutrition therapist, at the Government General Hospital, says there is nothing yet that can replace a balanced diet. In some cases, she adds, such supplements will find a place in the doctor's prescription and then, they are essential.For instance, they are useful for crucially-ill patients, for those who are on a crash diet programme to aid wound-healing, and for those with specific deficiencies. She adds that pregnant and lactating mothers, the chronically undernourished, those on nasal feeding tubes, patients with conditions that can cause mal-absorption and the elderly will derive benefits from prescribed nutritional supplements.Sheela Nambiar, director, TFL Fitness Studio, touches on protein supplements. While a regular person requires 0.8 grams of protein per kg body weight, for someone who is training or body building it goes up to 1 – 1.5 grams.“You can get it in your diet, provided it is extremely well balanced and you can get the protein without the fat. But for vegetarians who are also body-builders, that quantity of protein is difficult to get with just their diet,” she explains. Therefore, the protein supplements. However she cautions that if you increase protein consumption and not burn it off, it tends to settle as fat. However, there is a thing such as overdosing. While excess content is flushed out in the urine, there are other fat soluble vitamins (A, B, E, and K) that are stored in the fat and can cause damage.Meer Mustafa Hussain, paediatrician, says such nutritional supplements always have to be monitored. For older children, where the dietary consumption is far from satisfactory, doctors recommend supplements to fill a specific deficiency.So what is an ideal nutritive diet? Dr. Bajaj says that it would be 400-500 ml of skimmed milk, 4-5 serving of fruits, vegetables (of all colours) and whole grams along with 6 -11 of cereals; 1-2 portions of non-vegetarian food, along with plenty of fluids.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/No-substitute-for-balanced-diet/article16298914.ece

  Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi on Thursday ruled out power tariff hike for consumers and the withdrawal of free power supply scheme.There would be no room for agitations (on this issue), the Chief Minister told the Assembly during the debate on the demands for grants to the Energy Department.Earlier, Law Minister Durai Murugan, who moved the demands on behalf of ailing Electricity Minister Arcot N. Veeraswami, said the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board had recently submitted a tariff revision petition before the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission.“The current tariff proposal is a small step forward in the direction of correcting the tariff imbalances, affecting the [Tamil Nadu Electricity] Board and making it at least partially financially viable. While submitting the tariff revision petition, utmost care has been taken to spare agriculture and other needy and weaker sections of society from increase in tariff,” the Minister stated.No tariff hike was proposed for low tension domestic consumers who consumed up to 200 units bi-monthly, hut dwellers, places of worship and power loom weavers. Among high-tension consumers those who had taken power connection for lift irrigation were spared, he said.The Electricity Act of 2003 provides the scope, under Section 65, for the State government to grant subsidy to any consumer or class of consumers in the tariff determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission.When the government decides to provide subsidy, it has to compensate in advance the power utility concerned in the manner as the State Commission may direct.Besides, as per sub section 1 of section 108 of the law, the Commission, in its discharge of functions, would be guided by the State government's directions, expressed in writing, on matters of policy involving public interest.In June 2004, the AIADMK regime had invoked section 108 (1) of the Act and issued a policy directive to the TNERC, restoring concessions in tariff for domestic, agricultural and hut services.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Karunanidhi-rules-out-hike-in-power-tariff/article16298890.ece

1373,Khap panchayat: signs of desperation?,Jagmati Sangwan,2010-05-07,23:03:09 IST,"In Haryana today, rapid capitalist transformation is accompanied by a regressive feudal consciousness. As education and political awareness spread among Dalits, women and backward sections, alongside there is a massive consolidation of caste (
khap) panchayats in defence of the status quo. The number of cases in which the totally unconstitutional caste panchayats have openly defied the law of the land by issuing illegal diktats has increased manifold. Attacks on young couples, Dalits and progressive-minded people have become frequent.A recent landmark judgment by the Additional Sessions Court at Karnal in the Manoj-Babli “honour” killing case, in which five accused were given the death sentence, sent shock waves among caste panchayat leaders, as it reminded them that they were not above the Constitution. The court took serious note of the fact that the policemen deployed for the security of Manoj and Babli actually facilitated the accused in perpetrating the crime.Though geographically small, Haryana is socially and culturally heterogeneous. For example, in some areas and among certain castes, marriages within the village and even intra-
gotra marriages are not uncommon. At the same time, such marriages are treated as incest in certain other areas, and among other castes. Even the caste or khap panchayat is not a feature prevalent throughout the State, as many believe, but is confined to a particular region. Thus, a section of people of one particular caste proclaims itself as the cultural representative of Haryana, refusing to acknowledge the customs and traditions practised by others in their own neighbourhood.A look at the demography of the State and its development statistics would help to contextualise the problem. The State that stood second in per capita income in the country has one of the lowest sex ratios (821 in the 0-6 age group). Female foeticide is rampant, and the situation is so bad that wives are being brought from far off States. Not once have these panchayats called a maha-panchayat to pass a resolution against female foeticide or dowry or even in connection with the crisis in agriculture — problems staring the people of Haryana in the face.After the judgment in the Manoj-Babli case, however, a congregation of caste panchayats representing the Jat neighbourhoods from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan was called at Kurukshetra on April 13. It was decided that panchayats would now fight for legal status to legitimately maintain the “social order.” One of the main agendas of this sarv-khap panchayat was to push for amendments to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 that would ban marriages within the same gotra (clan within which men and women are considered siblings and hence cannot marry). Under this Act, marriages between certain lineages from the paternal and maternal sides are already barred.Most of the khap panchayat diktats are against couples who are not from the same gotra. In fact, not more than one case of honour killing has been of a couple within the same gotra. By creating the false impression that all marriages of choice between young couples are incestuous, what the khaps are actually opposing is the right to choose a marriage partner. Among the several instances of khaps issuing fatwas in Jaundhi, Asanda, Dharana, Singhwal, Hadaudi, Maham-kheri, Ludana and other villages, not a single one was an intra-
gotra marriage, yet the married couples were declared siblings, and families made to suffer boycotts and excommunication from their villages.A sad example of the gotra row is that of Ved Pal Moan, brutally beaten to death last year when he tried to secure his wife who was confined by her parents at Singhwal village in Jind district. He was escorted by a police party and a warrant officer of the High Court. Ved Pal had married neither within his gotra nor within the same village. In this case, another absurd code was invoked by the khap: that the couple violated the custom of not marrying in the neighbouring village as it forms part of bhaichara (brotherhood). A khap congregation held in March 2009 publicly pronounced the death sentence for Ved Pal, and it succeeded in executing it in June. As couples are selectively targeted, it is clear the real motive is to control women's sexuality to ensure that property remains within the patriarchal caste domain (mainly Jats in Haryana).The sarv khap panchayat also called for social boycott of individuals who raised their voice against the caste panchayats. A former police chief of Haryana, himself a self-styled caste leader, went on record threatening khap-critics. How can a former DGP publicly threaten law-abiding citizens, and yet continue to enjoy the hefty perks and pension out of the public exchequer?The caste panchayat leaders have decided to stifle any voice of assertion from the backward sections. On April 21 more than 20 houses of Dalits were burnt down at Mirchpur village, in the presence of a police force, allegedly by thugs belonging to a dominant caste, resulting in the death of an 18-year-old handicapped girl and her ailing father. A panchayat of khaps convened at Mirchpur three days after the carnage not only declared all arrested persons innocent but also issued an ultimatum to the government for their release! This was exactly the pattern adopted by caste panchayats in the Gohana (2005) and Duleena (2002) incidents, where brutal attacks on Dalits took place.Even elders from socially and economically weaker families are not spared. At Khedi Meham in December 2009, the father of a newly wed groom was forced to hold a shoe in his mouth in front of the whole village by the panchayatis. Ordinary citizens are caught in the contradiction between two sets of values — the blind consumerism of the neo-liberal dispensation, and the outdated feudal values represented by the khaps. The first is no replacement for the second, and indeed, pseudo-modernism only strengthens the forces of revivalism. The alternative to both types of distortions lies in the spread of healthy and progressive values that can be unleashed through only a new social reform movement in the entire Hindi belt.
Limited but crucial role
The judiciary does have a crucial role to play but has its limitations too. On June 23, 2008 Justice K.S. Ahluwalia of the Punjab and Haryana High Court made a revealing observation while simultaneously hearing 10 cases pertaining to marriages between young couples aged 18 - 21: “The High Court is flooded with petitions where … judges of this Court have to answer for the right of life and liberty to married couples. The State is a mute spectator. When shall the State awake from its slumber [and] for how long can Courts provide solace and balm by disposing of such cases?” A legislature with little political will and a pliant executive will have to be made responsive under pressure of a mass movement.The voices of dissent are also getting consolidated under the umbrella of organisations like the AIDWA and other democratic forces. The younger generation must stand forth as responsible social activists and lead the struggle for change in an otherwise feudal society that lives by the dictum “
Jiski lathi uski bhains” (the powerful call the shots). In Haryana each passing day is costing the lives of innocent women and men.

1374,Beating the summer heat,HARJEET KAUR,2010-05-07,16:32:41 IST,"A cool interior space uses chiks or blinds. Photo: N. Sridharan
  | Photo Credit: N_SRIDHARAN Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, sang Nat King Cole. The heat wave begins across India, especially south India, as early as March and by May the heat comes beating down. In summers, you don't just need coolers to beat the heat. Your home, too, requires a combination of colours and decor items to become a ‘cool' place to hang out in. The best thing to start preparing your home for summers is by focusing on the fabrics you choose for decorating your space.
Keep it light
It's time to pack away your heavy silks, chenilles and brocades on your sofas and switch to cool fabrics like cotton, linen and jute. If your sofas are upholstered in rich burgundy or deep plum, there's an easy way to get the summer look going. Keep a set of loose covers handy in linen or cotton and simply slip them on. These can be easily packed away once the heat is done. Make sure the colours are cool too: try vanilla, lime green, custard yellow, peach and apricot. If these are too bland for your bold tastes, throw in cushions in red, magenta, turquoise and orange. These will help balance the colour quotient and keep your home from looking too plain and pastel.Now, for the drapes. Here too the silks and brocades should be put away. “One can replace them with translucent and free-flowing materials which let in some light, yet keep your home cool. Voile, organza and chiffon are ideal material choices. Stick to floral and botanical prints as they tend to keep the ambience fresh and breezy,” suggests Archana, a homemaker. If your room gets too much sunlight, it's a good idea to opt for double curtain rails. One rod can be lined with heavy drapes while the other can have dainty lace or wispy sheers. Chiks or blinds are another option. You can get them custom-made as per the decor of your room.Less is more during summer as clear spaces allow for effective circulation of air around the house. So cut the clutter. Hibernate the heavy carpets and strew the floor with small area rugs or cotton dhurries, as the more floor you show, the cooler your home will look and feel. Pack away extra artefacts that may have made your space look cosy in winter and don't give you unhindered air circulation in summer. Sushmita, an interior decorator, suggests that if you have an extensive collection of art, it's a good idea to store away your bold oils and replace them with landscapes or watercolours. Keep fresh flowers like malli puvvu and jasmine in urlis filled with water to spread a fresh fragrance around the house.Don't forget your porch this summer. Use wicker chairs for a relaxed meeting with a friend. Use gaily-coloured cushions and have a basket of fruit on the table.
Decorating tips
*Try to give your wall a refreshing look either by painting with light colours or with wallpaper.*Add summer accessories to match the indoor colour. You can choose paper fans, birdhouses, fruit bowls, coloured stones, marbles or beach shells.*Replace dark lampshades with lighter ones or floral printed ones.*Make changes in your bathrooms too. Change to lightweight fabric flower curtains with matching hand towels.*A mirror in the wall that reflects the scenic beauty of garden into the living room can make a world of natural difference.*Candles and potpourri can lend a fragrant ambience on a summer evening",https://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/Beating-the-summer-heat/article16299046.ece

Anil Radhakrishnan,2010-05-07,02:28:11 IST,"The Airports Authority of India's (AAI) Rs.300-crore world class terminal complex of Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is to be formally commissioned on May 20.Union Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel is to dedicate the three-storey terminal building, having a tubular structure of elliptical geometry, that has come up facing the Parvathi Puthanar on Chakka side. Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan is to be the chief guest at the function.A top AAI official told The Hindu that the works were in full swing to commission the terminal on May 20. The Kerala State Electricity Board would provide power from the 66 kV second feeder and the Kerala Water Authority the sewerage connection this week itself.The 220-metre-long six-land bridge and two exclusive ramps connecting them from Chakka and Eenchakkal, constructed at a cost of Rs.21.73 crore by KITCO for the State government to connect the airport terminal to the National Highway 47 bypass had been completed .The black topping of the road and the bridge that has come across the Parvathy Puthanar will commence on Friday. “It will be completed by Sunday evening,” a KITCO official said.The AAI has completed the ramp to connect the approach road and the bridge to the parking bay in front of the terminal. The AAI is to take up the black topping.Fully funded by the AAI, the terminal was constructed by Chennai-based Consolidated Construction Consortium. The terminal building, with a maximum height of 19 m, has all the modern facilities, including escalators and elevators.The complex has 18 check-in counters, 20 immigration counters, 11 customs counters, two security gates, two baggage claim belts, a bus lounge and a Rs.5-crore sewerage system. The aerobridge procured from Indonesia has been installed.The four parking bays, constructed at a cost of Rs.14.5 crore, has been integrated with the existing 3,398-metre-long runway of the airport. With this, the aircraft can now reach the new terminal building at the Chakka side.Constructed using modern design concepts, the terminal building has been covered with heat reflecting toughened glass. The terminal will look like an aircraft from the tarmac.
Second phase
The Rs.80.58-crore second phase work for the Rs.245.58-crore terminal complex was also taken up along with the first phase. An additional 8,000 sq m of floor area was added with the lateral extension of the terminal building by 27 m on Karali side and 40 me on Chakka side. With this, the total floor area of the terminal complex has gone up to 30,000 sq m.In the Rs.165-crore first phase, work of the Rs.115-crore terminal building, apron and car park that can accommodate 575 cars was taken up.“The work for setting up the offices of the airlines and other stake-holders had commenced only recently and the terminal will start working only after a month,” the official said.Labour disputes over unloading of construction materials, non-availability of construction materials, unseasonal rain and delay on the part of the State to construct the approach road led to the revision of the deadline for the completion of the project scheduled for December 2008.Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Vijayakumar, accompanied by senior officials of the State and the AAI, is to inspect the terminal and review the progress of the work on Friday.Of the 48.56 hectares needed for the project, the government had handed over 11.15 hectares.

1384,Train service between Karur and Chennai sought,Staff Reporter,2010-05-07,02:33:21 IST,"Rail users and commuters from the district have called upon the authorities to introduce a day time train service between Karur and Chennai as also between Erode and Dindigul or Madurai to serve the area public better.Representing the demands the Divisional Rail Users Consultative Committee member A. Shahul Hameed has urged the Railway Minister and the Railway Board to consider their plea positively as the potential needs to be tapped even as the public would be served better through the services sought.Mr. Shahul Hameed pointed out that heeding the public plea for a Chennai-Karur train service, a new express train was introduced between Erode and Chennai from July 1, 2003.Since then it was first extended to Coimbatore and now to Mangalore and Karur travellers and public were finding it difficult to get accommodation in the service and they felt the service was there for them any longer.Karur, which is a bustling business centre, is starved of a day train service to connect the State capital.Though it was almost equidistant from Erode and Tiruchi, Karur train users were feeling the pinch of inadequate train services from the source, he added.It was in these circumstances that the Salem Division was taking steps to introduce a day train service between Erode and Chennai through Salem.Mr. Shahul Hameed observed that if the service were to be operated through Karur, Tiruchi and Villupuram, these areas could be served better. Salem region was already having some day train services to Chennai and the diversion would not be greatly troublesome for that area.Though Karur-Dindigul broad gauge has been in place for a long time now, enough passenger services were not being operated.People residing in areas such Velliyanai, Palayam, Eriyodu and other areas adjoining Karur and who used to come to Karur for work in textile units would be served better with the introduction of a passenger service between Erode and Madurai through Karur and Dindigul.As for the facilities and amenities at the Karur Junction, Mr. Shahul Hameed said that the station was suffering from manpower shortage and issuing of tickets was getting delayed putting commuters to great trouble.Long queues stand for a greater part of the day in front of the only reservation and current booking counter.The eleventh hour rush would be irksome for the public in a hurry to catch trains. Tickets are being issued even after the trains arrived at the platforms, he has noted, calling for appointing more staff.Inadequate drinking water facilities and toilet facilities plague the railway station and efforts to better them have not yielded the desired results so far.Authorities should look into the basic amenities needs of the public as soon as possible, he remarked.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/Train-service-between-Karur-and-Chennai-sought/article16298967.ece

The police took into custody 11 activists of the CPI (M) and took them to the Satyanarayanapuram police station, where other activists of the party staged a dharna demanding release of their colleagues and seeking action against the Congress activists.The trouble began when the activists of the CPI (M) interrupted the speech of Vijayawada Central MLA Malladi Vishnu. Over half-a-dozen activists surrounded the MLA with their representations and questioned the delay in completing the construction of houses meant for the poor in 53{+r}{+d} division.As Mr. Vishnu lost his cool, the Congress activists picked up an altercation with CPI (M) activists that led to a scuffle between the two groups. Following a complaint lodged by Congress activists, the Satyanarayanapuram intervened and took the activists of the CPI (M) into custody.CPI (M) leaders, accompanied by leaders of the CPI and the Telugu Desam Party, staged a dharna in front of the police station, finding fault with the police for not taking any action against the Congress activists.They withdrew the agitation only after an assurance was given by the police that cases would be registered against the Congress activists who were responsible for the scuffle.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/Scuffle-mars-Praja-Patham/article16298896.ece

What was needed was a change in its policies.He said it was very unfortunate that the CPI (M) had not learnt lessons from the “Singur debacle”.Land was acquired for the Nano car factory against the wishes of the people. It had now become a “corporate desert” with nothing being cultivated in it.The Nandigram incident that followed Singur clearly showed that the West Bengal government had scant respect for the voice of the people.Similarly, the Maoists who had a bad experience in Andhra Pradesh were rethinking their strategies and looking for an alternative.In Kerala too, the Left party activists and sympathisers were looking for an alternative, he said.Mr. Bhattacharya said that his party did not join hands with the 13 parties that organised the ‘Bharat Bandh' on April 27, but extended support to it independently.Going by the response of the people to the agitation, it was clear that the people were fed up with the policies of the UPA government.But some political parties at the last moment extended support to the Government defeating the cut motions in Parliament, he said.The Left party leader said that the agitation against price rise had become a movement.The CPI (ML) Liberation was demanding food security because there would be no national security without it.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/lsquoRealignment-of-Left-forces-on-the-cards/article16298895.ece

The free area will be exploited by pisciculture and agriculture farming thus tampering with the ecosystem, they had said.Headed by P. A. Aziz from Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), the panel would recommend to the government on the merits and demerits of the proposal of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly for reduction of the wildlife sanctuary, a government official said. Notified as a wildlife sanctuary in 1999, Kolleru is the largest fresh water lake in the country and home to 173 species of migratory and residential birds as per the Forest Department records. The panel has been asked to interact with all the stakeholders including the people's representatives of the area to study the issue with a holistic view keeping the interests of both the local people and the environment.“The committee would also look into the matter of paying compensation to the private landowners who are losing their lands to the wildlife sanctuary,” the official added. The committee has to submit its report within three months and a decision will be taken depending on its recommendations.It would also get a quick scientific survey of the entire area done through satellite mapping to get an actual picture of the status of the lake and the alignment of the contour lines.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/Kolleru-panel-to-study-proposal-to-reduce-wetland/article16298893.ece

  Visakha Container Terminal (VCT), which developed the country's deepest container terminal here, has achieved a growth of 11.8 per cent during 2009-10 beating the recessionary trend.The annual throughput was close to 1,00,000 TEUs -- the main exports being ferro alloys, aluminium ingots, seafood, minerals, chemicals, granites and garments. The main imports are refractory stuff, machinery and spares, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wood pulp, food and agro products.The advantage with VCT, which is in the process of emerging as an ideal gateway to shipping lines and customers connecting AP and rapidly growing hinterland of North, Central and North India with the overseas markets.VCT is a joint venture between Visakhapatnam Port and DP World and United Liner Agencies (P) Ltd. It commenced the operations in June 26, 2003. The terminal with a natural depth of 16.5 metres alongside can boast of being the only such facility in the country to accommodate the largest container vessel of today at any point of time.The terminal, which handled 11,516 TEUs in March -- the highest volume handled in a month -- has easy access to seven States within a distance of 750 km.“Our terminal is equipped with the necessary infrastructure, including two rail mounted quay cranes, two gantry cranes with rubber tyres and four reach stackers. It uses seamless connectivity for all operations and maintains ISO certified standards for operations, safety and environmental protection,” says VCT COO Capt. Sriram Ravi Chander.A welcome trend is the increase in the size of vessels calling at VCT due to growing hinterland. Vessels with capacities of 3,500 TEUs are now being handled. Currently, there are 48 lines registered with VCT. New lines are also showing interest due to increased importance of the port. Visakhapatnam Port, which is ranked second among all major ports in the country, offers a rebate of 35 per cent on vessel related charges (pilotage and port dues) for main line vessels and 25 per cent for feeder vessels having GRT of more than 27,000 providing vessel operators an impetus to line up more container cargo to Visakhapatnam.“With several projects in the pipeline, huge alumina and steel projects in AP, Chhattisgarh and Orissa, we are confident of registering a phenomenal increase in container traffic. There is also possibility of Nepal using VCT as an additional gateway to Kolkata for its export and imports,” points out Capt.

1393,Rosaiah's visit disappointing: BJP,Special Correspondent,2010-05-07,00:21:55 IST,"The Bharatiya Janata Party has expressed disappointment over the failure of Chief Minister K. Rosaiah to come out with something concrete for north Andhra during his recent visit to the place.Talking to media persons here on Thursday, official spokesman of the party J. Prithviraju said that Mr. Rosaiah was not only adept at jugglery of numbers during his State budget presentations over a dozen times, but also had now proved to be a juggler of words.“He was heard saying that since the State's finances were not sound, the government was unable to implement Jalayagnam as well as other welfare schemes, including Arogya Sri. But in Vizag, at the end of his two-day tour, Mr. Rosaiah stated that the State was financially sound and power supply and other welfare schemes were being implemented which came as a surprise,” he said.The BJP leader pointed out that Polavaram project alone would provide the answer to the water woes of the city but the government was not implementing it due to paucity of funds. Similarly, the pruning of seats from 6,000 to 3,000 at IIIT, failure to reimburse fee and release scholarships to backward classes students put the latter's future in jeopardy. “Regarding power from NTPC Simhadri, the 1000 MW it produced was meant for utilisation by Andhra Pradesh when it was commissioned here. Now, another 1,000 MW will be available after its expansion but the government is silent on its utilisation by the State. Also, no funds were released to VIMS Super-speciality hospital and the KGH buildings are in a dilapidated condition, needing renovation,” Mr. Prithviraju noted.He also said that the BJP in its bid to begin preparing for the municipal elections, would conduct a meeting on May 14 for coastal districts at Eluru, on May 15 at Anantapur for Rayalaseema region and on May 21 at Hyderabad for Telangana.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Rosaiahs-visit-disappointing-BJP/article16298888.ece

The industry is being set up with technical support from the Continental Carbon Limited of the US. Carbon black is used to reinforce the rubber.The first objection was about the brief Telugu version of the environment impact assessment report instead of a detailed report.Representatives of environmental groups, fishermen associations, Dalit organisations and NGOs explained about the damage the industry would cause. A similar industry in the US was closed in the face of opposition from the people after it caused lung cancer, skin diseases, etc.CPI (M) district secretary Ch. Narasinga Rao said no more pollution-causing industries would be allowed in the district. A carbon black making unit of 10,000 tonnes was set up in the district in 1985 but it was closed a year later when people protested. Damage caused by the Pudi unit would be more, he said. The number of jobs would be around 400 and not in thousands as the management claimed, Mr. Narasinga Rao said. Dalitula Bhoomula Hakkula Parirakshana Samiti K. Venkata Ramana dismissed the claim of factory management that the industry would not cause pollution. There was no industry without pollution, he said. Boosi Raju of Maala Mahanadu said the industry would only harm the people.T. Shankar of Traditional Fishermen Forum and another fisherman Bosanna said the industry would pollute the sea more and destroy marine life. Even the salt would get polluted, said Mr. Bosanna. Bhujanga Rao of Forum for Better Visakha strongly opposed setting up the industry as it would cause a lot of pollution.J.V. Ratnam of 100 Months Climate Protection Committee pointed out that one of the raw materials of carbon black was sludge from crude oil refinery units which would cause more pollution.It was banned even in the developing countries.Representatives of Save Nature and Paryavarana Praja Parirakshana Samiti of Hyderabad also opposed.There was some tension during the proceedings when Elamanchili MLA U.V. Ramana Murthy Raju (Kannababu) shouted at those opposing the industry and said they better bother about pollution in Visakhapatnam before trying to block an industry in this area. He stopped his criticism when people strongly protested.Out of the 27 speakers, 20 opposed. The MLA, local Sarpanch and another Congress leader supported and four consultants spoke in favour of the industry.Mr. Bhaskar said that the Government would go by people's opinion and added that if we needed one benefit, we have to lose another advantage.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Carbon-black-plant-opposed/article16298884.ece

Roxanne Gupta, an American citizen, performed ‘Bhama Kalapam'. The performance was followed by a question and answer session.“I thought that only a few persons would stay back to clarify their doubts but I was amazed to see not even a single person leaving the packed venue.

  While there is an increasing awareness of monuments, destruction of these treasures is also taking place, knowingly or unknowingly, School Education Minister Thangam Thennarasu said on Thursday.Addressing a meeting to distribute certificates to those who underwent an introductory course in Tamil epigraphy, he said it was a cause of concern that stone inscriptions, temple murals and other monuments that had survived hundreds of years were suddenly facing a threat.The course was conducted by the Academy of Archaeology and Sciences of Ancient India (AASAI), the education wing of REACH foundation.“They are not mere stones. Time has been preserved in the stones. Our ancestors protected these monuments despite the socio-political changes and wars. Now, it is our duty to protect and preserve them for the next generation.”“Mere awareness will not serve any purpose,” he said stressing, “We should join our hands to protect the monuments.”Recalling the announcement for creating heritage clubs in schools, the Minister said after the Classical Tamil Conference he would see to it that the task was completed.Noted archaeologist and Director, AASAI, T. Satyamurthy, said the course was to make more people read the inscription so that they would not treat monuments as unwanted material. “Once they are able to read it they will realise what is written on the wall in beautiful Tamil.”S. Rajavelu, Associate Professor, Thanjavur Tamil University, stressed the need for effective co-operation from people to protect monuments. “At least treat temples as a place of cultural importance if not treating them as place of worship.”Ravi Sam, Chairman, AASAI, said the students who underwent the course had already emerged as a watchdog group for protection of monuments.Swami Padmasthananda, secretary, Ramakrishna Mission, and S.
